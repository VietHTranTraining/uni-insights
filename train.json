{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Bullet to the Head", "Review": "Pop quiz! From \"Broken City\" to the gone-too-soon Starz series \"Boss\" to a hundred other movies and TV shows before that, we know the villain is utterly corrupted and beyond redemption when he reveals his master plan to be: A. Poisoning the water supply. B. Starting World War III so he can sell nuclear weapons to both sides. C. Kidnapping all the children and just the particularly cute small animals in town. D. Buying up housing projects so he can tear down the buildings, evacuate the good people and build condos and/or a shopping mall. Advertisement The correct answer, of course: D! That's the end game for the evil Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), a deposed African thug now walking stiffly and literally carrying a big stick in \"Bullet to the Head,\" an occasionally entertaining, often incomprehensible and ultimately quite average 1980s-homage mismatched buddy action pic. Morel is engineering a vast takeover of a plot of land in New Orleans so he can demolish the low-income housing and put up \u2026 condominiums! With high-end fixtures and marble bathroom floors! Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Geez. You couldn't get even one of the Avengers to don the costume and fly over to the Crescent City to put a stop to that mundane brand of evil? Directed by the veteran Walter Hill (\"48 Hrs.,\") and filled with cheesy stop-motion zooms; rapid-cut fight scenes with insanely loud sound effects for every bone-cracking punch; racially insensitive one-liners; window-dressing female characters, and wall-to-wall carnage, this is the kind of brainless action movie Sylvester Stallone would have starred in circa 1985. That it stars a Stallone who's closer to 70 than 60 is just \u2026 weird. Stallone plays lifelong criminal James Bonomo, who goes by the unfortunate nickname of Jimmy Bobo. That makes him sound more like a Howard Stern Wack Packer or a 1950s TV clown than a mercenary gun-for-hire who's so efficient, he should be working for the CIA or some Russian billionaire instead of kicking around the bowels of New Orleans, apparently barely scraping out a living. Of course \"Bullet to the Head,\" based on the graphic novel \"Du Plomb Dans la Tete\" and adapted by Alessandro Camon, works in some running jokes about Jimmy being a dinosaur. He doesn't really understand how the whole Google thing works, and there's a lot of \"not bad for an old man\" quipping from sidekicks and/or adversaries every time Jimmy comes out on top in a confrontation. Advertisement But this isn't Clint Eastwood playing some aging gunfighter clearly past his prime or a growling next-door neighbor in his 80s. Stallone/Jimmy is still freakishly muscled, the veins bulging from his arms and often-shirtless torso as if he's some Steroid Era slugger for the Oakland A's.  As Jimmy gets into one bloody brawl and deadly shootout after another, coming out on top every time of course, it's just a given that he's stronger, quicker, deadlier and a better shot than all these punks less than half his age. Why? Because he's Sly Stallone! He's narrating the movie! He's not going anywhere. After Jimmy and his partner Louis (Jon Seda) take down a mark who turns out to be a corrupt cop turned New Orleans thug, all hell breaks loose in the Big Easy. The strait-laced Det. Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang, best known in America for a few \"Fast and Furious\" movies) arrives from D.C. and finds himself paired up with Jimmy in a mutually beneficial pursuit of justice, even as he keeps reminding Jimmy he's eventually going to take down Jimmy as well. That's probably because Jimmy keeps on killing the bad guys before Kwon can arrest them and read them their Miranda rights. \"Bullet to the Head\" happily indulges in many action-pic cliches, including the amateur surgeon who expertly removes slugs from the whiskey-anesthetized shooting victim. (The slugs always make the same \"plinking\" noise when deposited into a metal tray that the non-surgeon apparently keeps on hand just in case.) And if you think this movie is going to avoid an extended confrontation in an abandoned warehouse, your expectations are way too high for a movie titled \"Bullet to the Head.\" To its credit, the film does take one overly familiar tableau and has great fun with it, thanks in large part to Christian Slater's performance as a wealthy drunken patsy who quickly realizes the folly of keeping quiet when there's a Stallone with a pair of pliers hovering over you. It's a hilarious scene. Advertisement The beautiful Sarah Shahi does what she can as Jimmy's tattoo artist daughter. Jason Momoa from \"Game of Thrones\" is a suitably bad-ass villain who looks like he could crush the much smaller and older Stallone \u2014 but then we wouldn't have much of a movie, would we? But Kang is overmatched keeping up with even a Stallone who's as old as a Rolling Stone. The classic buddy action pics of the 1980s worked because Danny Glover and Nick Nolte possessed the onscreen straight-man heft to withstand the acting pyrotechnics of Mel Gibson and Eddie Murphy, respectively. Here, we barely notice the little cop tagging along with Stallone. It takes two to tango, or even \"Tango & Cash.\""}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Southside With You", "Review": "As Michelle Robinson (Tika Sumpter) gets dressed in her home on the South Side of Chicago, her mother (Vanessa Bell Calloway) playfully teases her about the amount of effort Michelle is putting into her appearance. \u201cI thought this wasn\u2019t a date,\u201d she chides. Michelle insists it isn\u2019t. \u201cYou know I like to look nice when I go out,\u201d she says. When her father joins his wife in ribbing their daughter, Michelle digs in her heels about this being a \u201cnon-date\u201d. But it\u2019s clear the lady doth protest too much. In her mind, there\u2019s no way she\u2019s falling for the smooth-talking co-worker who invited her to a community event. She\u2019s seen this type of brother before, and she thinks she\u2019s immune to his brand of charm. Advertisement Soon, the brother in question, Barack Obama (Parker Sawyers), picks up Miss Robinson. Our first glimpse of him, backed by Janet Jackson\u2019s deliriously catchy 1989 hit \u201cMiss You Much,\" is a master class of not allowing one\u2019s meager means to interfere with one\u2019s confidence level. Barack smokes with the preternaturally efficient coolness of Bette Davis, yet drives a car built for Fred Flintstone. The large hole in the passenger side floor of his raggedy vehicle will not diminish his swagger nor derail his plan. Using the community event as a jumping-off point, he intends to gently push this non-date into the date category. So begins the romantic comedy \"Southside with You,\" a mostly-true account of the first date between our current President and the First Lady. Like \u201cBefore Sunrise,\u201d a film which invites comparison, \u201cSouthside with You\u201d is a two-hander that's top-heavy with dialogue, walking and a knowing sense of location. Unlike that film, however, we already know the ending before the lights go down in the theater. So, writer/director Richard Tanne replaces the suspenseful pull of \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d with an equally\u00a0compelling and understated character study that humanizes his larger-than-life public figures. Tanne reminds us that, before ascending to the most powerful office in the world, Barack and Michelle were just two regular people who started out somewhere much smaller. This down-to-earth approach works surprisingly well because \u201cSouthside with You\u201d never loses sight of the primary tenet of a great romantic comedy: All you need is two people whom the audience wants to see get together\u2014then you put them together. So many entries in this genre fail miserably because the filmmakers feel compelled to overcomplicate matters with useless subplots and extraneous characters; they mistake cacophony for complexity. \u201cSouthside with You\u201d builds its emotional richness by coasting on the charisma of its two leads as they carefully navigate each other\u2019s personality quirks and life stories. We may be ahead of them in terms of knowing the outcome, but we\u2019re simultaneously learning the details. Advertisement \u201cSouthside with You\u201d is at once a love song to the city of Chicago and its denizens, an unmistakably Black romance and a gentle, universal comedy. It is unapologetic about all three of these elements, and interweaves them in such a subtle fashion that they become more pronounced only upon later reflection. The Chicago affection manifests itself not only in a scene where, in front of a small group of community activists welcoming back their favorite son, Barack demonstrates a rough version of the speechmaking ability that will later become his trademark, but also when Barack takes Michelle to an art gallery. He points out that the Ernie Barnes paintings they\u2019re viewing were used on the Chicago-set sitcom \u201cGood Times.\u201d\u00a0Then the duo recite Chicago native Gwendolyn Brooks\u2019 poem about the pool players at the Golden Shovel, \"We Real Cool.\" Even the beloved founder of this site, Roger Ebert, gets a shout-out for championing \u201cDo the Right Thing,\" the movie Barack and Michelle attend in the closing hours of their date. Though its depiction of romance is recognizable to anyone who has ever gone on a successful first date, \u201cSouthside with You\u201d also takes time to address the concerns Michelle has with dating her co-worker, especially since she\u2019s his superior and the only Black woman in the office. The optics of this pairing worries her in ways that hint at the corporate sexism that existed back in 1989, and continues in some fashion today. Her concern is that her superiors might think she threw herself at the only other Black employee which, based on my own personal workplace experience, I found completely relatable. This plotline has traction, culminating in a fictional though very effective climactic scene between Barack, Michelle and their boss. It\u2019s a bit overdramatic, but the payoff is a lovely ice cream-based reconciliation that may do for Baskin-Robbins what Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cFormation\u201d did for Red Lobster. Heady topics aside, \u201cSouthside with You\u201d is often hilarious and never loses its old-fashioned sweetness. Sumpter\u2019s take on Michelle is a tad more on-point than Sawyers\u2019 Barack, but he compensates by exuding the same bemused self-assurance as his real-life counterpart. The two leads are both excellent, but this is really Michelle\u2019s show. Sumpter relishes throwing those \u201cyou think you\u2019re cute\u201d looks that poke sharp, though loving holes in all forms of braggadocio, and Sawyers fills them with surprising vulnerability. The two manage to create a beautiful tribute to enduring love in just under 90 minutes, making \u201cSouthside with You\u201d an irresistibly romantic and rousing success. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Citadel", "Review": "Ciaran Foy's \"Citadel\" is a horrifying thriller painted on a small and very dark canvas. Told through the eyes of a young husband named Tommy (Aneurin Barnard), it opens on a sweet note and quickly turns tragic. He kisses his very pregnant wife goodbye and descends in an elevator to deliver their luggage to a taxi for the trip to the hospital. When he returns to their floor, he watches helplessly through the elevator window as three hooded youngsters savagely attack her. The door won't open, of course. The elevator forcibly returns him to the lobby, and after Tommy races up 11 flights of stairs, he finds his wife has been attacked with a hypodermic needle. Why didn't he and his wife both go down with the luggage? Not to ask. Advertisement His wife lives long enough to deliver their baby daughter, then dies, leaving Tommy a panic-crazed basket case who becomes agoraphobic and imagines he sees the three hooded monsters everywhere \u2014 hunched over, scuttling sideways, merciless. \"Citadel,\" ironically the name of the couple's building, is basically a three-character movie about Tommy, a priest (James Cosmo) and a helpful social worker named Marie (Wunmi Mosaku). The social worker advises Tommy to pity the poor kids, who must be from broken homes. The priest all but goes berserk in condemning the kids and exhorting Tommy that he must go into battle against them. He says they're demonic, and indeed there seems to be something demonic and wraithlike about their creepy appearances. I believe that young people wearing hoods, unless they are very young, can be frightening. What are they hiding? Why don't they want to come out into the light with the rest of us? They may be perfectly nice, but the hoods send an uncertain statement. An innocent young man named Trayvon Martin, for example, paid with his life when his hood projected a knee-jerk message. These three murderers, sometimes joined by a few more, seem very real when we first see them. Later they have a way of taking form in a strange unfocused light. Are they always real or does Tommy sometimes imagine them? This is a basic story, simply and directly told by Irish writer-director Ciaran Foy. He doesn't try to explain too much, he doesn't depend on special effects and stays just this side of the unbelievable. As Tommy, Aneurin Barnard is very effective. He trembles and sweats with fear, he would seem paranoid if it didn't seem the \"demons\" weren't really there, and if they hadn't really killed his wife. The priest enlists Tommy in a scheme to destroy the Citadel and send the demons back to the flames of hell. This would be a better plan if they didn't start at the ground floor and work their way up. Think about it. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Amador", "Review": "Here is a lovely idea for a film, sidetracked by a central performance that is too maddeningly passive. \"Amador\" introduces us to Marcela, a Bolivian woman now living in Madrid with Nelson, a man who runs an ingenious business: He hires scavengers to swarm down on a garbage dump and pick up discarded flowers that still look halfway presentable. They wash them, store them in a refrigerator, spray them with flowery scent, wrap them in paper, and send their team out to peddle them on the street and in cafes. I have a feeling I may have purchased a few roses with that lineage from flower girls in Cannes. Advertisement Their refrigerator breaks down. There is a crisis in making the payments on a replacement, and Marcela (Magaly Solier) takes a job as a daytime companion for Amador (Celso Bugallo), an old man who rarely leaves his bed and passes his days assembling big jigsaw puzzles. He loves scenes of sea and sky, because the whites and blues blend together and make them trickier. Marcela is a warm, soulful woman who is unhappy with her life. When Nelson talked her into moving with him to Madrid, he painted a future where they'd have their own flower shop. Now she hardly has a home; the business is run out of their apartment, and when Nelson mounts letters on the refrigerator door spelling out \"Marcela's Flowers,\" somehow that doesn't seem what he promised. Amador is quiet and pleasant, suspecting his time has about run out. Marcela met Yolanda (Sonia Almarcha), his daughter, when she and her husband hired her, but they have never visited. Marcela cooks Amador's meals, helps him sit on the pot and makes desultory conversation. Much of the film involves close-ups of her face, thoughtful and pensive, as she ponders her life. Too much of the film. It is not Magaly Solier's fault that her character seems so passive. We see a personality in the film, but not enough of it. Her long days pass as she discusses romance, mermaids and her own life with Amador, who notices immediately that she's pregnant. That's something she hasn't told Nelson, and of course, he hasn't noticed. Amador observes that the world has too many people: \"But don't worry. I'm on my way out, to make a space for him.\" Once a week, on Thursdays, Amador receives a visit from Puri (Fanny de Castro), a plumpish, middle-aged prostitute who has been visiting him for years. She's a wise, friendly woman and helps Marcela pass the time. The peace is also interrupted by a nosy neighbor who keeps trying to push his way in. It wouldn't be fair to describe more of what happens. We've been rather expecting it, and the way the writer-director, Fernando Leon de Aranoa, handles it is effective and holds a series of surprises. Simply on the story level, \"Amador\" could have been a better film. But his pacing is off. Time and again, we get languid closeups of Marcela as the cogs turn in her mind, and she arrives belatedly at fairly obvious conclusions. It might have been possible to produce a much better film just by tighter editing. The symbolism, mostly involving flowers (which we prize for their beauty, even when they're dead), is pretty obvious. So also the sea and sky, and speculation about mermaids. A late disclosure from the unloving daughter Yolanda provides an ending that is heartless, ironic and \"happy,\" all at the same time. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "As I AM: The Life and Time$ of DJ AM", "Review": "\"As I AM: The Life and Time$ of DJ AM\" plays the same sad song of Bill Evans, the late Prince and countless others: a ballad about talented, influential creators who took their music to another level while dealing with destructive addiction. With a proper focus, both on the specific and universal, this type of tale can have its unique soul, proven here by this emotionally gripping doc about Adam Goldstein, known in the turntable world as DJ AM.\u00a0 Director Kevin Kerslake explores Goldstein\u2019s life, providing a full portrait of a person who signifies a huge change in modern music. He was a symbol of a pop period, his mash-up style of mixing one pop song with another a type of innovation for clubs that played repetitive house music, creating a type of artistry not commercially measured in album sales but gig paychecks and the star status of celebrity clientele. To Kerslake's credit, that last sentence was written with great help from his documentary, which proves to be equally informative and inclusive about its focal art and artist.\u00a0 Advertisement With an endless amount of talking heads (including every notable DJ one can think of, from Steve Aoki to Diplo to Jazzy Jeff and beyond), Kerslake provides a full portrait of a friend, innovator, drug addict, sobriety advocate, sneaker fiend, plane crash survivor and icon of the scene. Goldstein says he is a person of extremes, whether it's work ethic, shoes or anything else. Kerslake\u2019s assembly matches this with a head-first dive into Goldstein\u2019s world, covering so many different details with so many different personal testimonies, from the life narrative of his childhood obesity to his cameo in Jon Favreau\u2019s \u201cIron Man 2.\u201d\u00a0 As with many success stories, the focus on DJ AM as a \"the first rock star of hip-hop DJs\" makes for a few flat passages, that dumb dollar sign in the title revealing bits of tackiness. And the story does have a heavy coating of testosterone; when DJ Samantha Ronson calls him \"a total dude,\" it is both darkly funny and urgent about the scene. But Kerslake keeps the film grounded to his selflessness as a person and his work ethic, perhaps even spending a few too many minutes on how great a guy he was (to his homies, at least). For fans and non-fans, \"As I AM: The Life and Time$ of DJ AM\u201d is a curious look into a different breed of music brilliance. Up-close performance footage shows his technique in the booth, scratching up records with sprightly fingers on the dials and switches; we hear a mash-up come together, allowing us to appreciate the assembly and the pay-off when two completely different pop songs share a tune.\u00a0 Keeping with the shaping form of its music, music video director Kerslake treats it with a busy pop aesthetic. Also working as his own cinematographer, he captures some vivid imagery for his B-roll, like a turntable going up in flames to create original expressions on Goldstein's drama. Footage from outlets like Hollywood.TV prove more convenient than revealing of the doc's limits; it has the content but not the type of resonating commentary about the fame and access that ultimately had a negative effect on DJ AM. Of all moments, shots of DJ AM's funeral are invasive, and don't have the same type of tragedy as a similar private moment stolen by cameras later used in the similar \"Amy.\"\u00a0 One impressive narrative decision involves spending the last 40 minutes on the last year of DJ AM's life, as compared to the last 34 years covered in the first hour. Kerslake focuses on his PTSD from a plane crash in 2008, when he was in spotlight as an anti-addiction advocate on an MTV show while privately trying to stay sober on prescribed pain medication. In its distinct offering to a field of musician bio documentaries, Kerslake's film offers a raw body-and-soul tale of fighting addiction.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Forbidden Room", "Review": "Ever\r\nsince he first burst upon the scene in 1988 with his hypnotic debut feature\r\n\"Tales from the Gimli Hospital,\" Guy Maddin has been one of those\r\nfilmmakers whose new work I most eagerly look forward to seeing. In a time when\r\nmost movies are little more than filmed deals that can spend millions of\r\ndollars on elaborate special effects sequences that fade from the mind almost\r\nas soon as they play out, he has created some of the most bizarre, hilarious,\r\nhaunting and memorable imagery that I have ever seen in a film\u2014who could\r\nforget the sight of beer baroness Isabella Rossellini standing upon artificial\r\nlegs filled with her own product in \"The Saddest Music in the World,\" or the horses stuck in the middle of a frozen river in \"My Winnipeg\"?\r\nEven if the films themselves do not entirely work as a whole (not that this\r\nhappens very often), one can always be certain that one or two moments that will go straight into your movie memory bank. Advertisement His\r\nlatest film is \"The Forbidden Room,\" co-directed with Evan Johnson. Even by Maddin's standards, it is\r\na pretty wild ride in all aspects, starting with its very concept. From what I\r\nhave been able to gather, the initial inspiration was a pair of museum\r\ninstallations in Paris and Montreal in which Maddin and a small crew would\r\nshoot a complete short film a day while the public looked on, and the resulting\r\nfilms are to be a part of a future interactive website project. The conceit\r\nbehind the individual films is that they were all inspired by titles of old\r\nfilms that have either been lost or which were never made in the first place.\r\nHere, they have all been combined into a hallucinatory fantasia in which more than\r\n18 different narratives bounce off of and flow into each other in unexpected\r\nways, while Maddin presents them in a style reminiscent of the era\r\nspanning the end of the silent era and the beginning of the talkies. The film\r\nopens with the faux-educational film \"How to Take a Bath,\" in which a\r\ncreepy old man instructs viewers on the finer points of bathing while we see\r\npeople putting his theories into practice. From there, we journey to a\r\nsubmarine in imminent danger of disaster\u2014the captain has gone nuts, a case of\r\n\"explosive jelly\" has gone bad and will blow up if the sub tries to\r\nsurface, and there is only two days of oxygen left. (Luckily, the crew is able\r\nto extend their breathing time thanks to their all-pancake diet\u2014they are able\r\nto consume the air bubbles contained in said griddle cakes.) The turmoil of the\r\ncrew is interrupted by the inexplicable arrival of a novice lumberjack (a\r\n\"saplingjack,\" if you will) with a story to tell about his efforts to\r\nrescue the fair Margot from a fearsome gang known as the Red Wolves\u2014to\r\ninfiltrate the gang, he must endure a series of trials that includes offal\r\npiling and bladder slapping contests. For her part, Margot soon disappears into\r\nher own dream world where she becomes an amnesiac flower girl, sings in a nightclub\r\nand lands on an island with volcanoes, squid thieves and a \"Lost\r\nGeneration attorney\" with whom she has a brief lesbian affair. Needless\r\nto say, there is much more. A surgeon who has spent virtually his entire life\r\nat the Oracle Bones Hospital and who is said to have \"never been more than\r\none hundred paces from the bones\" saves a woman suffering from multiple\r\nbone fractures following a motorcycle accident\u2014he takes her to an island\r\nparadise to propose, but at the last second is kidnapped by \"The Skull-Faced\r\nMan and his gang of Skeletal Insurance Defrauders,\" all decked out in\r\npoisonous leotards. Other characters are somehow transformed into mutated\r\nbananas. A man forgets to get his wife a birthday present, and instead creates a\r\nruse that requires him to murder his butler at one point. The family of the\r\ndead man hardly notices, and a recording of his voice winds up filling most of\r\nhis usual duties. Another gift-related incident goes wrong when a man buys his\r\nbeloved a statue of Janus, and winds up creating a malevolent double of himself\r\ndubbed \"Lug Lug\u2014Hideous Impulse Incarnate.\"  Advertisement The end\r\nresult is a head-spinner to be sure\u2014not only does it not make any sense in the\r\ntraditional definition of the word, it doesn't even attempt to do so\u2014and those\r\nwho demand that their films offer up some kind of conventional narrative\r\nstructure will no doubt throw up their hands and leave early on in the\r\nproceedings. Those that stick it out, however, will be rewarded with one\r\ndelight after another. Technically, it is a delight from start to finish that\r\ncinema buffs will adore for how Maddin and his crew have somehow\r\nmanaged to take something that was shot digitally and give it the look and feel\r\nof something shot around 1930 and misplaced soon afterwards. There is\r\nalso a lot of wit on display here, with Maddin and his four co-writers deploying\r\neverything from jet-black humor to surreal silliness to pure and unadulterated\r\ngoofiness and hitting their targets more often than not. In this regard, Maddin & Johnson have lucked into a cast that is for the most part on his particular wavelength, and are able to properly sell the oddball material. Among the familiar faces\r\nthat pop up here, sometimes in multiple roles, are Udo Kier, Mathieu Amalric,\r\nCaroline Dhavernas, Geraldine Chaplin, Maria de Mederios and the divine\r\nCharlotte Rampling, an actress whose entire career has been dedicated to the\r\nkind of risk-taking spirit that this film celebrates in every single scene. The only\r\nreal flaw with \"The Forbidden Room\" is that it is pretty much the\r\ndictionary definition of the phrase \"too much of a good thing.\" As\r\nanyone who has seen Maddin's stunning 2000 short film \"The Heart of the\r\nWorld\" (possibly the pinnacle of his career) can attest, he can cram more\r\ncomplex storytelling and memorable imagery into a few minutes of screen time\r\nthan most filmmakers can muster in an entire career. That is certainly the case\r\nhere but with a running time just under two hours, even Maddin's most ardent\r\nfans may find themselves getting exhausted after a while from the sheer\r\nonslaught of visual overload. And yet, while it might have gone down easier at\r\na slightly reduced running time, I cannot easily think of anything in it that I\r\nwould want to drop in order to achieve that goal.  \"The\r\nForbidden Room\" is weird, esoteric, and probably not the ideal entry\r\npoint for curious moviegoers who have not yet experienced the glory of a Guy\r\nMaddin film for themselves\u2014those people might be better served with a look at\r\n\"The Saddest Music in the World.\" For those who have enjoyed his work\r\nin the past and those who like to be a little adventurous when it comes to\r\ntheir moviegoing, this is the kind of audacious filmmaking that\r\ndeserves to be recognized and which will no doubt inspire any number\r\nof impassioned discussions among its viewers while having dinner afterwards. Be\r\nsure to get the pancakes\u2014you'll need them.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Murder on the Orient Express", "Review": "I know. I KNOW. Ever since seeing the trailer for the mystery thriller \u201cMurder on the Orient Express,\u201d a question has been nagging at you. It\u2019s not who among a diverse array of actors including Judi Dench as a Russian princess, Willem Dafoe as a German professor, Penelope Cruz as a depressed missionary and Johnny Depp as a thuggish art dealer, is the killer. But why has a small furry mammal disguised as a magnificent beast of a handlebar mustache in 50 shades of silvery gray taken up residence under Kenneth Branagh\u2019s nose? Advertisement The hair apparent\u00a0seems specifically designed to practically steal every scene it appears in during this sumptuous yet ultimately stuffy and overstuffed big-screen return visit to Agatha Christie\u2019s most durable novel. It's even responsible for the film\u2019s best sight gag. If Branagh, the star and director behind the 21st-century digitally-enhanced stab at bringing this ensemble vehicle back to life wanted to make a statement to distinguish this take on his world-famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot from any other, he certainly has. In the 1974 movie adaptation helmed by Sidney Lumet, Albert Finney sported a pert black swatch with Dali-esque twirls at the ends. Boring, right? Branagh\u2019s fuzzy wuzzy is like an ocean wave of whiskers, from ear to shining ear. Best supporting player? That honor goes to that dashing splash of a soul patch on his chin.\u00a0\u00a0  OK, I am stalling. Let\u2019s accentuate the positive first. The script by Michael Green (\u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d) does a bang-up job of introducing us to Poirot, a fuss-budget stickler who demands perfectly cooked four-minute eggs and tsk-tsks their imperfect dimensions\u2014and then doesn\u2019t even bother to eat them. He is a control freak who insists on balance in everything, from how a tie sits around a man\u2019s neck to impeccably baked bread. The place is Jerusalem (actually, Malta as a stand-in) and the year is 1934. Poirot is at the Wailing Wall about to deliver the solution to a crime tied to three clerics of different faiths and a stolen artifact. With the showbiz panache of a Vegas magician, he reveals the perpetrator with an unexpected flourish involving a cane. That sends the message, \u201cHey, this could be fun.\u201d But matters get perfunctory rather quickly when fellow passengers whose baggage clearly includes secrets begin to pop up, including Daisy Ridley (Rey in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d) as a porcelain-skinned governess and Leslie Odom Jr. (Aaron Burr in Broadway\u2019s \u201cHamilton\u201d) as a doctor who attempt to disguise they are an interracial couple. Those marquee credits are bound to draw in the under-30 demographic. But, alas, the only fully fleshed-out being turns out to be Poirot, who moons over a portrait of a lost love and undergoes an existential crisis of sorts when he finds himself unexpectedly confounded when a dead body turns up on the train with an even dozen stab wounds. The luxury locomotive traveling from Istanbul to Calais also comes to a halt about a half-hour in when an avalanche causes it to stop in its tracks atop a dangerous trestle. I wish I could say that the storyline at least picks up steam, but it never quite does especially since it devolves into a series of private interrogations by the imperious Poirot in a caf\u00e9 car.  Advertisement Michelle Pfeiffer does what she can as a man-hungry rich widow searching for her next husband. Derek Jacobi and Josh Gad conspire as a valet and assistant to Depp\u2019s scar-faced hoodlum. Other performers barely have the presence or enough dialogue to make much of an impression including the incredibly talented Olivia Colman as Dench\u2019s lady in waiting. In addition, there are veiled allusions to the 1932 kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh\u2019s baby son, which few besides history buffs will recognize today.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Branagh, the actor, comes through unscathed.

But despite camera trickery with ineffective overhead shots and a long one-take scene as Poirot boards the moving train, there is too little levity and cleverness afoot, especially with a cast whose talent is barely tapped. The key isn\u2019t whodunit but how you do it.\u00a0 However, that mustache\u2014which even grows limp and messy when matters get dicey for Poirot\u2014deserves a place in the pantheon of great follicle-ly enhanced performances.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Fred Claus", "Review": "Know how a character in one movie can be so terrific, another movie is spun off just to take advantage? That happened with Ma and Pa Kettle, who had small roles in \"The Egg and I,\" which led to their very own series. But enough of today's seminar on the history of cinema. What I'm wondering is whether a scene can inspire a spinoff. I'm thinking of the best scene in \"Fred Claus,\" which takes place at a 12-step support group for brothers of famous people. Maybe it's called Recovering Siblings Anonymous. Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn), who has suffered all of his life in the shadow of his beloved younger brother, Santa Claus, sits in the circle and shares. Also at the meeting are Roger Clinton, Frank Stallone and Stephen Baldwin, and I'm not spoiling a laugh, because it's what they say that is so funny. Advertisement I'm thinking, too bad Billy Carter didn't live to steal this movie. But there are plenty more brothers to go around. Neil Bush comes to mind. How about Clint Howard, although he's been doing well lately? Or Jeffrey Skilling of Enron, now serving 24 years while his brother Tom is a popular and respected Chicago weatherman? This could be a movie like the Fantastic Four, where the brothers form a team. Tom Skilling screws up the weather forecast at the North Pole after Clint Howard feeds him bad info from a garbled headset at Santa's Mission Control, and Neil Bush saves the day by arranging for an executive pardon. If you at least chuckled during my pathetic attempt at humor, that's more than may happen during long stretches of \"Fred Claus,\" which has apparently studied \"Elf\" and figured out everything that could have gone wrong with its fish-out-of-water Christmas fable. The movie begins centuries ago in the Black Forest, when Mr. and Mrs. Claus and their first son, Fred, welcome a new bundle of joy: Nicholas Claus. Fred vows he will be the bestest big brother little Nicky could ever hope for, but alas, Nicholas is such a paragon that you can't get over him, you can't get around him, and all Fred can do is go under him, in a bitter and undistinguished life. Think about it. What does Santa (Paul Giamatti) need with a brother? He's one-stop shopping. It gets worse. Nicholas Claus becomes a saint. And it turns out, in a development previously unreported by theologians, that if you're a saint, you and your family live forever. Yes! So Fred has to be St. Nick's brother forever and ever after. And this sad old planet would benefit, according to the Catholic count, by at least 10,000 immortal saints, although the church reassures us with some confidence that they are all in heaven. Flash forward to, yes, Chicago. Vince Vaughn should earn some kind of grace just for bringing this production to his hometown. He is in love with a meter maid (Rachel Weisz), who has moved here from London, which explains her accent if not her job choice. Fred stays pretty much out of touch with his famous kid brother, until he gets in a financial squeeze and has to call Santa for a $50,000 loan to open an off-track betting parlor across from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -- not a bad idea, actually. Advertisement The action moves to the North Pole and involves the flint-hearted Clyde Northcutt (Kevin Spacey), who is cracking down on cost overruns at the Pole, for who, I'm not sure. That leads to turmoil among the elves, and Fred at last finds his role in life, but see for yourself. The movie wants to be good-hearted but is somehow sort of grudging. It should have gone all the way. I think Fred Claus should have been meaner if he was going to be funnier, and Santa should have been up to something nefarious, instead of the jolly old ho-ho-ho routine. Maybe Northcutt could catch Santa undercutting his own elves by importing toxic toys from China, and Fred could save the lives of millions of kids by teaming up with Shafeek Nader."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Ragnarok", "Review": "A sleepy, but pleasantly surprising action-adventure, \r\n\"Ragnarok\" is the rare Spielberg clone that feels like it was made by \r\npeople that not only know what they like about Spielberg's films, but \r\nare capable of evoking them. Sigurd (Pal Sverre \r\nHagen), a head-in-the-clouds archaeologist that gets terrorized by a \r\ngiant snake monster while looking for Viking artifacts, is a cross \r\nbetween Indiana Jones and Dr. Alan Grant. Which is to say: he's a \r\nbenignly egocentric single dad that realizes by the film's end that \r\nknowledge should be shared, not monetized, and women and children aren't\r\n accessories. Sigurd's quest grants him genuine perspective, and makes \r\nhim realize that he's not that different from his miserly boss, \r\nhead-strong subjects, or serpentine tormentor. These revelations \r\nmodestly unfold at their own leisurely pace, and are supplemented by \r\nsome modestly impressive brick-and-mortar action filmmaking, \r\nparticularly good use of slow-motion photography, and an exciting \r\nzipline set piece. \"Ragnarok\" could stand to be a little less timid, but\r\n it also handily proves that you don't need to be bombastic to be \r\nexciting.\"Ragnarok\" begins with a weary, perfunctory preface: in\r\n the 9th century, a bunch of fool-hardy Vikings set out to test their \r\nmettle. They wind up getting attacked by a giant snake. The snake \r\ndoesn't really get to mess anybody up, and the Vikings are only shown \r\nskulking around for a bit. Which sucks, since this placeholder intro is \r\nsupposed to hold viewers over for an hour, when we get the film's first \r\nmajor action scene. Then again, that shortcoming isn't such a bad thing \r\nwhen you consider how effectively the film's characters and concerns are\r\n established an hour in. It's easy to forgive \"Ragnarok\"'s creators for \r\nwhat they overlooked given the little, personal touches thrown in.When\r\n we first meet Sigurd, a widower with two kids, he only has eyes for his\r\n job. He's obsessed with some recently uncovered runes, but the \r\nmoney-men that pay for his research aren't impressed with his passion \r\nand theoretical knowledge. So Sigurd teams up with fellow archaeologist \r\nAllan (Nicolai Cleve Broch) and research assistant Elisabeth (Sofia \r\nHelin), and drags his kids to Finmark, the Northern-most part of Denmark,\r\n in search of grant-worthy booty.\u00a0 Advertisement Here's\r\n where \"Ragnarok\" proves that its creators get how crucial \r\ncharacterization is to the success of Spielberg fantasies like \"Jurassic\r\n Park\" and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" Neither Sigurd \r\nnor Elisabeth need to go through the ringer to prove that they're \r\nscatterbrained problem-solvers that can also empathize enough to care \r\nfor children. It's not an either/or deal. Elisabeth puts a fine \r\npoint on that notion when she smiles and tells Sigurd's daughter \r\nRagnhild (Maria Annette Tandero Berglyd) that \"Family is not really my \r\nthing.\" Then she smiles warmly after Ragnhild tells her of her mother's \r\npassing, and spreads bug spray on the girl's face. It's a touching, \r\nsmall moment that rings true thanks to Berglyd and Helin's apparent \r\nchemistry.\u00a0 It also goes a \r\nlong way towards revealing the film's unsentimental priorities, \r\nparticularly the film's adoration for Sigurd, and his habit of figuring \r\nout his priorities as he messes them up. Sigurd's usually too enamored \r\nwith his research to see beyond himself, but viewers can tell where his \r\nheart is in a slow-motion sequence where he pulls son Brage (Julian \r\nPodolski) away from danger. Svendsen's stare shows that he's both angry \r\nand terrified. His bulging eyes are blocked just right, drawing \r\nattention away from his mouth. It's a really good, finely observed \r\nmoment that could have easily been forgettable, and by-the-numbers. You \r\ncan also see why \"Ragnarok\" roots for Sigurd in the scene where Svendsen\r\n emerges from a dark tunnel armed only with a snake egg and a torch. \r\nSvendsen's too wiry and unkempt to be a Scandinavian Indiana Jones, but \r\nhe looks almost as heroic. It's a beautiful, front-lit shot that draws \r\nout the shimmering inky darkness at the actor's back. The camera doesn't\r\n linger on Svendsen, but that image stays with you. By\r\n now, even I'm convinced I'm talking \"Ragnarok\" up too much. It is a fun\r\n genre film with subtle power that really captures the imagination, though \r\nyou've seen this story many times before, and have heard it told in far \r\nbetter ways. It's rote in some ways, and takes too damn long to get to \r\nsome really good stuff, but when I set out to write this review, I found\r\n myself immediately drawn to its best bits. The film's highs really do \r\nmake the lows seem insignificant. I hope more people check out \r\n\"Ragnarok\" for that reason alone.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Battle in Seattle", "Review": "\"Battle in Seattle\" takes the actual 1999 protests against a summit meeting of the World Trade Organization and uses them as a backdrop for a fictional story about characters swept up in the tumult. The result is not quite a documentary and not quite a drama, but interesting all the same. It uses the approach of Haskell Wexler's \"Medium Cool\" (1969), but without the same urgency; Wexler's actors were plunged into the actual demonstrations at the 1968 Chicago Democratic National Convention, and \"Battle\" is not as convincing. Advertisement Much of the story involves an unnecessary romantic attraction between Jay (Martin Henderson), leader of the protesters, and Lou (Michelle Rodriguez), a member of the movement. They have to have disputes about tactics and motivations, etc., while drawing closer together, and in this context, they're just a distraction. More to the point is Dale, the cop (Woody Harrelson) whose pregnant wife (Charlize Theron), a bystander, is caught up in the crowd and beaten by police. Dale asks for leave time, but is ordered back on the street by his commanding officer and releases his grief through rage. Harrelson's emotional arc in the film is convincing and effective. But what to make of Jean, the TV newswoman (Connie Nielsen), who plunges with her cameraman into the thick of the fighting, ignores orders from her station and becomes sympathetic? Yes, it happens (a lot of reporters covering the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina vented their anger at FEMA). That's not the problem. What seems odd is that she always seems to be at the crossroads between the action and the film's subplots, always is there for dramatic moments on video, and most of the time is the only TV news presence in the movie. Street reporters and their camera operators tend to congregate at the same hotspots. Those glitches aside, \"Battle in Seattle\" makes a case for the way the WTO punishes Third World nations, allows the dumping of surpluses that drive workers away from jobs and is managed for the benefit of fat-cat nations. Some of the disagreement about the big Wall Street bailout reflects anger about the way money protects itself; should there be even a question that the executives who steered their companies into bankruptcy should be stripped of their multimillion-dollar bonuses? Most people have never quite understood why there are protests worldwide about the WTO. \"Battle in Seattle,\" which marks the feature-film directorial debut by actor Stuart Townsend, has a commendable prologue and some dialogue that helps explain, but for a very moving ground-level documentary that makes it all crystal clear, you might want to rent \"Life and Debt\" (2001), which is a closeup portrait of the destruction of small Jamaican farmers and the exploitation of workers. Would you believe the WTO pushes Third World nations into establishing poverty-wage barbed-wire enclaves for multinational corporations, inside of which local laws and protections do not apply? My review of \"Life and Debt\" is online at www.rogerebert.com. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Lore", "Review": "\u201cLore\u201d gets right down to business. We're in Germany at the end of World War II, watching a large, once-prosperous family pack hurriedly to avoid the onslaught of Allied forces. A Swastika emblem on a discarded piece of clothing tells us we're dealing not with mere German citizens but Nazis. No wonder the mother looks petrified as she torches documents and the father flees at the first opportunity. Other than the rather slovenly father, this is one gorgeous family. The mother might as well be Marlene Dietrich in her prime. The eldest daughter looks like a Leni Riefenstahl Aryan goddess. Her four younger siblings have been spared none of the stunner genes. That these Hitler Youth are easy to watch on a superficial level seems part of director Cate Shortland's strategy: We are about to see these beauties trudge through every muddy, thorny stretch of the Black Forest, into the kind of indignities and horrors their parents' political party inflicted upon the Jews. We know where this is going pretty early on, but that doesn't prevent \u201cLore\u201d from being riveting stuff, start to finish. Advertisement The focus shifts from the mother, doomed to face Allied justice for her and her husband's apparent connection to a concentration camp, to Lore (Saskia Rosendahl), the daughter whose coming of age happens alongside her awakening to the truth: Hitler, her Santa Claus, her Jesus, presided over genocide. Shortland is a sensualist, using constantly shifting handheld cameras shooting tight and close to make each step of Lore's education a palpable event. When she leads her siblings through the forest on a quest to grandmother's house, it ain't fairytale stuff. We see poorly shod feet set down in mud puddles, skin scratched and bruised by jutting branches, the air crowded with insects, smoke, mist, rain. Shortland seems determined to represent every kind of sensation and yearning in image and sound. Which is why it doesn't raise eyebrows much when this film starts to become as obsessed with Lore's sexual awakening as it does her political one. Shortland's way into a scene is holistic: Lore's physical and emotional response to events merit equal scrutiny; each draws current from the other. When the kids meet up with Thomas (Kai Malina), an apparent concentration camp escapee who also happens to be a volatile and daring young man, his courage attracts her; his possibly being a \u201cdirty Jew\u201d repulses her. He circles the family discreetly but relentlessly, following them through the countryside like both a predator and a protector. But whenever they're in trouble, he steps in and takes charge. There are moments where we're unsure if Lore and Thomas will tear each other's clothes off or eyes out or both. There's a style of filmmaking widely known as \u201cShaky-Cam\u201d which increasingly threatens to cause an audience revolt as the new century rolls on. Shaky-Cam movies deploy handheld cameras to record the events of a screen story in pseudo-documentary style. When done sloppily and incoherently (usually in action films) it earns scholar Matthias Stork's designation, \u201cChaos Cinema. When done with inspiration and control, you get the realist classics of the Dardenne brothers and Ken Loach, the earthy lyricism of new classics like \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild\" (2012) and the Andrea Arnold \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d (2012). Advertisement \u201cLore\u201d belongs in the inspiration-and-control camp. It makes dizzying flourishes out of moments that would pass as filler in other films. A sublime shot of Lore's younger sister skipping rope on a dirt floor sings of their rapidly vanishing youth with such slow-motion grace it aches. (It also evokes Riefenstahl's \"Olympia.\") Very little of this style-to-burn would mean much without actors to give it a pulse. All of the children are living fully in their moments of terror, disillusion and heartbreak. It's slightly disturbing to see such young kids, down to the swaddled infant, put through such an ordeal, but the payoff justifies the torture. Here's the payoff (no, not a plot spoiler): The protagonists are stand-ins for us. Wherever \u201cLore\u201d is apt to screen, most audience members are likely to be citizens of the 27 NATO countries that signed onto America's War on Terror. How many of these folks are as loyal and unquestioning of the war's aims and practices as Lore is of her Fuhrer early on? How many Americans among them believe in extrajudicial killing of fellow citizens \u201csuspected\u201d of ties to terrorism -- and in assassination-by-robot-plane of individuals thought to be linked to Al Qaeda? How many Westerners subscribe to the \u201cbetter there than here\u201d philosophy that has kept thousands of foreign civilian deaths out of our sight? (An international treasure, thenausea.com, was censored off the web a few years ago, due to its raw images and videos of war atrocities that shame governments on every continent.) I'm referring to a specific contemporary situation, but \u201cLore\u201d offers up its lessons for all time. Citizens everywhere are often lost in the fog of their nation's propaganda, until reality comes crashing in. Lore's mental breakdown begins at an exhibit of fresh holocaust photos. The Americans taunt her and her neighbors with stark black & white images of concentration camp bodies piled high. Denial and acceptance push her to the verge of suicide. This can't be real. I don't live in a country that could do this to innocent people.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Dressmaker", "Review": "In the dark of night, a striking figure decked out like a film-noir femme fatale materializes along a road side, toting leather luggage and a Singer sewing machine. She is clearly dressed to impress with her crimson lipstick, white gloves, cocked-just-so chapeau, wavy blonde locks and a black-and-white ensemble that conforms to her womanly shape as if it were her birthday suit. She takes a slow drag on her cigarette and issues this statement of intent that is more of a warning than greeting: \u201cI\u2019m back, you bastards!\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement If that weren\u2019t enough, a car stops and a uniformed constable gets out. He briefly stares before inquiring, \u201cIs that, uh \u2026 Dior?\u201d It's quite an entrance in quite a movie. However, when it comes to \u201cThe\u00a0Dressmaker,\u201d nothing is ever enough. And that is its main problem. Another woman who can rightfully proclaim, \u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d is Australian director and screenwriter Jocelyn Moorhouse. She made a splash in the \u201890s with \u201cProof,\u201d \u201cHow to Make an American Quilt\u201d and \u201cA Thousand Acres,\u201d before taking time off to raise her family. Now,\u00a018 years later, she has adapted a book by Rosalie Ham with a script co-written by hubby P.J. Hogan of \u201cMuriel\u2019s Wedding\u201d fame that is positively exploding with a surfeit of pent-up creative energy that unfortunately doesn\u2019t know when to stop. Not that \u201cThe\u00a0Dressmaker\u201d is ever dull and is even more than occasionally delightful in its nuttiness. This ultimately exhausting tilt-a-whirl of a revenge tale set in 1951 that takes place in the mythical dusty Down Under hamlet of Dungatar embraces all manner of influences\u2014spaghetti Westerns, a Tim Burton-esque aesthetic, a warped world view that rivals John Waters, a small mob of morally corrupt Dickensian-style eccentrics and a story whose wild tonal shifts range from Tex Avery cartoony to Douglas Sirk melodramatic.\u00a0 The lady above is one Myrtle \u201cTilly\u201d Dunnage (Kate Winslet, providing a captivating harbor in this storm of kookiness), who has returned to the community that once banished her as a child. She is ostensibly there to care for her dotty crank of a mother, Mad Molly (a cantankerously cagey Judy Davis, nearly unrecognizable until her character regains her wits and pretty much steals the movie), who has been living in pungent squalor. But Tilly also is clearly out to right some wrongs while shedding a light on a tragic incident from the past that she can\u2019t quite recall. Advertisement All that sounds quite logical, until Tilly, who learned how to\u00a0make\u00a0haute-couture designs while in Paris, hauls out her sewing machine and starts a business doing fashion makeovers for Dungatar\u2019s frumpy female citizenry. This budding Edith Head also has an unusual way of attracting her first customers: She disrupts a rugby match by showing up in a curve-clinging scarlet gown before changing into an even more striking Rita Hayworth-inspired\u00a0black dress\u2014eventually causing the opposing team to lose by simply stripping off its matching jacket. It\u2019s as if \u201cProject Runway\u201d took over the Super Bowl. In the midst of all this, we are rushed through introductions to a raft of quirky characters. Some make an instant impression, such as Hugo Weaving's slyly campy rendition of a cross-dressing police sergeant who can\u2019t help but hungrily caress Tilly\u2019s luxurious fabrics with his eyes (shades of his drag queen in \u201cThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\u201d). Then there is Liam Hemsworth as hunky farmer Teddy, who quite fancies the reluctant Tilly. Until now, I have primarily thought of this actor as Chris Hemsworth\u2019s younger, less talented but equally strapping brother. But working in his native Australia seems to have unleashed a very fetching devil-may-care nonchalance that casts quite a masculine spell. Also, please note that although they are meant to be contemporaries, Winslet\u2019s a luscious 40 years old while Hemsworth is 26\u2014and it doesn\u2019t make a whit of difference. Gender parity at its finest. Naturally, evil also lurks\u00a0in\u00a0Dungatar and it takes several forms, including a hunchback town pharmacist and wife abuser who greets Tilly by hissing, \u201cYour mother\u2019s a slut and you\u2019re a bastard,\u201d the rumor-mongering female schoolteacher whose lies caused Tilly to be forced out of town and the womanizing councilman who torments his clean-freak wife. By the time a rival seamstress strolls into town slinging her own Singer, Moorhouse is clearly guilty of over-accessorizing her already jam-packed fable. Advertisement Still, certain individual scenes are gems and stand out like statement pieces. Davis is at her riotous best when she accompanies Tilly and Teddy on a date to see \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d at a local cinema. Molly\u2019s repulsed reaction to the gorgon-like visage of Gloria Swanson\u2019s aging movie queen is beyond priceless\u2014especially when the\u00a0silent-screen diva\u00a0puts the moves on William Holden\u2019s gigolo of a screenwriter, which leads her to shriek, \u201cShe\u2019s trying to kiss him. RUN!\u201d It is heartening to see Winslet, whose big-screen efforts after her Oscar win for \u201cThe Reader\u201d have been uneven despite her supporting nod last year for \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d get a chance to rip into a juicy lead role. And, for a while, \u201cThe\u00a0Dressmaker\u201d pays off with its out-of-nowhere developments, until it collapses into a pit of death, destruction and despair. I can\u2019t say this is the best film you will see all year, but I can assure you won\u2019t see another one like it again for a long time."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Boy Wonder", "Review": "Here's another movie about a young vigilante hero, like \"Super\" or \"Kick-Ass,\" but darker, more brooding and without the easy payoffs. \"Boy Wonder\" takes itself more seriously and plays more like a psychological thriller about a young man driven to extremes. Any connection between the title and Batman's sidekick is purely ironic. The most essential element is the performance by Caleb Steinmeyer, as Sean, a quiet high school student who was traumatized as a child by witnessing his mother being murdered by a car jacker. He lives in a truce with his father (Bill Sage), a recovering alcoholic, who sometimes beat Sean's mother while the boy was watching. His dad has changed and apologized, but the damage has been done. Advertisement Sean gets straight As in school and is capable, in some scenes, of startling us by the depth of his unexpected knowledge. He is introverted, withdrawn, bottled up. After school, he sneaks away to a shabby boxing gym and works out.  He doesn't become a vigilante because he reads comic books, or for any other facile reason. Although the movie premiered at Chicago's Comic Con, it has no connection with comic books, except probably for writer-director Michael Morrissey's noir lighting and framing, dramatized in the style of dark graphic novels. Because of its marketing, the movie has drawn reviews mostly from the comics-oriented websites, which find it lacking in a comic fan-orientation but don't seem to pick up on the deeper currents. I started watching it with moderate expectations and was surprised by how quickly I was drawn in; the movie works insistently on an emotional level. I don't care how plausible Sean or his actions are; for the length of the film, I was involved in how things would play out. Sean's revenge for his mother's death and father's abuse takes the form of sudden violence against abusive characters he meets while prowling the meaner streets of Manhattan, and even at a teen party (his father is gratified that his loner kid is even going to a party). The pattern is: He sees someone being violently abusive, he challenges the behavior, the other guy attacks him, he absorbs enough pain to demonstrate the other person's savagery, and then he beats him to a pulp or worse. He gets no satisfaction in his victories; there's more the aura of the masochistic performance of duty. Lending this framework a great deal of interest is the story of Sean's interaction with his local police precinct. The cops know of his tragic childhood. They let him hang around the station, looking at mug shots in which he has long since lost hope of finding his mother's killer. A new detective named Teresa, played with warmth and energy by Zulay Henao, takes an interest in him at the same time she begins to investigate the series of vigilante incidents. She and her partner Gary (Daniel Stewart Sherman, quickly likable) discuss him. Slowly, her instincts about Sean suggest something is not quite right. In a genre populated with formulas and dreck, \"Boy Wonder\" is an ambitious exception, well-made, drawing us in. It is particularly notable how Caleb Steinmeyer, a relative newcomer, calmly embodies his character and never cranks Sean up to much. This is a suffering boy, and his actions are more a duty than a satisfaction. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent", "Review": "This documentary directed by Lydia Tenaglia is a conspicuously imperfect movie that turns more compelling after trying your patience, then yields a final half-hour that\u2019s as engrossing as a finely-wrought suspense drama. If you don\u2019t already know who Jeremiah Tower is before seeing it, the opening moments are mystifying: an aging man, handsome and trim, wanders among ruins that seem Latin American (he is in Mexico, we will learn), all alone, and says, in voiceover, \u201cI have to stay away from human beings because somehow I am not one.\u201d Advertisement This is arguably a pretentious thing to say, and for a man who made his name feeding human beings, a very odd one. Jeremiah Tower is a chef who pioneered that thing we call New American Cuisine, and after his introduction, director Tenaglia brings out a Murderer\u2019s Row of food-and-lifestyle figures to hammer home just what a heavy hitter Tower was and is. Martha Stewart, Ruth Reichl, Anthony Bourdain (who is one of the film\u2019s executive producers), Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck and others all sing his praises extravagantly. Terms such as \u201cgame changer\u201d and \u201cpioneer\u201d are thrown around. \u201cI want to thank you for not giving a f**k and going your own way,\u201d a feisty young kitchen dude says at a filmed testimonial for Tower.  Tower\u2019s professional life began at San Francisco\u2019s\u2019 Chez Panisse, whose founder, Alice Waters, is described here by one interviewee as wanting to \u201cgather her rosebuds\u201d while the more inclined-to-elegance Tower was more about putting on the white cuffs and snapping the whisk, or whatever the culinary equivalent of cracking the whip is. How Tower got that way is explained in an account of his early years that sees his affluent parents taking him on ocean voyages and to parties organized by the likes of Cecil Beaton. There is good late \u201840s early \u201850s archival footage\u2014likely due to Tower\u2019s dad being in the film equipment business\u2014but a lot of the material here is in the form of arty staged reenactments, most of which look like outtakes from a \u201cMad Men\u201d dream sequence or something. Combined with the Tower pronouncements of the early part of the movie, the air of stained seriousness grows very thick in the first 30 minutes.  But once Chez Panisse starts taking off in the \u201870s, and the storytelling starts to rely more and more on a proper talking-head Tower interview, interwoven with observations from, among others, the magnificently crusty food writer James Villas, \u201cThe Last Magnificent\u201d becomes undeniably fascinating. Waters and Tower indeed were pioneers, and a lot of the farm-to-table ethos you hear about comes from their insistence in the case of Chez Panisse that locally sourced and/or American ingredients could constitute haute cuisine. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to apologize that we\u2019re using Dungeness crab,\u201d Batali observes. \u201cOur stuff is just as good,\u201d continues Bourdain.  Advertisement As the dual innovations of Tower and Waters are revealed, you\u2019ll be wondering just why Alice Waters herself is not one of the interviewees \u2026 and you\u2019ll find out. You\u2019ll learn more about what feeds Tower\u2019s notions of the impeccable\u2014one of them being a preoccupation with the now almost entirely forgotten journalist/dandy Lucius Beebe. You\u2019ll find out what he\u2019s doing in Mexico at the film\u2019s opening.  The story of Stars, Tower\u2019s own San Francisco restaurant, is similarly juicy. One interviewee compares it to the Velvet Underground in terms of its actual lifespan relative to its massive influence. And then, once we think we\u2019re up to date with Tower, he\u2019s pulled out of his mysterious retirement in late 2014 \u2026 to take over the kitchen at a newly reopened Tavern on the Green.  As Bourdain says, it\u2019s a real \u201cWTF\u201d moment. Tavern, while a New York landmark, was never a bastion of fine dining, and given its capaciousness, it seems logistically unlikely that it could be. I got the impression that the film was expressly commissioned to chronicle Tower\u2019s comeback in this peculiar setting, and for the final section of the movie, Tenaglia and her crew are the flies on the wall as Tower\u2019s immovable standards collide with co-owner Jim Caiola\u2019s irresistible rights of proprietorship.  New Yorkers know how it came out. If you don\u2019t, the scenes of Tower walking around Central Park in the dead of winter as his observations concerning a \u201chorror of mediocrity\u201d and an \u201cabyss of slop\u201d may qualify as foreshadowing. It is in this section, too, that Tenaglia reveals certain stories about Stars and its demise that might be perceived as her burying a couple of ledes. By this time, though, one is invested enough in the story that the annoyance is minor. Had the picture been more coherently organized, its appeal might be broader. As it is, gourmands (not \u201cfoodies\u201d\u2014that word never comes up here, and if it did, I suspect Tower might rightly condemn it as the sort of vulgarity he complains of being surrounded by) will avidly consume this very American story, the chaotic milieu of which is almost literally a world removed from the meditative one of a film like \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi.\" Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Zombieland", "Review": "There's no getting around it: Zombies are funny. I think they stopped being scary for me along toward the end of \"Night of the Living Dead.\" OK, maybe in a few others, like \"28 Days Later.\" They're the Energizer Bunnies of corpses, existing primarily to be splattered. But who would have guessed such a funny movie as \"Zombieland\" could be made around zombies? No thanks to the zombies. The movie is narrated by a guy played by Jesse Eisenberg, named after his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, who is making his way back home across a zombie-infested America. The landscape is strewn with burned-out cars and dead bodies. He encounters another non-zombie survivor, Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). The two team up, not without many disagreements, and eventually find two healthy women: the sexy Wichita (Emma Stone) and her little sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). Advertisement The plot comes down to a road movie threatened by the Undead, as countless zombies are shot, mashed, sledgehammered and otherwise inconvenienced. Wichita and Little Rock turn out to be con women, dashing the hopes of the love-struck Columbus. Yet eventually they all join in an odyssey to a Los Angeles amusement park, for no better reason than that there's no location like a carnival for a horror movie. Yes, even with a haunted house, the usual ominous calliope music and a zombie clown. Columbus, like so many others, is phobic about clowns, making Eisenberg an ingrate, since his mother put him through grade school by playing clowns at children's parties. All of this could have been dreary, but not here. The filmmakers show invention and well-tuned comic timing, and above all, there's a cameo by Bill Murray that gets the single biggest laugh I've heard this year. The foursome hauls up at Murray's vast Beverly Hills mansion, so palatial it is surely a grand hotel, and finds him still in residence. More than that I will not say, except that not many zombie comedies can make me think simultaneously about \"Psycho\" and \"Garfield.\" Eisenberg, a good actor, plays a pleasant nerd who has compiled a seemingly endless survival list for the United States of Zombies. These items are displayed in onscreen graphics that pop up for laughs and include a tribute to the Back Seat Rule of my Little Movie Glossary, which instructs us -- but I'm sure you remember. Woody Harrelson takes a great deal of relish in killing zombies, often declining to use a gun because he prefers killing them with car doors, tire irons and whatever else comes to hand. As usual, the zombies are witless, lumbering oafs who dutifully line up to be slaughtered.  Vampires make a certain amount of sense to me, but zombies not so much. What's their purpose? Why do they always look so bad? Can there be a zombie with good skin? How can they be smart enough to determine that you're food and so dumb they don't perceive you're about to blast them? I ask these questions only because I need a few more words for this review. I will close by observing that Bill Murray is the first comedian since Jack Benny who can get a laugh simply by standing there. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Stray Dog", "Review": "When he came home to the United States after his second tour in Vietnam, Ronnie \"Stray Dog\" Hall discovered that he wasn't wanted here, so he did an 11-year tour in Korea, where he was shocked to discover that everyone liked him. He started a family and returned to the U.S. After some years, he left his wife, married another woman and now realizes that he's bored with the United States. His reasons are understandable: becoming accustomed to travel, experiencing different cultures and having to put up with those damn politicians, man. Advertisement \"Stray Dog,\" the first foray into documentary filmmaking for director Debra Granik, follows Hall in his day-to-day life. The film begins as if at the end of an ellipsis and ends with one, too. We learn what shaped him through the course of the film, and by the end, we imagine that he's going to have to make a few more adjustments\u2014that some of his plans are going to be put on hold indefinitely. Hall is a stubborn man but not in an authoritarian way. He tries to explain what being a parent will be like to his granddaughter\u2014how she'll have to shape and mold her child, how he doesn't want to see her living off welfare, how she has to remember that, while she may not be important to the world at large, she will be of the utmost importance to her son. We get a glimpse of the stern but caring authority figure in Hall's scenes with her, but then she asks if he'll build a rocking horse for his great-grandson. Granik doesn't show Hall's face, because it's not part of the one-camera coverage in the scene, but she does capture the audio of his response with utter clarity. The man melts. There's no other way to describe the tone of his voice when he says he will. We can hear the pride, the humility and, above all else, the love. There are always a few questions in the back of one's mind while watching a documentary of this style, whether one wants to call it v\u00e9rit\u00e9 or Direct Cinema, in which the camera is present as the subjects go about their everyday lives without acknowledging the camera's presence. One question, of course, is how much the mere presence of the camera affects how the subjects behave. Another is whether or not the filmmakers prod their subjects to elicit a certain response, and yet another is to what degree the footage is shaped in the editing process. All of these questions boil down to the most important one: Is the film honest? Hall's response to his granddaughter's question about the rocking horse pretty much answers that question in the affirmative. If she had wanted to, Granik could have found a way for us to see his reaction, but she doesn't. She knows not only that it would be \"cheating\" but also that it's unnecessary. That was Hall's reaction in that moment, and that is the way she and her crew captured it. The scene is affecting because we know it's authentic, and we know it's authentic because of what Granik doesn't do. Advertisement There are no voice-overs in the film. No one sits and talks to the camera. There are no reenactments of Hall's past. Granik watches this man, listens to him and others as they talk about what's happening and what has happened, and trusts that these moments of routine will tell us everything we need to know. We learn more than enough about Hall over the course of the film, and all of it points to a decent, good-hearted man who has overcome a lot of pain and torment but still knows that there are demons he will never defeat. We see him talking with his psychiatrist, as he recalls how he was a young guy\u2014\"too young,\" he says\u2014in a leadership position in Vietnam. He did things for which he will never forgive himself. He lost friends in battle. Upon returning home, Hall was angry at himself and the world for being in a war that he doesn't think was necessary, but he knows that anger is a waste of time. He tries to explain that to other veterans as he rides his motorcycle\u2014along with a parade of other vets\u2014from his home in southern Missouri to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The veterans of more recent conflicts know all about post-traumatic stress disorder, but he and other veterans of his generation didn't. He spends a lot of time at memorials and funerals. We see him with his second wife Alicia, an immigrant from Mexico whose two sons are still living there. She wants her sons to come to the U.S. (When they do, the film shifts focus to the family adjusting to the arrangement and loses some of its potency). Hall has dreams of retiring in Mexico. He runs an RV park and is quite lenient on the tenants' rent payments. Most of them are veterans, too, and struggling. One of Hall's buddies has to decide between paying to have his back teeth pulled or to get dentures. He goes with the latter option and gets to work with a string to solve the first problem. Advertisement The film takes a hard, firsthand look at the failings of government toward those who have fought for the United States, but it finds abundant hope in veterans like Hall and the community that they've formed. He and his friends guide a woman who lost her daughter and grandson in two different conflicts toward a support group, and when her water heater leaks, they replace her floor. \"Stray Dog\" largely succeeds because Granik's technique complements her subject. Both he and the film are modest in their goals and cherish the value of honesty."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Mongol", "Review": "Mongols need laws. I will make them obey -- even if I have to kill half of them.  --Genghis Khan Sergei Bodrov's \"Mongol\" is a ferocious film, blood-soaked, pausing occasionally for passionate romance and more frequently for torture. As a visual spectacle, it is all but overwhelming, putting to shame some of the recent historical epics from Hollywood. If it has a flaw, and it does, it is expressed succinctly by the wife of its hero: \"All Mongols do is kill and steal.\" She must have seen the movie. That's about all they do in \"Mongol.\" They do not sing, dance, chant, hold summit meetings, have courts, hunt, or (with one exception) even cook and eat. They have no culture, except for a series of sayings: \"A Mongol does, or does not ...\" a long list of things, although many a Mongol seems never to have been issued the list, and does (or does not) do them, anyway. Advertisement As a result, the film consists of one bloody scene of carnage after another, illustrated by hordes of warriors eviscerating one another while bright patches of blood burst upon the screen. At the center of the killing is invariably the khan, or leader, named Temudgin (Tadanobu Asano), who is not yet Genghis Khan, but be patient: This film is the first of a trilogy. The film opens with Temudgin at age 9 (Odnyam Odsuren), taken by his father to choose a bride from the Merkit clan. This will settle an old score. But along the way they happen upon a smaller clan, and there Temudgin first sets eyes on 10-year-old Borte (Bavertsetseg Erdenebat), who informs him he should choose her as his bride. He agrees, and thus is forged a partnership that will save his life more than once. Years pass, the two are married, and Borte (played as an adult by Khulan Chuluun) makes a perfect bride, but one hard to keep. She is kidnapped by another clan, bears the first of two children claimed by Temudgin despite reasons to doubt, and follows her man into a series of battles that stain the soil of Mongolia with gallons of blood. It happens that I have seen another movie about Mongols that suggests they do more than steal and kill. This is the famous nine-hour, three-part documentary \"Taiga\" (1995) by Ulrike Ottinger, who lived with today's yurt dwellers, witnessed one of their trance-evoking religious ceremonies, observed their customs and traditions, and learned in great detail how they procure and prepare food. There is also a wrestling match that is a good deal more cheerful than the contests in \"Mongol.\" But you do not have the time for a nine-hour documentary on this subject, I suppose, nor does \"Mongol.\" The nuances of an ancient and ingeniously developed culture are passed over, and it cannot be denied that \"Mongol\" is relentlessly entertaining as an action picture. It left me, however, with some questions. Many involve the survival of the young Temudgin. Having inherited all his father's enemies, he is captured more than once, and we actually see him being fed so he can grow tall enough to kill (\"Mongols do not kill children\"). His neck and hands are imprisoned in a heavy wooden yoke, and when he escapes, he has the energy to run for miles across the steppe. On another occasion, he falls through the ice of a lake, and the movie simply ignores the question of how he is saved, unless it is by Tengri, God of the Blue Sky. Yes, I think it was Tengri, who also appears as a wolf and saves him more than once. If you want to be Genghis Khan, it helps to have a god in your corner. Advertisement Finally, Temudgin is imprisoned in a cell surrounded by a moat populated by savage dogs. No such arrangement can hold him, of course, and he leads his clan into yet another series of battles, as gradually it occurs to him that this is no way to live, and the Mongols need to be united under a strong leader who will enforce less anarchistic battle practices. It's at about that point the movie ends, and we reflect that Temudgin has to survive two more such films to become Genghis Khan. And we think our election campaigns run on too long."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Stratton", "Review": "This movie opens with a bunch of texts extolling the badassery of the \u201cSpecial Boat Service,\u201d a branch of Britain\u2019s Royal Navy. The text has a certain needling quality; were it to have wound up saying \u201cTrust us, it\u2019s really badass,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be a bit surprised. We see the problem here. Unlike \u201cNavy SEALS,\u201d which has an intriguing ring to it right off the bat, \u201cSpecial Boat Service\u201d sounds like something you\u2019d call if you need a particularly swanky water taxi. \u201cStratton,\u201d then, is titled for a particularly badass member of Special Boat Service. It is based on a book by Duncan Falconer, which yes, is a pen name,\u00a0apparently, for a person who was once in the Special Boat Service and has written one non-fiction book about it and a bunch of Stratton novels about it. This movie is directed by Simon West, who as many people are fond of recalling, also directed \u201cCon Air,\u201d the 1997 action thriller that has accrued something resembling classic status over the past two decades. Apparently \u201cCon Air\u201d is enough to get some people\u2019s hopes up every time a new film directed by Simon West comes around. This wannabe franchise opener does not fulfill any hope, however. Advertisement After explaining Special Boat Service, the movie chronicles Dominic Cooper\u2019s Stratton on a mission in the Persian Gulf, particularly Iran\u2019s Strait of Hormuz. The bearded operative is joined by American partner Marty, stealthily raiding a chemical weapons plant while their remote support team keeps track of them. I don\u2019t watch the television series \u201cScorpion\u201d regularly, honest I don\u2019t, but this opener feels like an episode of that show with the \u201cwacky\u201d characters excised. That is, a tense woman in front of a computer (Gemma Chan) instructs Stratton and Marty as the \u201ctension\u201d mounts and the inevitable cry of \u201cWe have no choice! Just send in the chopper!\u201d is sounded.    Back home on his lonesome, Stratton licks his wounds on his houseboat, from which his now ex-girlfriend has disembarked. No worries: he has an eccentric hard-drinking neighbor (Derek Jacobi) on a neighboring boat. I think these guys are standard issue for British intelligence agents. Back at the office, Stratton reports to female boss Sumner, whose authority is immediately undercut for the viewer on account of her being portrayed on an elliptical exercise machine when Stratton walks in. There\u2019s all sorts of bad news. The guy who led an armed attack on Stratton and the now-absent Marty is a long-thought-dead Russian operative with whom Sumner (poor Connie Nielsen) was once romantically involved. Also, there\u2019s a mole in the SBS offices, whose identity you\u2019ll guess as soon as the actor who plays him walks into a frame. And there\u2019s a terrorist attack in the offing. Target: they don\u2019t know yet. Oh, wait, a little while later they find out. Oh, no. It\u2019s London.    This really is a paint-by-numbers action movie with two good things going for it. Those are brevity\u2014it\u2019s only 93 minutes long\u2014and immediate forgetability. This latter quality, I allow, is only considered good by a certain class of people, those who feel overly beleaguered. Given that this is a movie reaching our screens in a time when people are just plain tired, and perhaps dreading the travails of the year ahead, an aggressively unimposing movie such as this might not be the worst time-waster. But it\u2019s still a time-waster.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Garbo the Spy", "Review": "What has hardly been known is how the Nazis were deluded. It was largely the work of a single man, Juan Pujol Garcia, a Spaniard who fed the Nazis a stream of misleading information from a spy network that existed entirely in his imagination.  Edmon Roch's \"Garbo the Spy\" is an engrossing documentary that is itself largely a work of the director's imagination. Garcia was code-named \"Garbo\" because one of his handlers considered him \"the greatest actor in the world.\" Impersonating a man who controlled sources that never existed, he sold the Nazis so convincingly that when he decided one of his spies had to die, the Nazis paid his \"widow\" a pension. Advertisement Based partly on Nigel West's book Operation Garbo: The Personal Story of the Most Successful Spy of World War II, the doc tells the story of an elusive young man from Barcelona who wanted an effect on the war and volunteered his services not once but four times to the British. They eventually accepted him after he had already set up as a free-lancer, feeding his own Nazis contacts information from his fictional network. Moving to Lisbon, a hotbed of intrigue in Nazi-occupied Europe, he made up most of the information passed on by his \"network,\" and enough of it was true that the Nazis believed him. Over one period of nine months, he even convinced them he was in London. His masterwork was to inform them that the Allies would fake a landing at Normandy to lure the German army there, and then unleash Patton's surprise attack at Calais. They believed him. The fiction worked so well that the Nazis never were up to strength at Normandy, and the fabled Panzer division, while en route there, was diverted to Calais instead.  By this point, the Allies were working closely with Garcia. Three hours before the D-Day attack was timed to begin, Eisenhower personally authorized Garcia to tip off the Nazis, reckoning they wouldn't have time for troop movements. In a stroke of luck, when Garcia's message arrived, the Nazi communications center was unstaffed, and so when they discovered his timely warning hours later, he looked even more reliable. Incredibly, weeks after the invasion, he continued to convince them the real target was elsewhere. When they asked why the attack at Calais never came, he explained: \"They had such unexpected success at Normandy, they decided to cancel it.\" The Nazis continued to believe Garcia to the end, and he became the only man decorated by both sides in World War II. Only two early photographs of Garcia exist. \"Garbo the Spy,\" perhaps inspired by its subject, is made up partly of smoke and mirrors. Director Edmon Roch uses vintage newsreel footage and scenes from old spy movies to illustrate his story, narrated by a series of talking heads, including Nigel West himself. Some of the footage shows Alec Guinness in \"Our Man in Havana\" (1959), a movie based on a Graham Greene novel inspired by Garcia. West was able to trace Garcia's postwar movements to the Portuguese colony of Angola, where he reportedly died in 1949. Not so. He slipped away to Venezuela, operated a movie theater, married and had children. The film concludes with an enormously affecting series of scenes in which the elderly Garcia revisits the beaches of Normandy and an Allied cemetery. Perhaps fittingly, he never speaks.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "A Futile & Stupid Gesture", "Review": "The good men and women of the National Lampoon changed comedy forever. The impact of their magazine and movies like \u201cAnimal House\u201d and \u201cCaddyshack\u201d can undeniably be felt in almost all modern comedy, but certainly in the quirky style of writer/actor/director David Wain. One of the members of \u201cThe State\u201d and the team behind \u201cWet Hot American Summer,\u201d Wain has always operated under the \u201ccomedy ensemble\u201d concept of filmmaking and TV, bringing together the same performers over and over again, often skewering expectations of the genre, as in his spoof of rom-coms, the underrated \u201cThey Came Together.\u201d Could he be too good a fit for the story of National Lampoon? Does this explain why \u201cA Futile & Stupid Gesture,\u201d while being full of likable and funny people isn\u2019t all that funny or likable? Because it's too much like telling your own story?\u00a0While there\u2019s a bit of hero worship going on that deflates the piece, and Wain\u2019s direction is surprisingly uninspired, the biggest problem is the script that tries to cover too much ground but doesn\u2019t really have that much to say as it does so. Advertisement There\u2019s a scene in this film about the rise of National Lampoon that sums it up in ways that writers John Aboud and Michael Colton certainly didn\u2019t intend. The writers are sitting around throwing out ideas when Tony Hendra (Matt Lucas) drops a dull idea\u2014drawing Nixon with Pinocchio\u2019s nose. For some reason, this bad joke that nearly got Hendra run out of the room kept coming back to me. Just as it\u2019s an obvious way to convey a message\u2014Nixon is a liar\u2014too much of \u201cA Futile & Stupid Gesture\u201d takes a similarly predictable route to gets its history across. The story of Doug Kenney and the ascendance of National Lampoon is told primarily through narration and montage. It\u2019s a Greatest Hits collection, hitting the beats that anyone who saw \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead\u201d already knows, and doing so incredibly superficially. The best thing about Wain\u2019s film is the casting, including one brilliant piece of meta analysis, but that only gets a movie so far.    Will Forte plays Kenney, who took the Harvard Lampoon that they helped through one of its most successful phases and turned it into an international phenomenon with his best buddy, Henry Beard (Domhnall Gleeson, giving the most grounded and interesting performance in the film despite an awful wig.) When they get to New York and found the magazine, the film rushes through a decade or so of history from the first days of groundbreaking comedy through the movies and up to Kenney\u2019s death in 1980. We meet tons of the major comedians from the era including Gilda Radner (Jackie Tohn), Bill Murray (Jon Daly), John Landis (Brian Huskey), John Belushi (John Gemberling), Christopher Guest (Seth Green), and the one and only Chevy Chase, played by his \u201cCommunity\u201d co-star Joel McHale, with whom he had a notoriously contentious on-set relationship. Imagine playing one of your least favorite co-workers in a film. McHale doesn\u2019t go for parody, nailing Chase\u2019s rhythms and comedic timing, although it\u2019s telling that Chase is portrayed here is something of an enabler for his best buddy when it comes to drugs.    Martin Mull plays an older version of Doug Kenney, which is itself a slightly crazy framing choice given that Kenney died when he was 36. So is Mull playing Kenney from the afterlife? The truth is that it\u2019s a lazy narrative choice, allowing Kenney to comment on his own story from afar, although it would have been just as effective to have Forte do these fourth-wall breaks. It\u2019s almost like someone just wanted to get Mull in the movie and the other parts were taken. The emphasis on Kenney is particularly frustrating narratively in that this is way more his story than that of Lampoon. Of course, Kenney is a breakthrough voice in comedy, but there\u2019s a more balanced version of this story that\u2019s way more interesting.    Advertisement Worst of all, \u201cA Futile and Stupid Gesture\u201d can\u2019t keep its irreverent, NL-inspired tone throughout, and Wain can\u2019t quite handle the serious stuff\u2014one gets the impression he\u2019d much rather be hanging out in the writer\u2019s room or behind-the-scenes of the radio show than dealing with Kenney\u2019s drug addiction and infidelities. The superficial reimagining of comedy highlights is kinda fun in a \u201cThe Chris Farley Show\u201d kind of way (\u201cRemember that food fight? That was awesome.\u201d) but that tone definitely doesn\u2019t work when the film has to be even remotely serious. At one point, Kenney says \u201cComedy doesn\u2019t have to be pretty. It should be fucking raw.\u201d In the way it handles both comedy and misery, I wish this movie was too."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Little Men", "Review": "Ira Sachs' 2014 film \"Love Is Strange\" told the story of a longtime couple (played by John Lithgow and Alfred Molina) forced to live apart because of the reality of New York's real estate market. The film was devastating in its emotional impact. \"Little Men,\" Sachs' follow-up, tells the story of two families, living and working on one block in Brooklyn, and has the same fraught background of relationships and real estate. The script, co-written by Sachs and Mauricio Zacharias, does not stack the deck one way or the other. Looking at the situation in \"Little Men\" is like looking through a prism: what you perceive depends on the angle. It is reminiscent of Asghar Farhadi's \"A Separation,\" a similar story of the clash of two families from different backgrounds and classes. \"Little Men\" doesn't reach the humanist tragedy of \"Love Is Strange,\" but that's an unfair comparison since very few films achieve what \"Love Is Strange\" does. \"Little Men\" is extremely powerful in its own right, with its devotion to its characters' differing perspectives so refreshing in an increasingly black-and-white world. Advertisement When Brian (Greg Kinnear) inherits his dead father's Brooklyn brownstone, it is a step up for him and his family. Brian is an actor who doesn't make much money, and his wife Kathy (Jennifer Ehle) is the breadwinner. But even she doesn't make enough to purchase a brownstone. Their 13-year-old son Jake (Theo Taplitz) is a quiet, artistic boy who has a hard time making friends. All of that changes when they move into the brownstone. On the ground floor is a dress-making shop, there for decades, run by Leonor (Paulina Garcia). Brian's father had liked Leonor, and gave her a break on the rent, allowing her to stay even as the neighborhood gentrified around them. Brian's sister (Talia Balsam) thinks Leonor should be evicted to make way for a more profitable tenant but Brian hopes for a compromise. He attempts to open up a conversation with Leonor about altering the agreement she had with his father. To say this does not go well is an understatement. \"Little Men\" is only 85 minutes long, and its brevity works in its favor. The mood is compressed and urgent. Leonor's 13-year-old son Tony (Michael Barbieri) is a gregarious, friendly kid, and he and Jake strike up an unlikely friendship. They have a lot in common, mainly their ambition for their futures. Jake is serious about being an artist, and Tony wants to be an actor. They roam the streets, Jake wobbling on roller-blades, Tony zipping along on a kick scooter, Brooklyn passing in a blur, music surging up around them. (These shots repeat. They are explosions of wordless emotion.)\u00a0 In the adult world, however, things go south fast. Brian finds Leonor not only intractable, but openly unfriendly. Leonor goes against every unexamined assumption about \"class\" that Brian probably didn't even know he had. He doesn't say this, but it is clear he expected her to be grateful that she got a break in rent for as long as she did. Leonor is not grateful, not deferential to his supposed higher status. She sucks down smoke from her cigarettes like a fuming dragon. She's not afraid to go for the jugular. As the war intensifies between the parents, the boys find themselves caught in the middle. Advertisement \"Little Men\" has a melodramatic set-up out of 1930s agitprop theatre (landlords vs. tenants). Melodrama for some reason has a bad reputation, seeming to suggest soap operas or three-hanky weepers, but melodrama has always been one of the most effective genres for social and economic criticism because down on the ground things really are that important. There is nothing melodramatic about losing one's home and livelihood. It's life and death to the people involved. Sachs' approach to melodrama is human-sized and almost casual, one of his greatest gifts as a director. His shots are careful but not over-determined or showy. He is interested in the rhythms of everyday life and how those rhythms are disrupted when events accelerate. Greg Kinnear is superb as a man torn in many different directions, the most secret one being his disappointment at how his life has turned out, and his conflicting emotions when confronted with the artistic ambitions of his young son. His frustration at Leonor's attitude shows the residues of entitlement that have helped form and warp his personality. Brian is ashamed that his wife supports him financially, but it's something he can't allow himself to say out loud.\u00a0 The two young actors playing Jake and Tony are so natural that it feels like they strolled in off the street and started improvising. \"Little Men\" does not condescend to ambitious serious children. Tony takes an acting class in what appears to be the Meisner technique, and seeing him in action during a repetition exercise (a great scene) is important because it shows Tony's desires are not theoretical. He wants it. Tony is fearless; Tony is easily intimate with other people; Tony is open.\u00a0 Paulina Garc\u00eda gives one of the best performances of the year as Leonor. To Greg and Kathy she is a maddening witch-like creature, but that's only because they look through the prism at their own angle. Garc\u00eda keeps her performance controlled, with surging explosions of rage and contempt churning beneath the surface. She's terrifying. She's terrified. When she crushes her cigarette out on the sidewalk, you can picture Brian and Kathy's faces underneath her shoe. She is not a villain. She is fighting for her life. Advertisement Native New Yorkers watch a lot of films and television shows set in Manhattan and think, \"The apartments are too big. The hallways are too wide. I had to cut my bedframe in half in order to get it up the stairs.\" Sachs does not have a tourist's mentality towards the city. The apartments are cluttered and cramped, people are on top of each other in any given space. New York is (increasingly) just for the rich, with entire neighborhoods driven out of existence by rising costs. When a city forgets or ignores its own past, what else is lost in the process? Loss is the air that \"Little Men\" breathes. At the end of Stephen King's \"It,\" narrator Bill Denbrough muses: \"He thinks that it is good to be a child, but it is also good to be a grown-up and able to consider the mystery of childhood ... its beliefs and desires ... it's nice ... to think that childhood has its own sweet secrets and confirms mortality, and that mortality defines all courage and love.\" The friendship of Jake and Tony in \"Little Men\" carries that kind of bittersweet weight. Jake and Tony hold hands over the growing abyss between their parents. They're only 13 years old. Do they know that relationships are fragile and need protection? Do they understand how precious their friendship is, how much they need to hold onto it, how much they will miss it if it ends? These questions carry intense reverberation long after the film ends."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Kumare", "Review": "A documentary featuring Vikram Gandhi, Purva Bedi and Kristin Calgaro. Growing up in New Jersey, Vikram Gandhi was a typical American kid who resented the way his family tried to enforce Hindu beliefs and practices. He found it ironic that Americans began to popularize gurus and yoga just at the time he was growing away from such things. On a trip to India, he says, he found that \"real\" gurus were no more real than the American frauds who copied them.  That led him into the deliberate deception that he filmed in \"Kumare.\" He grew a long beard and a pony-tail, exchanged his shoes for sandals, switched his slacks and suits to flowing orange robes, and started carrying an ornate walking stick. Then he moved to Arizona, hired an expert to teach him yoga and a PR woman to promote him as a guru, and began to attract followers in meetings at shopping malls, community centers and around the swimming pools of his affluent clients. His accent was modeled on the way his grandmother spoke English. His teachings were deliberate gibberish: talk of inner blue lights, \"finding the guru within,\" and chants of fabricated mantras. Advertisement At this point in the film, it takes an odd turn. Kumare's followers believe him without question. They share their deepest secrets with him and visibly appear to benefit from him. These people are not dummies. Mostly middle-aged, they take their health seriously, are somewhat skilled at yoga and follow schedules of meditation. \"Kumare\" seems to establish that a guru can be a complete fraud and nevertheless do a certain amount of good, because what matters is not the sincerity of the guru but that of his followers. Gandhi seems typecast for the role of Kumare. Tall, thin, bending forward to listen better, he speaks warmly and encouragingly, and makes deep eye contact. He smiles easily. He never pushes too far. He seems as real as any guru and more real than some. His teaching of yoga seems within the ability of his followers to accomplish. He narrates the documentary (in an ordinary American voice), introduces us to followers he's grown close to, and begins to believe he may have started something that was out of his control. He tells his followers the time has come for him to leave them. Now they are on their own. He returns to New Jersey, cuts his hair, shaves his beard, and begins to practice a speech in the mirror: \"I am not who you think I am.\" Whether he ever says this, and how the movie ends, I will leave for you to discover.  It seems to me that \"Kumare\" reflects a truth that is often expressed in three words: \"Act as if.\" If you can act as if something is true, in a sense that makes it true. It doesn't matter if a teacher's spiritual teachings have any basis. It doesn't matter if the supernatural even exists (Gandhi believes it does not). His followers benefit by acting \"as if.\" When I first heard this film described, I assumed it would be a satirical, snarky comedy like Sacha Baron Cohen's \"Borat.\" Not so. Gandhi seems to be essentially a good man, and he learns things of value to himself in his experiment. In a sense, the deception he practices on his followers is contemptible, but in another sense, they're all in it together. The film's implication seems to be: It doesn't matter if a religion's teachings are true. What matters is if you think they are. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles", "Review": "\u201cYou should always have something [to fall back on]. Me,\r\nI\u2019ve got magic!\u201d John Candy, doing a slightly pointed sendup of Orson Welles,\r\nmade that joke in a great SCTV sketch in 1982. The real-life Welles regularly\r\nsawed Marlene Dietrich in half to entertain the troops during World War II, and\r\nplayed magicians\u2014or illusionists\u2014in films. His final completed feature, \u201cF For\r\nFake,\u201d opens with him doing a little hand magic, before concocting a remarkable\r\nillusion in the form of an essay film for 90 minutes.  Advertisement \u201cThe magician is an actor,\u201d Welles himself is heard\r\nreflecting at the opening of this entertaining documentary directed by Chuck\r\nWorkman, the master montage-maker whose work is a consistent highlight of the\r\nAcademy Awards ceremonies every year. \u201cMagician\u201d is hardly a definitive account\r\nof the inordinately complex actor and creator that was Welles\u2014at a mere 94\r\nminutes, it could more accurately be deemed the tip of an iceberg\u2014but it offers\r\na not-bad education for folks who aren\u2019t as familiar with the man and his work\r\nas they ought to be, and a few not insubstantial satisfactions for folks like\r\nmyself, who agree with Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s assessment of the man and his work:\r\n\u201cAll of us will always owe him everything.\u201d  For one thing, Workman\u2019s film tells a different story from\r\nthat of showbiz conventional wisdom. That is that the always precocious Welles\r\n(\u201cthere\u2019s nothing more hateful,\u201d he chucklingly admits, than the kind of\r\nprodigy he was at the age of ten) was a wunderkind who peaked with his first\r\ncommercial film (that\u2019s 1941\u2019s \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d still a ripping yarn, poignant\r\nreflection, and galvanic primer of cinema language) and descended into a career\r\npurgatory of his own profligate making shortly thereafter. No, throughout its\r\ndepiction of what it divides up as four phases of Welles\u2019 life, Workman\u2019s movie\r\nnever stops depicting Welles as an artist: a restless, searching, often\r\nfrustrated and sometimes frustrating artist, one who never stopped working but\r\nwho worked in a fashion completely incomprehensible to the conventional wisdom\r\nof the cinema industry.\u00a0 One interviewee points out that film is the only art\r\nform in which it\u2019s considered eccentric, if not wasteful, to have left behind\r\nas large a body of unfinished work as Welles did. Of course the fact that there\r\nis so much unfinished work isn\u2019t quite so bothersome as that it\u2019s so hard to\r\nsee, and the film seems almost weary in its final quarter as it has to make\r\ncaveats concerning the unavailability of so much of Welles' work. Take \u201cFalstaff,\u201d\r\na.k.a. \u201cChimes At Midnight.\u201d This wonderful 1966 Shakespeare hybrid is\r\nconfidently proclaimed by actor, director and Welles biographer Simon Callow as\r\n\u201cfinally, Welles\u2019 masterpiece\u201d (a piece of purposefully provocative\r\nquasi-heresy, given the likes of \u201cKane,\u201d the compromised \u201cThe Magnificent\r\nAmbersons,\u201d and the magnificent, and largely uncompromised, \u201cThe Trial\u201d), but\r\nafter the few minutes devoted to it the viewer is informed that it\u2019s tied up in\r\nlegal battles. There\u2019s a sense here that Workman\u2019s film, coming as it does a\r\nlittle prior to the centenary of Welles\u2019 birth, and a possible construction and\r\nrelease of Welles\u2019 last fully shot but largely unedited project \u201cThe Other Side\r\nof The Wind,\u201d has something of an activist agenda: look at the works of this\r\namazing film and theater director, scattered in disarray over the four corners\r\nof the globe, Workman seems to be saying. Can\u2019t we do better?  Advertisement Film lovers of every generation have to hope we can, and do.\r\nIn the meantime, while this film elides a lot and makes a questionable choice\r\nor two in its portrayals of Welles\u2019 outsize personality (I like Wolfgang Puck\u2019s\r\ncooking as much as the next person who\u2019s been to Spago, but I\u2019m not sure his\r\ncomments on Welles\u2019 epicure side were entirely necessary here), it goes to most\r\nof the right people when it comes to shattering the myth of Welles the\r\nHollywood flameout: critic/historians Jonathan Rosenbaum and Joseph McBride\r\nchime in with apt observations, and Welles\u2019 longtime companion Oja Kodar is\r\nenergetic and vibrant and even rather charmingly eccentric. Whatever its\r\nshortcomings, \u201cMagician\u201d accomplishes quite a bit as a corrective, and it also\r\ngives one an hour and a half in the company of Orson Welles. That in and of\r\nitself is worth at least a three-star rating."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Of Men and War", "Review": "Making its national premiere on PBS tonight after first playing the Cannes Film Festival in 2014, \"Of Men and War\" provides a different perspective of PTSD than we often see from American stories about war. Directed by Laurent B\u00e9cue-Renard, who dedicates the film to the WWI experiences of his grandfathers, \"Of Men and War\" is not the type of Iraq soldier film one may expect. It does present intricate experiences of PTSD, but does so with distance.\u00a0 Our entry point to their lives is their trauma, the way they share their own stories behind sunglasses and brand name clothing, or how we simply listen to them in a quiet conference room with a few fellow Iraq veterans. They're introduced without names or a background about their homelands or specific operations; we know more about how they got to veteran home Pathway more than anything else. These men are then bonded by their traumatic experiences with death\u2014causing it or witnessing it. Their body language is as revealing, as those listening sit, stunned.\u00a0 Advertisement B\u00e9cue-Rernard goes for an ultimate realism when collecting these stories, his camera just one of many gazes in the room during these scenes. His framing is not claustrophobic, and any discomfort the soldiers may have in sharing their stories doesn't seem to come from the idea that they're being filmed. Poignantly, when the sessions end, the veterans get up and walk out, our gaze staying inside the conference room. We very rarely hear what they talk about on their smoke breaks.\u00a0 Through the subject matter of their monologues and various footage from them in the outside world, a few common thematic threads emerge. Family is one key entity, in how these veterans deal with their PTSD while at home resuming as normal a life as possible, one man completely silent while his girlfriend tries to keep him mentally present, talking about a new home and starting a family. With some of its lighter moments, \"Of Men and War\" keeps us in check on the highs and lows with its editing, as when footage of a wedding is followed up immediately with another veteran talking about killing himself.\u00a0 But though he strives for as natural a depiction of trauma as possible, B\u00e9cue-Renard can prove to have a slightly heavy hand with the smallest details, which can be too much for such a delicate topic. The editing often runs close to speaking for its subjects, like when reaction shots of veterans reacting to minor stresses (screaming babies, Christmas carol music stopping) end abruptly. Even the music feels wildly out of place, with swirling woodwinds seemingly pulled out of a 1960s Georges Delerue score. \u00a0 Fascinated to a limit by the image of trauma, the movie lacks a full vision. Even in the third act, when arcs start to be fortified regarding the veterans' past, present and future, the emotional effect is cold. By withholding information for so long and generalizing them as recurring faces in a room, its different representations of trauma are mixed together in one stew, even though we're talking about extremely specific, life-changing experiences. B\u00e9cue-Renard brings his own brutality to the topic, one that isn't needed in a movie about PTSD, by putting us at odds with feeling his subjects' pain, or only studying it.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Miss Meadows", "Review": "The opening scene of \u201cMiss Meadows\u201d sets a peculiar, and\r\npeculiarly labored, tone. Katie Holmes, in a very proper anachronistic\r\nensemble, walks down a sidewalk in a beautifully manicured suburb. She reads\r\nfrom a poetry anthology and occasionally breaks into a tap dance. A CGI\r\nsquirrel raises an eyebrow, a CGI bluebird chirps. It\u2019s all very\r\nopening-scene-of-\u201cBlue Velvet,\u201d only forced, secondhand; the special-effects\r\nanimals aren\u2019t nearly as arresting/disturbing as, say, the animatronic robin at\r\nthe end of \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d was. Soon enough, a vulgar fellow in a pickup harangues\r\nHolmes from the road, threatening her if she continues to refuse to accept his\r\noffer for a \u201cride,\u201d if you get what he\u2019s saying\r\nand-his-other-dialogue-will-guarantee-that-you-do, and she pulls a handgun from\r\nher purse and plugs him.

A phone call follows; Holmes\u2019 character, the title character of the\r\nmovie, asks her mother (Jean Smart) again what\u2019s the best organic way to remove\r\na bloodstain from a valued piece of clothing.  For the first thirty-five minutes or so, \u201cMiss Meadows\u201d\r\nunfolded for this viewer as a kind of cinematic curio. Written and directed by\r\nKaren Leigh Hopkins (who also scripted \u201cStepmom\u201d of 1998 and \u201cBecause I\r\nSaid So\u201d from 2007), \u201cMiss Meadows\u201d toddles along as a kind of spiritually\r\ninert not-quite satire. Substitute teacher Meadows advises her young charges to\r\nwish for the recovery of their ill regular teacher, and a sour colleague\r\nadvises the younger woman \u201cMrs. Dodd\u2019s got the big C, don\u2019t fill the kids with\r\nfalse hope.\u201d Miss Meadows responds in a way that indicates she\u2019s some kind of\r\nmonster of optimism, and her interesting habit of taking every turn of phrase\r\nliterally (after an awkward amorous encounter, her partner asks \u201cIs this your\r\nidea of pillow talk?\u201d and she replies \u201cPillows don\u2019t talk,\u201d oy) puts one in\r\nmind of another unsuccessful movie, Alan Rudolph\u2019s near-insufferable \u201cTrixie.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat is happening here, and why?\u201d I asked myself, although I wasn\u2019t quite\r\nsuffering. It was also a little unnerving to notice that Katie Holmes\u2019\r\nperformance was actually, in terms of what was being called for, was committed\r\nand conscientious in an above-and-beyond-the-call-of-duty sort of way. Trying\r\nto work up some optimism myself, I allowed that the movie could go either way.  Well, I was wrong. As Meadows enters into a tentative\r\nromance with a local law enforcement person (James Badge Dale) who is,\r\nsurprise, in charge of the curious case of a female vigilante, and Meadows\r\nbegins a cat-and-mouse game with a creepy neighbor who\u2019s also a recently\r\nreleased convict, the movie goes for something darker than the weird mess it\r\nhad previously realized, and becomes replete with dumb \u201cyou\u2019re-just-like-me\u201d\r\ndialogue exchanges. The earnestness brings the movie from mildly irritating\r\npastiche status to actively awful, and that is all she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Pulp\r\nFiction\u2019 meets \u2018Mary Poppins,\u2019\u201d a character observes of the vigilante ongoings\r\nabout midway through the picture.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Dawson City: Frozen Time", "Review": "\u201cDawson City: Frozen Time\u201d is a rather clunky and uninspiring title for a film that\u2019s both revelatory and deeply fascinating. A more evocatively poetic title, say \u201cGold and Silver,\u201d might suggest the extraordinary double helix of North American history and movie lore that Bill Morrison\u2019s found-footage documentary contains. The film owes its existence, first of all, to the coincidence that the last half-decade of the 19th century saw both the invention of cinema and a gold rush in a slice of western Canada that previously had been inhabited by Native Americans. In a very short time, hordes of prospectors flooded in, creating Dawson City, a Wild West mining town that reached its peak population of 40,000 within months. Advertisement Along with saloons and brothels, the burg\u2019s entertainment options soon included the novel diversion of movies. Within a couple of decades, as the silent cinema reached its artistic peak, the town found itself at the end of a distribution chain for film companies. A movie would open in big cities, then circulate to smaller and more distant towns, before ending up, usually after two years, at farflung Dawson City. Because the distributors didn\u2019t want the prints back, it was up to people in the town to dispose of them. Some were thrown into the Yukon River. Some were burned: a hazardous undertaking, since the films\u2019 silver nitrate content made them highly combustible. Other films, though, met the unusual fate of being used to fill in a municipal swimming pool that was being paved over to make an ice-skating rink. And it was there, during a construction project in 1978, that hundreds of them were discovered and returned to the world, creating the mother lode of celluloid images known as the Dawson City Collection. What Morrison has done with this trove of films\u2014as well as many pristine still photographs, some taken by photographers who plied their trade among the original miners\u2014is to intertwine several rich and engrossing narratives: the story of the original Klondike Gold Rush followed by the ups and downs of Dawson City over subsequent decades; the story of cinema as it evolved from a basic recording technology to the highly developed entertainment medium it was by the 1920s (and leaping forward to tell the preservation story of the Dawson City Collection); and the story of the world reflected in the movies uncovered in Dawson City, both newsreels and fiction films. Advertisement The gold rush story alone is worth the price of admission. With their combination of greed, foolishness, courage, riches, tragedy and spectacular landscapes, gold rushes are inherently visual and dramatic. The big one in California, though, happened a half-century too early to make it into the movies. The Dawson City boom happened right in sync with the new medium, so that we get to see the steam ships from San Francisco and Seattle and the avid faces of the would-be millionaires they deposit on the banks of the Yukon River, most of them headed only for disappointment as the good claims were staked before the vast majority arrived. \u201cMining the miners\u201d was how many folks learned how to make a living in such circumstances, and we get to see an improvised jumble of hotels, boarding houses, gin joints, gambling halls, theaters and various businesses that almost overnight became Dawson City. And then faded almost as rapidly. Finding no gold available to them, and hearing of a new strike in Nome, most miners quickly headed north to Alaska\u2014an exodus appropriately evoked with scenes from Chaplin\u2019s \u201cThe Gold Rush.\u201d  The Dawson City they left behind at one point saw its population dip as low as 1,000, but it remained a vital place with institutions such as one that housed both a movie theater and that swimming-pool-cum-skating-rink where the Dawson City Collection would be discovered. The town\u2019s gold mining business, meanwhile, served as a parable of capitalism: the various mines were soon bought up by one company, a tale in which Daniel and Solomon Guggenheim played a key role. During the same span of decades, the array of eventual luminaries who also passed through the area included Jack London, Sid Grauman, Alexander Pantages and William Desmond Taylor.  The American history we see in the films the Dawson City residents would have watched includes such events as the 1914 Ludlow Massacre, in which miners striking a Rockefeller company were gunned down by Colorado National Guardsmen, provoking massive labor protests in the East. Morrison links these events to one of America\u2019s great sports scandals, the World Series of 1919 (the Dawson City Collection includes crucial footage of its games), via the figure of Kenesaw Mountain Landis, an anti-labor judge who helped the government and big business deport radicals and battle labor organizing and was rewarded by being made commissioner of baseball following the scandal. I found these parts of the film to be its most compelling sections, but they almost suggest a much larger work: a Ken Burns history of organized labor and the forces that fought it. Advertisement The film contains no narration. Its various stories are told via images and printed titles. Much of its second hour is given over to contemplating many of the entertainment films discovered in Dawson City. These include no lost masterpieces or works by celebrated directors such as Griffith, von Stroheim, Ford or Hitchcock. Rather, what we see is a cavalcade of typical melodramas, adventures, comedies, westerns and romantic tales, mostly from the 1910s. While some of these have aesthetic or social interest, the section containing them feels diffuse and overlong. But that\u2019s a relatively forgivable flaw in a film that offers such an abundance of celluloid and historical riches."}

I myself was kind of curious as to how, at a time when it\r\nseems so many of the best film directors are moving over to television because\r\nthe feature filmmaking process can\u2019t accommodate their artistic ambitions, this\r\npompous, know-something-ish, navel-gazing, indulgent, pissy, priggish, albeit\r\nreasonably well-photographed, pile of sick got financed to completion. Because\r\n\"Among Ravens\" is, finally, a thoroughly noxious concoction.  \u201cRavens were once among the most colorful of birds,\u201d begins\r\nthe narration from the young girl Joey (Johnny Sequoyah, the best performer in\r\nthe movie). Joey sees her extended family as raven-like. Her biological dad, a\r\nbest-selling author named Saul King, who refers to himself as \u201cThe King,\u201d lists\r\n\u201cAn Unkindness of Ravens\u201d as among his tomes. So the metaphors, you see, start\r\nhitting right off the bat, as the movie introduces a schlubby life-coach\r\ncharacter (Calum Grant)\u00a0 and his\r\nsuper-post-hippie-dippie teen girlfriend (Castille Landon, playing a terribly\r\nunappealing variant on the Meg Tilly character in \"The Big Chill\"), Joey\u2019s\r\nconflicted-about-being-bourgeois mom Wendy (Amy Smart), Wendy\u2019s\r\nstrapped-for-income but not-wanting-to-show it husband Ellis (Joshua Leonard),\r\nall bantering and trading success stories until oddball Chad (Will McCormack)\r\ncomes along.\u00a0The\r\nstranger-who-upends-the-lives-of-complacent-characters trope is one with long\r\ncinematic history, and as soon as you get a long look at McCormack\u2019s goofy mug\r\nyou hope this isn\u2019t going to be a \"Teorema\"-style seducing scenario.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "All This Panic", "Review": "Regardless of how far removed you might be from your teenage years, also known as the agony-filled era of pain when the world is both your oyster and your enemy, you probably remember at least one thing about it: time never seemed to pass fast enough back then. Days felt longer. A school year just seemed to not end, and summer never arrived quickly enough. Jenny Gage\u2019s deep, shrewd and beautifully realized documentary \u201cAll This Panic\u201d is anchored in this very nature of time in the way teenagers generally relate to it. Its every dreamy scene, filled with worthiness and merit, is plugged in to an in-the-moment feeling that accompanies a group of young Brooklyn-women the film follows over a three year-period. No wonder the lean, 79-minute running time of \u201cAll This Panic\u201d is not a liability: Gage makes each minute boldly and deeply matter. Advertisement \u201cAll This Panic\u201d was conceived when debuting director Gage and her husband Tom Betterton, the cinematographer of the film, met Ginger and Dusty, two teenage sisters living in the same Clinton Hill neighborhood. After getting to know the two sisters and observing their evolving teenage lives, the couple slowly found themselves inside the circle of their friends, among which is Lena, Ginger\u2019s best friend, one of the strongest and most present voices within the group and in the documentary. An aspiring philosopher with family troubles, she recalls the time she casually found out one day that her parents were getting a divorce, during a family viewing of \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender.\u201d It left a mark on her. Then there is Sage, a brainy student who attends a high-status private school in Manhattan, raised by a single mother with whom she has a close relationship. The only black teenager among the group portrayed in the film and an outspoken feminist who complains about the over-sexualized female body, Sage seems to have figured out the lose-lose way women are ruthlessly categorized in society based on their looks. We also get to meet Olivia, a kindly, soft-spoken young woman who\u2019s just figuring out her sexual identity. She candidly but ever so shyly speaks of her sexual leanings and doubts while being filmed, though she notes she hasn\u2019t yet shared it with anyone close to her. The last two members of the circle are Delia, Olivia\u2019s best friend who seems to detest \u201call this panic\u201d with regards to high school (one example is her friends frantically trying to pick the right outfit for the first day of school), and the savvy and resourceful Ivy. The method of filming the girls over a three-year period might inevitably bring to mind Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cBoyhood,\u201d in which he told the fictional life story of a Texan boy over a 12-year-period, using the same actors throughout. Linklater\u2019s accomplished narrative feature isn\u2019t quite an apt comparison for \u201cAll This Panic\u201d however, since the girls\u2019 evolution in front of the camera\u2014from changing hairstyles and colors to budding ideals and growing frustrations\u2014is an organic process, which Gage and Betterton lovingly observe without interference. If anything, the fleeting sense we get from the passage of time in \u201cAll This Panic,\u201d the lack of pretension between friends and the general hazy feeling stretched over the collective angst of the seven teenagers loosely resembles David Robert Mitchell\u2019s \u201cThe Myth of the American Sleepover\u201d instead, a recent-ish and under-seen narrative that also deals with teenage anxieties and troubles. We quietly survey as sexualities bourgeon, personalities develop and get between longtime friendships, and curiosities spark in this unusual coming-of-age film, edited and assembled with understated grace.  Advertisement Throughout \u201cAll This Panic,\u201d Gage and Betterton\u2019s professional background in photography luxuriously shows. In one of the film\u2019s earlier scenes, we watch Dusty and Lena converse and quarrel on a picturesque beach; an incident shot with artistic framing that evokes a sense of melancholy. The duo consistently treats less visually appealing environs with the same discipline, making brick walls, cramped interiors and rundown rooftops seem intentional and beautiful creative choices rather than obligatory backdrops. In the end, what they achieve is both meaningful and strikingly beautiful, full of that boundless hopeful mystery one feels at maximum during teenage years."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Outlaws and Angels", "Review": "\u201cOutlaws & Angels\u201d puts any disappointment felt about Quentin Tarantino\u2019s recent, bloated Western \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d into perspective. This Western too focuses on a group of morally grotesque folk spending most of their time under one roof, while encountering pain as means for revenge, as distinctly shot on film. But the difference between Tarantino and his endless imitators has always proved vast, especially when a budding filmmaker cribs his style to shallow results. A movie hopped up on the period piece sadism within Tarantino\u2019s regurgitation cinema, \u201cOutlaws & Angels\u201d gravely mistakes Tarantino\u2019s audaciousness for its own originality. Advertisement At the very least, one never questions when watching a Tarantino movie if he\u2019s invested in his period. That\u2019s the first huge problem with writer/director JT Mollner\u2019s \u201cOutlaws & Angels,\u201d which has a nagging air of mere genre exercise from the beginning, as a group of generic bank robbers are introduced (the credits graphics pointing out their individual mugs, covered in sacks) amidst flat dialogue and even worse line delivery. Their brief interactions after a bloody heist are intercut with the man of law pursuing them (Luke Wilson), who babbles white noise voiceover while being used at most to pose in super wide shots within lifeless montages. The end point belongs to the third party, a frontier family of two daughters (Francesca Eastwood and Madisen Beaty) and a mother and father (Teri Polo and Ben Browder), who are unhinged beyond their religious fanaticism\u2014for example, the older sister bullies the younger by sneaking up behind her and forcing her fingers down her throat, making her throw up, as kids so often do.\u00a0 By the end of its first act, \u201cOutlaws & Angels\u201d has achieved very little. There\u2019s no one that you to hope to get out alive, not even the debut writer/director. So it\u2019s no thrill when the outlaws (led by Chad Michael Murray\u2019s Henry, gurgling his dialogue like Brad Pitt\u2019s Lt. Aldo Raine in \u201cInglorious Basterds\u201d) show up to the house of the family at night, seeking food and flesh, and find themselves punishing the emasculated patriarch for previous incestual episodes with his daughters. What ensues is less horrifying than it is exceptionally desperate, as the outlaws assault members of the family, physically and sexually, with Mollner mining cheap discomfort for amoral edge. A supposed hero emerges later in youngest daughter Florence (Eastwood), although she slowly aligns with the bandits\u2019 taste for sadism as well. With blonde hair, piercing eyes and a weapons-ready attitude, she is not the hero that takes us to a more concentrated, surprising third act, but merely gives us a fan fiction-level version of a Tarantino heroine.\u00a0 The centerpiece of \u201cOutlaws & Angels\u201d is a scene of threatened sodomy, which runs about 10 minutes, after a character is heard defecating themselves while being dragged away. It earns the designation \u201ccenterpiece\u201d not for a huge narrative development that happens in the scene, but because it's clearly the moment Mollner put the most effort into; to block his actors so that they can shift in and out of the room with a camera that moves around a dinner table, all to embrace the grit that comes from not cutting away from an image captured on film. The failure of this scene is emblematic of the entire project: the stale dialogue between a threatening Murray and a terrified Browder would have been equally expressive in grunts and shrieks, this talky moment lacking the tension that can make Tarantino\u2019s iconic, word-driven stand-offs captivating. As a single take, it only reminds the viewer of how often the movie is pointed towards showmanship\u2014watch me splatter my actress in red corn syrup in slow motion while playing an Erik Satie piece\u2014and that, not coincidentally, it has huge pacing issues.\u00a0 Advertisement For whatever other Westerns may have also inspired \u201cOutlaws & Angels\u201d (Frances Fisher of \u201cUnforgiven\u201d makes a brief cameo), Mollner\u2019s contribution always comes back to its core Tarantino influence\u2014even the film's allegiance to Kodak film stock makes its blood-bursting action directly echo the albeit smaller-scale violence of \"Django Unchained.\"\u00a0But in a sea of grimy indie Westerns, especially ones that started with the same genre canvas (last year\u2019s \u201cBone Tomahawk\u201d comes to mind, and is far more innovative), \u201cOutlaws & Angels\u201d is a thoroughly ugly example of when \u201cTarantino-esque\u201d is the most generous compliment."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Jackie", "Review": "There are two movies in \"Jackie,\" Pablo Larra\u00edn's film about Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) immediately before, during and after the assassination of her husband, President John F. Kennedy. One of these movies is just OK. The other is exceptional. The first one keeps undermining the second. \u00a0 Movie number one is a fictionalized biography in which a famous subject sits for a long interview, here with a magazine reporter played by Billy Crudup (unnamed but based on biographer Theodore H. White, who wrote \u201cFor President Kennedy: An Epilogue,\" a Life article that ran one week after President John F. Kennedy's assassination). This one is a movie where an important person contemplates his or her place in history and tries to control how they are perceived. It's fuzzy and overreaching and has been done better elsewhere.\u00a0 Advertisement The individual scenes in this \"historical figure contemplates self\" film are competently done and sometimes a good deal more than that, thanks to undertones of empathy and condescension in the dialogue. The reporter is often condescending to the former First Lady. Sometimes he even interrupts her when she's speaking or tries to put words in her mouth or dismiss her concerns, which shows how not-powerful even a very powerful woman can be when she's in a room with a man who's been told since birth that his words and actions are inherently more important than any woman's. This material in this second film connects to moments in the inevitable flashbacks to Jackie's heyday in Camelot and right after John F. Kennedy's murder. We see Jackie, often the lone woman in a room full of men, trying to assert herself and say what she wants and needs, only to be told (by White House staffers, military people, even her RFK) that it's impossible\u2014because of security or protocol or precedent or simply because the men just mysteriously know better than her\u2014and she should give up. But the framing device is not ultimately necessary (few are, alas) because, whether the reporter and Jackie are talking about what's on the record or off the record, and whether what Jackie is saying is objectively true or merely self-serving, we have already seen everything both of them might have had to say illustrated, in a more immediate and often wrenching way, by the flashbacks.\u00a0 The flashbacks constitute a second, far superior film, one that has the shock of revelation: we've seen this tight, crucial chapter of history re-enacted many times from all sorts of vantage points, but rarely in depth and mainly from the point-of-view of Jackie, who had to go through the gist of what everyone goes through when they lose a mate, only on the world's largest stage.\u00a0 But whenever Larra\u00edn and his cast and crew build up a head of dramatic steam in the \"past\" (which feels far more \"present\" than the interview stuff), and keep building it up until it starts to feel like the raw material for an unwritten opera or an unmade psychological horror movie, \"Jackie\" fecklessly yanks us out of that emotional head-space, and returns us to the reporter and Jackie hashing over what it means. \u00a0 The second movie in \"Jackie\" is new and often powerful, and it derives all of its newness and power from specifics. This \"Jackie\" is the story of a woman who suddenly, violently lost her husband, then had to figure out how to get through the next few days of her life without surrendering her sanity along with whatever power she once had. The mundane nature of this second movie is what makes it feel so eerily accurate. Details such as the specific bloodstains on Jackie's clothes and the bruise revealed on her shin as she takes her stockings off, the point-of-view shots of Jackie looking at all those men who have concluded they should decide her fate for her, the catch in Jackie's voice as she tries to tell her children that their father is dead without using the word \"death,\" the way she goes into a depressive reverie and starts going through her clothes and trying on various dresses while listening to Jack's favorite album, the original cast recording of \"Camelot\": all of this feels achingly true. But Larra\u00edn pushes the \"power\" of it all too hard (often by ladling on Mica Levi's lyrical yet too often bombastic score). Even Portman's accent-driven performance, while ferociously committed, feels too much like a researched, considered, Marilyn Monroe-breathy impersonation, one that has been constructed from the outside in rather than incarnated from within.\u00a0Rarely have I seen a more vivid example of artists getting in their own way and tripping themselves up.\u00a0 Advertisement A big part of the problem (for me, anyway) is that Larra\u00edn seems to want to make a statement, perhaps one of the ultimate statements, on the transformation of lived experience into myth. This film really doesn't have the intellectual chops to pull it off, never mind the question of whether that sort of movie is inherently more important and serious and worthy of critical superlatives than the simpler, more emotionally driven one about a widow coming to terms with the loss of her husband and her responsibilities to her children (both the biological ones and the symbolic ones, i.e. the American people).  Jackie as fantasy object upon whom hundreds of millions of less famous women can project their fears, goals and desires; Jackie as wife and mother, trying to keep it together during the worst few days of her life; Jackie as faithful spouse wounded by her handsome husband's infidelity; even Jackie as First Lady of the United States, looking out over a horrifically altered global landscape and asking what's next: all these Jackies are present in the hours and days preceding and following the murder. These various self-states are embedded in the way Jackie moves through rooms while the camera follows her, the way she looks at objects and people, and the way she struggles to compose herself and articulate her needs without deferring to whatever man she happens to be speaking with.  Jackie has to stand for herself but also for Jackie the historical figure, the myth, the oversimplification, the blank slate, the retrograde but at the same time revolutionary aspirational figure, and so on. We never feel as powerfully connected to this Jackie as we do to the one who suddenly has to move out of the house she's been living in for less than three years because her husband's brains were blown out in a motorcade. Meanwhile, the other characters are allowed to stand for one or two things only, always in relation to Jackie, and as a result, the film's supporting performances (particularly by Peter Saarsgaard as Robert Kennedy, who doesn't look or sound much like him, and who cares) feel a lot more fully imagined and realized. Actors always fail when they are asked to incarnate ideas, while they tend to do quite well with specifics like, \"You are playing Robert, the brother of the murdered man, and the only person who understands your sister-in-law's pain.\" Advertisement The great movie that is \"Jackie\" keeps fighting to free itself from the clammy clutches of the could-have-been-better, knows-what-best-for-us movie. After a while the struggle becomes indistinguishable from the struggle depicted in the movie itself.  \"Jackie\" the drama (at times melodrama) knows what it is and what it wants to say. It trusts the audience to figure it all out and speaks to us via intuition, often taking considerable risks and making itself quite vulnerable. It is what would have been dismissed in another era as a \"woman's movie\"\u2014i.e. a movie about the emotional experience of a woman\u2014only to be reclaimed much later by historians and critics who struggle to get others to see that this kind of film is just as valid and worthy of scrutiny as the sort of movie where famous people sit for interviews about their legacy and spar about truth and fiction, performance and authenticity. (The character of Jackie is already starting to shape her own myth in the flashback material anyway; it's all there if you feel like looking for it, and as is the case throughout \"Jackie,\" it's done with a lot more imagination than anything in the interview segments.) Ironic that Jackie's story here is mainly one of a woman trying to imagine her own experience on her own terms, only to be told by various parties, mainly male, that she's wrong, or that it's not enough."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Nocturama", "Review": "Roger Ebert's belief that cinema is a machine that generates empathy applies to \"Nocturama,\" a French thriller about a group of teenage  Parisian\u00a0terrorists. As a work of political provocation\u2014one that asks  viewers to relate with kids who endanger, and murder innocent  civilians\u2014\"Nocturama\" is useless, since the politics, background,  and motives of writer/director Bertrand Bonello's young characters are  not developed beyond a basic point. But Bonello (\"Saint  Laurent,\" \"House of Tolerance\") doesn't seem to care about ideology or  psychology. Instead, he focuses primarily on what his characters are  feeling and thinking on the day that they  bomb and/or set fire to multiple targets around Paris, and then hole up  over night in a nearby mall.  Advertisement The movie conveys the range of emotions and ideas\u00a0that the characters experience through a series of  elaborate flashbacks, several of which go back  in time just a few minutes or seconds earlier, to relate what other  characters were doing at pivotal moments. The filmmaker refuses to pigeonhole  his protagonists with trite exposition. Instead, he relies  heavily on visual cues and clipped, opaque conversations\u00a0to  relate both the limits of our knowledge and the depth of his subjects'  feelings. Bonello doesn't coddle viewers, but he does give us a world  of information conveyed simply, without heavy-handed commentary.\u00a0    \"Nocturama\" starts on the afternoon of the never-named terrorist group's attack. These kids  have no clear leader, though no-nonsense Andre (Martin Petit-Guyot)  comes closest. That said, they  are hyper-organized, and very few of them show signs of hesitation. Each fulfills a role: Mika (Jamil McCraven) delivers an explosive while  romanticallly involved couple David (Finnegan Oldfield) and Sarah (Laure  Valentinelli) clear an office building's\u00a028th  and 29th floor, which are already under construction. Meanwhile, Greg  (Vincent Rottiers) keeps an eye out for security guards while Sabrina  (Manal Issa) uses a cherry-picker to douse a statue of Joan of Arc in  lighter fluid.  We don't learn anyone's names at first. They're not important as individuals beyond the  functions that they perform in the story. One swipes a credit card at a boutique  clothing store and waits nervously for her purchase to be authorized.  Others push their way past a security checkpoint  using a counterfeit access card. Their colleagues ride the subway and  try to act casual as they abandon cell phones in public trash cans,  plant explosives, and check into hotel rooms under fake names. They are a  well-oiled machine, momentarily working against  a much larger system. Advertisement    It's never  really clear why these kids behave the way they do. This might seem like  a fundamental creative shortcoming, but Bonello makes it work to his  advantage. Why pigeonhole these characters  by allying them with a specific political ideology when you can let  their actions\u2014specifically their callow fascination with material  goods, their love of rap and vintage pop\u00a0music, and their giddy  attraction to violence\u2014speak for them? When these kids speak,  they don't talk for Bonello, or each other, but rather for themselves and to each other, and  only in the moments that they're speaking.  One boy believes he's going to  heaven. Another feels guilty and fears death. Several teens are hiding  secrets from each other. These are not authority figures in adolescent bodies, but rather  children who chose to rebel with an unthinkable act of violence. If  \"Nocturama\" is a commentary about politics, it's about the politics of  avoidance, and the juvenile emphasis on being heard\u00a0over  having something essential to say.    Bonello is a master  of blunt but simply expressed symbolism, and he often  conveys the majority of his characters' feelings through clipped,  well-measured bits of naturalistic talk.  Even flashbacks that threaten to editiorialize or hint at the  real reasons why these kids did what they did are open to  interpretation, as when one teen recalls a political history essay he  wrote about how periods of decadence are always  followed by a period of violent  reconstruction and then by renaissances. The fact that he doesn't dwell on cultural upheaval is  telling. These kids are on auto-pilot, as evidenced by the way they  clear  out a mall by calling in a bomb scare and hastily dispatching the  stores' security guards, then carry on like kids in a candy store. They play with war toys, try on make-up, and  perform karaoke for each other using\u00a0expensive home entertainment systems. Mannequins surround them. The echoes  of their footsteps haunt them. Designer labels accost them  everywhere: dresses by Celestina Agostino. Bedding by Alexandre  Turpault. Jewelry by Isabel Marant.    Bonello draws viewers in by letting circumstantial tension and quiet, private little gestures define the characters. We  get to fill in the blanks when Mika dons a  mask that obscures his facial features and looks at himself in the  mirror. You can't definitively know if he likes what he sees, or if he's  even thinking at all. We are also encouraged to draw our own  conclusions when Omar (Rabah Nait Oufella) drives around  a toy store in a child's dune buggy. We follow him for a few moment as  he careens around the display floor, periodically driving behind a  plastic tarp that marks where the store ends and an employees-only  area begins. This scene fragment tellingly  ends with the dune buggy disappearing behind the tarp. Bonello knows exactly  when he's said just enough, and that makes the experience of watching  \"Nocturama\" more engaging. Advertisement    Despite how much information he purposefully  withholds, Bonello's film is  remarkably accessible. We see these kids' fears of being assimilated into a culture  that only wants their blind allegiance. We see how they confuse counter-cultural influences as a separate kind  of anti-system. Finally, we realize the limits of their knowledge  and experiences, without the film feeling the need to overstate this.  \"Nocturama\" engages critical thinking while it unassumingly works your emotions over.  You may not think that a movie that asks you to understand terrorists is for you, but if you give Bonello 130 minutes of your time,  he'll make you a believer."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Our Irish Cousins", "Review": "Under normal circumstances, comparing a feature film to a home movie would seem like harsh criticism, but in the case of the new documentary \"Our Irish Cousins,\" that is pretty much the only way to honestly describe it. The difference is that this one has been made with such genial spirits and good humor that viewers won't mind spend 90 minutes watching it, which is more than you can say about most home movies, including your own. The film is the brainchild of Mike Houlihan, a Chicago-born writer (who penned the \"Houli in the Hood\" column for the Chicago Sun-Times between 2002-2005), actor, filmmaker and all around-raconteur of the highest order. Among his multitude of credits is the \"Hooliganism\" column that he has written for the Irish American Times since 1996, consisting of stories, anecdotes and tall tales largely inspired by his experiences growing up as the seventh child of a South Side Irish-Catholic family. In 2008, he compiled his best columns into the anthology \"Hooliganism\" and \"Our Irish Cousins\" follows him as he sets out to promote the book. Advertisement As Houlihan makes a string of personal appearances around Chicago, it becomes apparent that this tour is not exactly going to be a bonanza from a financial perspective. And yet, while the crowds may not be large, they are enthusiastic and, more important, they all seem to have unique perspectives on what it means to be Irish-American and are willing to share them with Houlihan and his camera. The one thing that they, Houlihan included, have in common is that while they proudly declare themselves Irish-Americans, few of them have ever actually been to Ireland. A few weeks later, in March, 2009, Houlihan sets off for Ireland with his family in tow. Ostensibly, the trip is to promote the book, but he's also out to trace his own ancestry and to examine the intense pride that the Irish feel about their heritage. His quest takes him from Fitzpatrick Castle in Dublin to the town in Limerick County where his grandfather came from, with the occasional pub stop along the way. As he continues his journey, he gets further perspectives of what unites and separates the Irish and Irish-Americans, in both the grand scheme of things and in personal terms. As anyone familiar with Houlihan's work can attest, the man is a born storyteller \u2014 the kind of guy who can make a statement along the lines of \"You know what's funny? Here's a good story. My brother died ...\" and then actually pull it off. He gets a lot of laughs throughout the film, whether from well-polished anecdotes or spontaneous interactions with the people he meets. What is even more impressive, though, is the way that he manages to quietly layer in more serious-minded concerns amidst the laughter so that when he visits the church where his grandfather was baptized more than a century earlier, the scene winds up packing a surprisingly hefty emotional punch.  Advertisement Houlihan was also lucky enough to come across a number of people just as charmingly loquacious as he is and some of the funniest and wisest moments come from their comments. Arguably the highlight of the entire film is his encounter with Mike Monaghan, an old friend who now resides in Galway. Monaghan's brief soliloquy about the fundamental difference between an Irish person visiting American and an American visiting Ireland is alone worth the price of admission. Another key observation comes from comedian Des Bishop, who sums up the belief that being Irish is more a notion of simple geography by stating, \"If Ireland were just an island, no one would give a s---.\" \"Our Irish Cousins\" does not exactly reinvent the cinematic wheel, but I would take its scruffy, low-fi charms over the hard-sell whimsy of nonsense like \"Waking Ned Devine\" in a heartbeat. Although those of Irish descent are clearly the target audience for \"Our Irish Cousins,\" a good part of the secret to its success is that you don't have to be from the Emerald Isle to appreciate it. No matter where you come from or how much corned beef you've consumed in your lifetime, you'll most likely find that Houlihan's observations about the importance of examining and coming to terms with one's heritage still ring true."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Dolores", "Review": "The United States is not a country especially fond of labor leaders, but Cesar Chavez, who organized Mexican-American farm workers and\u00a0co-founded the National Farm Workers Association, still managed to make his way into public school history textbooks. His partner in that enterprise, Dolores Huerta, has largely escaped mainstream attention, and Peter Bratt's documentary \"Dolores\" argues that it's mainly because of a streak of sexism that affects every area of history across the political spectrum.\u00a0 Advertisement Huerta, who is 87 and still active and lucid, is her own most persuasive onscreen witness, but there are many others as well. The film tells her story in a plainspoken style that befits the subject. It's also a primer in how a political figure's private life can become the focus of attacks when attempts to derail her message aren't making\u00a0 headway.\u00a0 Huerta was a star in the labor movement from an early age. By the time she was 25, she had written legislation as part of California\u2019s Community Service Organization. Before she turned thirty, she had co-founded the Agricultural Workers Association with Chavez, the organization that ultimately changed its name to United Farm Workers. Huerta. Chavez's efforts to organize American farm workers was opposed at every turn and on every level of white dominated society.\u00a0 One of the film's more provocative aspects is the way it links U.S. opposition to labor organizations with the legacy of slavery, linking the treatment of predominantly Mexican-American farm workers in California to the plight of African-Americans from Reconstruction to the present. In an arrangement reminiscent of slave plantations and post-Civil War sharecropping, many of them lived with their extended families on property that they served while performing stoop labor for basement wages. As older veterans of early twentieth century farm labor tell the filmmaker, physical and even sexual abuse were rampant on some of these farms. Daily harassment, racist behavior and an overall climate of cruelty were commonplace even on properties that were considered relatively civilized. Workers were afraid to object, fearing not only that they would be fired and ejected from the property but that their extended families would be kicked out, too, to cement the message that under capitalism, the only punishable sin is saying no to the boss. A contemporary of Huerta's says that for many decades, workers expected \"that we will not see national union in our lifetime because the growers are too wealthy, too powerful and too racist.\" Huerta, Chavez and other organizers helped change that, although, as the movie points out, the situation for farm workers remains troublesome to this day.  Huerta's progress within the labor movement was hampered by the macho temperament of the movement, a predicament that many figures in American labor, and throughout political movements around the world, have described as a constant throughout history. Many of the most headline-grabbing tactics of the movement were Huerta's doing, and as she became more famous and comfortable, she made sure to live in the same poor communities that she served, to blunt criticisms that she had no connection to them or was only in it for her own enrichment. Yet she never got the credit she deserved, and Chavez himself became irritated by her refusal to take a backseat while he served as the public face of the movement.  Advertisement Enemies of Huerta seized on her private life to discredit her: she had two divorces, had eleven children by three men, and was frequently absent from her household because of her organizing duties, biographical facts that were used to tar her as someone who advocated corporate responsibility while conducting her own affairs in a heedless manner. Similar accusations are rarely made against men whose domestic lives are a trainwreck, or who have made the decision to put their work first. More recently, Huerta was banned from some college campus speaking engagements after saying that, as a party, Republicans are reflexively racist toward Latinos, a statement she has never retracted. Huerta has remained, publicly at least, impervious to any slings and arrows that have come her way. In both past and present interviews, she comes off as a smiling steamroller of a woman, rolling forward no matter what obstacles are placed in her path. She doesn't seem particularly troubled by anyone's opinion of her as a political figure or a private individual. While viewers will inevitably bring their own world view to bear on her life and work, Huerta's obstinate nature makes her a compelling movie heroine, in the vein of countless male rebel figures who don't care if you like them as long as you're hearing what they have to say. There's no special filmmaking excitement on display here\u2014the storytelling is orderly to a fault, and Bratt sprints through certain moments, presumably in the interest of pacing, that might've benefited from more careful consideration\u2014but Huerta is such a commanding figure, and the array of historical footage marshalled on behalf of her story is so impressive, that the film makes a strong impression."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Samsara", "Review": "In the 1970s, \"Samsara\" would have been known as a head trip. The critic Matt Zoller Seitz calls it \"a trance movie.\" For Fricke and his producer and collaborator Mark Magidson, it is a continuation of the meditative imagery they used in \"Baraka\" (1992), which intensely regarded the strangeness and wonder of our planet. Both films draw a sharp contract between the awe of nature and the sometimes ruthless imposition of man's will. I learn from Wikipedia that \"samsara,\" literally meaning \"continuous flow,\" is \"the repeating cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth\" within such Indian religions as Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. \"Baraka\" can refer to God's blessing.  Advertisement I met Fricke and Magidson when a restored version of \"Baraka\" was shown at Ebertfest, and had the impression that traveling the world and recording these images was sort of their calling. Some of these places, structures, peoples and practices will not endure forever, and if this planet someday becomes barren and lifeless, these films could show visitors what was here. \"Samsara\" may also suggest some of the ways in which it was lost. Although the documentary presents speeded-up images of city traffic and unseemly mechanical haste, for me the most unforgettable sequence is not one of breathtaking vistas or natural beauty, but of chickens in a food-processing plant. They are \"processed\" with such efficiency. Having spent their entire lives being fed while enclosed in cages too small for them to turn around, they now suddenly find themselves on a slippery stainless steel slope that feeds them relentlessly into a mechanical process that in a few seconds beheads them, strips them of feathers and skin, and slices them into parts. Chickens never seem very smart, but we can see the alarm in their behavior because this process is obvious to them. Now why would I dwell on such a sequence, which is probably largely responsible for the film's PG-13 rating? Because I experienced it as a shriek of terror. On this ancient and miraculous world, where such beautiful natural and living things have evolved, something has gone wrong when life itself is used as a manufacturing process. I read that in 50 years, we must adopt a largely vegetarian diet or die, and forgive me if I take that as good news. Something is out of balance, and \"Samsara\" regards the sides of the equation. I fear I haven't communicated what an uplifting experience the film is. In its grand sweep, the chickens play a tiny role. If you see it as a trance movie, a meditation, a head trip or whatever, it may cause you to become more thankful for what we have here. It is a rather noble film."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "30 Minutes or Less", "Review": "I should do a little more research, but I think \"30 Minutes or Less\" is the first R-rated slacker comedy based on a true recent story in which a man was blown up by a bomb strapped around his neck. You may recall the 2003 case of a pizza delivery man who dreamed up a scheme to rob a bank with a bomb strapped on him. He thought it was fake, but his treacherous partners double-crossed him. Now here is a movie about a guy who drives for a Grand Rapids, Mich., pizzeria that promises your pizza in 30 minutes or less. That of course establishes him as a breakneck stunt driver, which will be useful in the inevitable chase scene. The driver, named Nick, is played by Jesse Eisenberg, in an unfortunate career move after \"The Social Network.\" He was so good in that film that it is impossible to believe him as a character a dumb as Nick. For comparison, try to imagine George Clooney, Ben Kingsley and John Malkovich playing the Three Stooges. Advertisement His best buddy is Chet (Aziz Ansari), who goes ballistic when he discovers Nick has slept with his beautiful twin sister, Kate (Dilshad Vadsaria). That causes complications when Nick turns to Chet in desperation with a bomb strapped to his chest. How did this happen? We meet two slacker layabouts, Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson). Hapless, luckless and witless, they make 10 bucks an hour cleaning the pool of Dwayne's father (Fred Ward). One night during a lap dance, Dwayne mentions his dad is a lottery winner. Juicy (Bianca Kajlich), the dancer, then promises that Dwayne's lap need never be untenanted again if he steals a million from his dad. She even suggests a hit man from Detroit, Chango (Michael Pena).  Their brainstorm: Order a pizza, strap a bomb to the guy and have him rob a bank to get them the money to pay the hit man, who will then kill the lottery-winning dad. Need I explain that everyone involved in this plot is stupid enough to go along with it? The time bomb deadline ramps up the urgency and leads to great desperation. The movie's strategic error is to set the deadline too far in the future. There is something annoying about a comedy where a guy is strapped to a bomb and nevertheless has time to spare for off-topic shouting matches with his best buddy. A buddy comedy loses some of its charm in a situation like that. Certain moments in the film elicit mechanical laughs. The chase is well-staged, but then staging a good chase, in this era of CGI, is becoming routine. Eisenberg is a good actor, which may be why he's wrong for this dumb comedy. The tension over his buddy's sister feels contrived, and only one line is devoted to the intriguing implications that she's a twin sister. Oh, and the only purpose of Kate is to be beautiful. She is plugged into the plot, used to establish her existence, and dropped. If she had been more involved, that might have been an improvement \u2014 or might have shown up the plot's shaky contrivance. Better to devote more screen time to the lap dancer, right? Moral of the story: If you occupy the demographic that this film is aimed at, Hollywood doesn't have a very high opinion of you. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Bella", "Review": "'Bella\" tells the story of two people who fall in love because of an unborn child. Winner of the People's Choice Award at Toronto 2006, it is a heart-tugger with the confidence not to tug too hard. It stars an actor named Eduardo Verastegui, who I would describe as the next Antonio Banderas if I ever wrote cliches like that, which I do not. Tall, handsome, bearded, he plays Jose, the chef of his brother's Mexican restaurant in New York, until his life changes one day when his brother fires a waitress named Nina (Tammy Blanchard) for being late. Advertisement Jose and Nina are not a couple. All the same, he walks out of the kitchen, chases her into the subway, apologizes that his brother humiliated her in front of the staff, and finds out she was late because she is pregnant. Now what kind of a reason is that for being late? If I were in the habit of criticizing other critics, which I am not, I would quote Robert Koehler of Variety, who writes: \"Nina, however, could easily have been to work on time, since her delay was due to her buying and using a home pregnancy test -- something she rationally would have done after her shift was over.\" Uh-huh. And if Mr. Koehler feared he was pregnant, which would he do first? Buy and use a home pregnancy test, or review \"Bella\"? I don't trust a review written by some guy who's wondering if he's pregnant. Jose and Nina walk and talk, have lunch, share memories, and go to a restaurant where the owner, a friend of Jose's, offers to hire them both. Along the way, Jose tries to persuade her to have the child. He is motivated by reasons that are fully explained in early premonitions and later flashbacks, which I will not reveal. Perhaps the clincher on his argument is provided by a visit to his mother and father (Angelica Aragon and Jaime Tirelli), whose warmth is a contrast to Nina's own wretched past. Counterpoint is provided by Jose's brother Manny (Manny Perez), who apparently was not as affected by the sunshine in his childhood home. He's a martinet and perfectionist, a taskmaster, heartless, and (as it turns out), incompetent to run his own kitchen. His attitude to Nina's pregnancy is about as abstract as Robert Koehler's. Compare them to a man who is bearing a child. Remember Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"Junior,\" the movie where he was pregnant and said that merely scooping out the center of a honeydew melon gave him a you know. Advertisement I have failed to convey the charm of the movie. Verastegui, despite sporting a beard so thick and black it makes him look like a 19th century anarchist, has friendly eyes, a ready smile, and a natural grace in front of the camera that will soon have fans shifting their Banderas pinups to the bottom drawer. And Blanchard fits comfortably into the role of a woman who wants to do the right thing but feels alone, friendless and broke. All she needs is someone to trust, and she melts. There is also a lot of cooking in the movie. Jungles of cilantro are chopped. The restaurant's staff luncheon features quail in a mole sauce. Verastegui looks like he knows what he's doing in the kitchen. His IMDb profile says he likes cooking, which I believe, although that's usually the desperation answer by people who can't think of anything they like. You sense a little of that, indeed, in his profile's next two sentences: (1) \"He has a golden retriever,\" (2) \"He likes golden retrievers.\" He stops short of liking to cook golden retrievers. The movie is not profound, but it's not stupid. It's about lovable people having important conversations and is not pro-choice or pro-life but simply in favor of his feelings -- and hers, if she felt free to feel them. The movie is a little more lightweight than the usual People's Choice Award winner at Toronto, but why not? It was the best-liked film at the 2006 festival, and I can understand that."}

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Rails & Ties", "Review": "Sometimes there's a movie that has better things in it than the underlying material deserves. Alison Eastwood's \"Rails & Ties\" is a movie like that. I found the opening third tremendously intriguing and involving, I thought the emotions were so real they could be touched, but then the film lost its way and fell into the clutches of sentimental melodrama. It opens on a railroad engineer going to work. This is Tom Stark (Kevin Bacon), and he doesn't merely love his job but feels a sense of duty about it that is part of the fiber of his being. He has been told he can take the day off because of bad news he has received about the health of his wife. But he wouldn't think of it. He follows the railroad book on all things, including life and death. Advertisement We meet his wife, Megan (Marcia Gay Harden), who is dying of cancer and filled with fear and grief, and she has some moments that are heartbreaking. She needs her husband, or maybe she needs a husband who could be emotionally available to her; Tom is not there for her and hasn't been for years, pouring all of his passion into trains. At work, he's behind the throttle, and at home, he's tinkering with his elaborate model train layout. We meet another mother and her young son. This is Laura Danner (Bonnie Root), who has big problems and has taken a lot of pills and parked her car on the tracks with her 9-year-old son, Davey (Miles Heizer), belted in next to her. Coming around a bend, Tom sees the car on the tracks but makes a snap judgment that an emergency stop might throw cars off the track and injure passengers. His co-engineer (Eugene Byrd) begs him to brake, but Tom knows the book, the book covers the situation, and the book says not to brake. Davey gets out of the car, tries to pull his mother free and jumps aside just seconds before he would have been killed along with her. \"He didn't even try to stop!\" Davey says over and over again. Tom Stark knows there will be a hearing but is confident he will get a pass, because he was following the book. And all of that, up to there and for several more scenes, plays immediate and true. But then the movie veers into a more standard storytelling pattern. Because much of it is well done, for what it is, I won't reveal key details. But assume that in one way or another the boy has good reason to escape from a foster home and that he finds a way to meet Tom and Megan Stark. Yes, he feels anger toward the man. Perhaps some of it is displaced from his mom, whose decision to park on the tracks remains a troubling mystery to him. The way things work out, his visit to the Starks, which should have been over almost immediately, seems to extend indefinitely. And they begin to love one another. This in itself is not an unworthy plot development, but somehow the urgency of Megan's early grief and Tom's early emotional stonewalling get channeled into acceptable, safe, narrative strategies. We can relax. The story will steer us safely past unacceptable despair. There is even a scene involving the model train layout to clear the air because, yes, Davey likes trains about as much as Tom does. And then one development leads to another and everything leads up to a final scene and a final shot that I found myself rejecting emotionally. Advertisement I know in the real world that what happens at the end of the movie is likely enough. But other outcomes are possible, and given the places the movie took me and the implicit promises it made, I found no release and closure in the ending. In a movie that detoured into emotional manipulation, I found myself, paradoxically, wanting more manipulation. When a movie jumps the tracks of implacable logic, you may regret it, but you go along with it because you have to. The last thing you want is for it to jump back on the tracks. That is not to overlook the qualities of \"Rails & Ties,\" above all in the acting. Marcia Gay Harden has a scene by herself that defines hopelessness and desolation. Kevin Bacon makes it clear, without even seeming to try, why the railroad is his fortress and its rule book is his bible. And young Miles Heizer does such a good job with the 9-year-old that I repeat a recent observation: Have you noticed in a lot of movies how natural, convincing and pure the performances of the child actors are? Alison Eastwood (Clint's daughter) must be a good director because she can place those qualities on the screen. I wish I knew more about the history of the Micky Levy screenplay -- whether it went through rewrites, was steered in a wrong direction, was questioned. When the film premiered at Telluride and Toronto, there were some who doubted coincidences involving characters and trains. Those sorts of things go with the territory, and I find it interesting that the screenplay risked them. But there were fundamental decisions to be made about the lives and fates of these characters, and I think somehow the filmmakers lost the way, lost sight of the people inside the plot."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Moonlight", "Review": "This review was originally published on September 11, during the Toronto International Film Festival. \u201cWho is you, man?\u201d Dramatic film has long been fascinated with issues of identity, but they\u2019ve rarely been explored with the degree of eloquence and heartbreaking beauty as in Barry Jenkins\u2019 masterful \u201cMoonlight,\u201d one of the essential American films of 2016. \u201cMoonlight\u201d is a film that is both lyrical and deeply grounded in its character work, a balancing act that\u2019s breathtaking to behold. It is one of those rare pieces of filmmaking that stays completely focused on its characters while also feeling like it\u2019s dealing with universal themes about identity, sexuality, family, and, most of all, masculinity. And yet it's never preachy or moralizing. It is a movie in which deep, complex themes are reflected through character first and foremost. Jenkins\u2019 film is confident in every single aspect of the way that a critic can use that word. Every performance, every shot choice, every piece of music, every lived-in setting\u2014it\u2019s one of those rare movies that just doesn\u2019t take a wrong step, and climaxes in a scene not of CGI or twists but of dialogue that is one of the best single scenes in years. Advertisement The protagonist of \u201cMoonlight\u201d reflects the conflicted and fluid masculinity of young African-American men in the United States, even in just the way he\u2019s presented. The film is divided into three chapters\u2014\u201cLittle,\u201d \u201cChiron\u201d and \u201cBlack\u201d\u2014the three names used to refer to the same person that we follow from childhood through adolescence to adulthood. He\u2019s a boy and then a man who has trouble figuring out his place in the world, which is also articulated by the character being played by three separate, all-remarkable actors.  The film starts with Chiron as a boy, referred to by his bullies as \u201cLittle\u201d (Alex R. Hibbert). We meet this youngster running, trying to hide in a boarded up apartment from the kids who want to beat him up. Little is found there by Juan (Mahershala Ali, doing career-best work), a local drug dealer. Juan takes the kid out to eat, even bringing him back to his place, where he meets his partner Teresa (Janelle Mon\u00e1e). Little could use this makeshift family. His dad is gone and his mother Paula (Naomie Harris) happens to be one of Juan\u2019s best clients. Juan becomes something of a father figure, but that might make this relationship sound more predictable than it is. Juan sees something good in Chiron and wants to help this quiet boy, even as he provides the product that\u2019s ruining his home life. The film jumps to Chiron as a teenager, dealing with more intense bullying and questions about sexuality. These are the years in which everyone claims to be sleeping around and a young man like Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders) struggles to find himself, especially now that all semblance of a normal home life is gone. He literally has nothing, and it takes kindness from his friend Kevin (played by Jharrel Jerome at this age) to bring him comfort. But even that is turned in a time, place and age in which compassion is sorely lacking, when young men believe that violence is the answer to what will make them feel better or allow them to fit in. Advertisement Finally, we meet Chiron as a young adult, played with remarkable subtlety by Trevante Rhodes. Kevin (now played by Andr\u00e9 Holland of \u201cThe Knick\u201d) reaches out to a very-different Chiron, and the film\u2019s themes coalesce in a surprisingly emotionally resonant way without monologues or heavy-handed melodrama. In a sense, \u201cMoonlight\u201d is a coming-of-age story about a boy often overlooked by society, that little kid not cool enough to hang with the bigger ones and without the support of a family to keep him from simply disappearing into the night.  The trio of performances that make up Chiron from Hibbert/Sanders/Rhodes are perfectly calibrated by Jenkins, who directs them to feel not like imitations of each other but express growth. We can see the sad eyes of Chiron as a boy reflected in Chiron as a man. \u201cMoonlight\u201d could have easily felt episodic, especially with three actors playing the same character, but it\u2019s stunning how much it never falters in that regard. Jenkins\u2019 work with his ensemble creates consistency from chapter to chapter, even as the cast changes as often as it does. Jenkins also draws great turns from Harris and Ali, playing two of the most influential people in Chiron\u2019s life.  Jenkins and his technical team shoot Miami in a way that we don\u2019t often see, using their setting brilliantly, especially the way that the water and the beach around it can feel like a break from the troubles of the real world. But \"Moonlight\" is a film about faces. Chiron\u2019s eyes say so much that this young man has not been taught how to express. He is young, black, gay, poor, and largely friendless\u2014the kind of person who feels like he could literally vanish from being so unseen by the world. During one of the film\u2019s many memorable dialogue exchanges (written by Jenkins, adapted from a play by Tarell McCraney), Chiron speaks of crying so much in his life that he feels like he could simply turn to liquid and roll into the ocean. Advertisement While there\u2019s memorable dialogue in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d it\u2019s what\u2019s unsaid that really resonates. It\u2019s the look of a morally complex father figure when a child asks him why other kids call him a bad word. It\u2019s a nervous glance between two young men who know something is a little different about their relationship but society has given them no words to express it. And it\u2019s in the final scenes of the film\u2014in which Jenkins knows he\u2019s laid the groundwork, trusts his actors and allows the emotions of what\u2019s unsaid to provide the dramatic thrust\u2014that \u201cMoonlight\u201d makes its greatest impact. Jenkins deeply understands that it is human connection that forms us, that changes our trajectory and makes us who we are."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Open Windows", "Review": "Heavily inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's influence on Brian De Palma,\r\nNacho Vigalondo\u2019s \u201cOpen Windows\u201d goes from crazy to Crazy to CRAZY, but\r\nmaintains enough energy and cultural currency to keep the entertainment value\r\nhigh. It\u2019s one of those admittedly silly films that moves so quickly that one rarely has time to\r\nquestion its logic. Consider that a piece of advice. If you think about any of\r\nthe dozen or so twists in \u201cOpen Windows\u201d for even a few seconds, the entire\r\nexercise falls apart. However, there\u2019s enough filmmaking skill and an enticing\r\nmelting pot of commentary on celebrity and hacker culture to keep it humming.\r\nIt\u2019s nonsense, but it\u2019s glorious nonsense. Advertisement Nick Chambers (Elijah Wood) runs a website devoted to his\r\nfavorite starlet, Jill Goddard (Sasha Grey), star of a series of sci-fi action\r\nflicks called \u201cDark Sky.\u201d Jill is appearing at a convention in Austin, where\r\nNick has been told he has won a blogger contest to have dinner with his beloved\r\nactress. Sitting in his hotel room, watching Jill\u2019s latest public appearance\r\nonline, Nick gets a call from a mysterious man named Chord (Neil Maskell). The\r\nman on the other end of the line begins to manipulate Nick, telling him that\r\nJill has canceled their date before giving the fan access to her cell phone.\r\nThey can see and hear Jill\u2019s every action, including breaking up with her actor\r\nboyfriend and going to meet her new beau in the same hotel at which Nick is\r\nstaying. At first, it\u2019s \u201cRear Window\u201d with modern technology\u2014the pane of glass\r\nreplaced by a smartphone, the new way to play peeping tom. The first act feels\r\nlike a clever commentary on how much celebrities \u201cowe us,\u201d especially in the\r\nera of the hacked celebrity photos scandal. Then Nick leaves his room. At the end of the stellar first\r\nact, Nick starts running around the halls with his laptop, playing puppet on a\r\nstring to Chord\u2019s demands and \u201cOpen Windows\u201d goes from thriller to insanity.\r\nDid I mention yet that the whole thing takes place on that laptop screen? Yes,\r\nit\u2019s a series of \u201copen windows,\u201d displaying Nick\u2019s webcam, Jill\u2019s phone cam, a\r\ndashboard cam, etc. It\u2019s a clever concept that threatens to completely\r\ncollapse, especially when Vigalondo tries to stage a car chase with this\r\nstructure, but it never quite does. Again, it\u2019s the kind of thing that if one\r\nquestions with any sort of intensity, their eyes will roll. And yet, thanks in\r\nlarge part to incredibly tight editing by Bernat Vilaplana, I kept my disbelief\r\nsuspended. It\u2019s a gimmick that so openly announces and presents itself that it\u2019s\r\nhard to criticize. As De Palma often did in his crazier moments, it\u2019s a\r\nfilmmaker who knows he\u2019s pushing the boundaries of logic but does so with just\r\nthe right amount of confidence. And \u201cOpen Windows\u201d gets crazier and crazier,\r\nwhich I\u2019ve always considered a positive thing. I have a much bigger problem\r\nwith films that pretend to be extreme than those that go off the rails. \u201cOpen\r\nWindows\u201d flies off the rails of logic in style. Mostly. There could have been a few more believable\r\nreactions by the people involved in this insanity. Nick so openly does whatever\r\nChord says in the first act that it\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019s ever even seen a\r\nmovie much less runs a website devoted to them. (Didn\u2019t he see \u201cGrand Piano,\u201d\r\nanother Wood vehicle from this year that featured a distant tormentor and could\r\nbe called De Palma-esque?) It\u2019s a product of the plot that Nick openly accepts\r\nas much as he does. As is the fact that Jill quickly follows almost every order. They\u2019re\r\ncogs in Vigalondo\u2019s machine as much as Chord\u2019s elaborate plan. Advertisement And yet my problems with the shallow characters of \u201cOpen\r\nWindows\u201d are offset by the tight pacing and, even more than that, the cultural\r\ncommentary for which Vigalondo aims as a writer. He\u2019s playing with the era of anonymity. It\r\nactually makes sense that Nick would be more likely to trust a voice on a\r\nlaptop than it might have ten years ago, given how much we are all living\r\nelectronically. The combination of anonymity on the internet with a complete\r\nlack of privacy in celebrity culture creates a fascinating crossroads in \u201cOpen\r\nWindows.\u201d How many people out there don\u2019t even want to use their real names\r\nonline but expect to know every little detail about their favorite actress?\r\nVigalondo stages the only kind of thriller he could in this pop culture\r\ndichotomy\u2014a crazy one."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Ass Backwards", "Review": "\"Ass Backwards\" takes its title quite literally from the very beginning, matter-of-factly offering us the image of two women from behind, squatting side by side as they relieve themselves in broad daylight, their urine trickling in parallel streams down the sidewalk.  Thankfully, the comedy goes uphill from there\u2014somewhat.  Co-stars, co-writers and longtime collaborators June Diane Raphael and Casey Wilson have chemistry and energy to spare as a pair of bubble-headed best friends stumbling from one scenario to the next. The Upright Citizens Brigade alumnae and college best friends don't have to work to hard to convince us of their connection. It's infectious, and the daffy, breezy way they play off each other makes \"Ass Backwards\" way more enjoyable than it ought to be.  Advertisement Their delightful zaniness remains a constant even when the predicaments their characters find themselves in can be rather hit and miss and often strain for laughs in director Chris Nelson's feature debut.  Raphael and Wilson star respectively as Kate and Chloe, aimless but unflappably upbeat women sharing an apartment in New York City. Pushing 30, they still have no real goals, although they've fashioned pseudo careers for themselves. Kate is an \"entrepreneur\" (she sells her eggs on Craigslist to couples trying to conceive) while Chloe is an \"entertainer\" (she's a listless go-go dancer in a box at a nightclub). They live on maxed-out credit to create the illusion of luxury, hoping to convince both the outside world and themselves that they've really made it. But when Kate and Chloe receive an invitation to return to their hometown to compete in an anniversary edition of the beauty pageant they both lost as young girls\u2014the crucial moment in their childhood that bound and defined them\u2014they can only pretend to be cool about it. The prospect of redeeming themselves is too tantalizing, especially in front of their longtime nemesis, a pageant goddess turned best-selling author (a smarmily condescending Alicia Silverstone).  And the timing is perfect\u2014sort of\u2014because they've just been evicted from their apartment, forcing them to go somewhere. Now. So they load up a rickety van with totally impractical belongings, program the wrong directions into the GPS and hit the road. Their scattered adventures along the way feature a highly symbolic bunny rabbit, a strip contest (where Raphael's real-life husband, Paul Scheer, plays the club manager), a down-and-dirty interlude with a drug-addicted reality TV star (Brian Geraghty) and an overnight visit to a women's commune which (sort of) alters their notions of femininity. As with any kind of episodic or sketch comedy, some gags land more effectively than others, although you'll likely find a line or a beat or an image that makes you laugh from start to finish. Through it all, the actresses seem game for anything, staying completely committed to the delusional characters they've created and reveling not only in their flamboyance but also in their vulnerability. They allow us to genuinely enjoy these women (although spending 85 minutes with them is plenty) while also recognizing their flaws. Advertisement Raphael and Wilson (and Kate and Chloe) owe a great debt to \"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,\" the still-hilarious 1997 comedy that was both silly and sweet and allowed clueless female characters to be ditzy and shallow while remaining true to each other. Despite Raphael and Wilson's fondness for pushing the humor into brash, crass directions (as evidenced by that opening shot), their characters clearly have an innate decency and a loyalty to each other that's heartening.  At the same time, \"Ass Backwards\" is a welcome departure from the script they co-wrote for 2009's \"Bride Wars,\" an ugly example of longtime female friends tearing each other apart for the sake of broad laughs. Even when the cracks in Kate and Chloe's cheery, colorful exterior begin to show, it's clear that they still love each other, and they'll live to shop together another day. Raphael and Wilson's friendship\u2014and their collaborative efforts\u2014are just as promising."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "The Social Network", "Review": "\"The Social Network\" is about a young man who possessed an uncanny ability to look into a system of unlimited possibilities and sense a winning move. His name is Mark Zuckerberg, he created Facebook, he became a billionaire in his early 20s, and he reminds me of the chess prodigy Bobby Fischer. There may be a touch of Asperger's syndrome in both: They possess genius but are tone-deaf in social situations. Example: It is inefficient to seek romance by using strict logic to demonstrate your intellectual arrogance. Advertisement David Fincher's film has the rare quality of being not only as smart as its brilliant hero, but in the same way. It is cocksure, impatient, cold, exciting and instinctively perceptive.  It hurtles through two hours of spellbinding dialogue. It makes an untellable story clear and fascinating. It is said to be impossible to make a movie about a writer, because how can you show him only writing? It must also be impossible to make a movie about a computer programmer, because what is programming but writing in a language few people in the audience know? Yet Fincher and his writer, Aaron Sorkin, are able to explain the Facebook phenomenon in terms we can immediately understand, which is the reason 500 million of us have signed up. To conceive of Facebook, Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) needed to know almost nothing about relationships or human nature (and apparently he didn't). What he needed was the ability to intuit a way to involve the human race in the Kevin Bacon Game. Remember that Kevin Bacon himself need not know more than a fraction of the people linking through him. Same on Facebook. I probably know 40 of my Facebook friends well, 100 glancingly, 200 by reputation. All the others are friends of friends. I can't remember the last time I received a Friend Request from anyone I didn't share at least one \"Mutual Friend\" with.  For the presence of Facebook, we possibly have to thank a woman named Erica (Rooney Mara). \"The Social Network\" begins with Erica's date with Zuckerberg. He nervously sips a beer and speed-talks through an aggressive interrogation. It's an exercise in sadistic conversational gamesmanship. Erica gets fed up, calls him an asshole and walks out. Erica (a fictional character) is right, but at that moment she puts Zuckerberg in business. He goes home, has more beers and starts hacking into the \"facebooks\" of Harvard dorms to collect the head shots of campus women. He programs a page where they can be rated for their beauty. This is sexist and illegal, and proves so popular, it crashes the campus servers. After it's fertilized by a mundane website called \"The Harvard Connection,\" Zuckerberg grows it into Facebook. Advertisement In theory, there are more possible moves on a chess board than molecules in the universe. Chessmasters cannot possibly calculate all of them, but using intuition, they can \"see\" a way through this near-infinity to a winning move. Nobody was ever better at chess than Bobby Fischer. Likewise, programming languages and techniques are widely known, but it was Zuckerberg who intuited how he could link them with a networking site. The genius of Facebook requires not psychological insight but its method of combining ego with interaction. Zuckerberg wanted to get revenge on all the women at Harvard. To do that, he involved them in a matrix that is still growing. It's said there are child prodigies in only three areas: math, music and chess. These non-verbal areas require little maturity or knowledge of human nature, but a quick ability to perceive patterns, logical rules and linkages. I suspect computer programming may be a fourth area.  Zuckerberg may have had the insight that created Facebook, but he didn't do it alone in a room, and the movie gets a narration by cutting between depositions for lawsuits. Along the way, we get insights into the pecking order at Harvard, a campus where ability joins wealth and family as success factors. We meet the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer), rich kids who believe Zuckerberg stole their \"Harvard Connection\" in making Facebook. We meet Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), Zuckerberg's roommate and best (only) friend, who was made CFO of the company, lent it the money that it needed to get started and was frozen out. And most memorably we meet Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the founder of two legendary web startups, Napster and Plaxo.  It is the mercurial Parker, just out of work but basked in fame and past success, who grabbed Zuckerberg by the ears and pulled him into the big time. He explained why Facebook needed to move to Silicon Valley. Why more money would come from venture capitalists than Eduardo would ever raise with his hat-in-hand visits to wealthy New Yorkers. And he tried, not successfully, to introduce Zuckerberg into the fast lane: big offices, wild parties, women, the availability of booze and cocaine.  Zuckerberg was not seduced by his lifestyle. He was uninterested in money, stayed in modest houses, didn't fall into drugs. A subtext the movie never comments on is the omnipresence of attractive Asian women. Most of them are smart Harvard undergrads, two of them (allied with Sean) are Victoria's Secret models, one (Christy, played by Brenda Song) is Eduardo's girlfriend. Zuckerberg himself doesn't have much of a social life onscreen, misses parties, would rather work. He has such tunnel vision he doesn't even register when Sean redrafts the financial arrangements to write himself in and Eduardo out.  Advertisement The testimony in the depositions makes it clear there is a case to be made against Zuckerberg, many of them sins of omission. It's left to the final crawl to explain how they turned out. The point is to show an interaction of undergraduate chaos, enormous amounts of money and manic energy.  In an age when movie dialogue is dumbed and slowed down to suit slow-wits in the audience, the dialogue here has the velocity and snap of screwball comedy. Eisenberg, who has specialized in playing nice or clueless, is a heat-seeking missile in search of his own goals. Timberlake pulls off the tricky assignment of playing Sean Parker as both a hot shot and someone who engages Zuckerberg as an intellectual equal. Andrew Garfield evokes an honest friend who is not the right man to be CFO of the company that took off without him, but deserves sympathy. \"The Social Network\" is a great film not because of its dazzling style or visual cleverness, but because it is splendidly well-made. Despite the baffling complications of computer programming, web strategy and big finance, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay makes it all clear, and we don't follow the story so much as get dragged along behind it. I saw it with an audience that seemed wrapped up in an unusual way: It was very, very interested."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Ex Machina", "Review": "Real science fiction is about ideas, which means that real science fiction is rarely seen on movie screens, a commercially minded canvas that's more at ease with sensation and spectacle. What you more often get from movies is something that could be called \"science fiction-flavored product\"\u2014a work that has a few of the superficial trappings of the genre, such as futuristic production design and somewhat satirical or sociological observations about humanity, but that eventually abandons its pretense for fear of alienating or boring the audience and gives way to more conventional action or horror trappings, forgetting about whatever made it seem unusual to begin with. Advertisement \n \"Ex Machina,\" the directorial debut by novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland (\"28 Days Later,\" \"Sunshine\"), is a rare and welcome exception to that norm. It starts out as an ominous thriller about a young programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) orbiting a charismatic Dr. Frankenstein-type (Oscar Isaac) and slowly learning that the scientist's zeal to create artificial intelligence has a troubling, even sickening personal agenda. But even as the revelations pile up and the screws tighten and you start to sense that terror and violence are inevitable, the movie never loses grip on what it's about; this is a rare commercial film in which every scene, sequence, composition and line deepens the screenplay's themes\u2014which means that when the bloody ending arrives, it seems less predictable than inevitable and right, as in myths, legends and Bible stories.\u00a0 \n The scientist, Isaac's Nathan, has brought the programmer Caleb (Gleason) to his remote home/laboratory in the forested mountains and assigned Caleb to\u00a0interact with a prototype of a \"female\" robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander), to\u00a0determine if she truly has self-awareness or it's just an incredible simulation. The story is\u00a0emotionally and geographically intimate, at times suffocating,\u00a0unfolding in and around Nathan's\u00a0stronghold. This modernist bunker with swingin' bachelor trappings is sealed off from the outside world. Many of its rooms are off-limits to Caleb's restricted key card. The story is circumscribed with the same kind of precision. Caleb's conversations with Ava are presented as discrete narrative sections, titled like chapters in a book (though the claustrophobic setting will inevitably remind viewers of another classic of shut-in psychodrama, Stanley Kubrick's film of\u00a0\"The Shining\"). These sections are interspersed with scenes between Caleb, Nathan, and Nathan's girlfriend (maybe concubine) Kyoko (Sonoya Mizono), a nearly mute, fragile-seeming woman who hovers near the two men in a ghostly fashion.\u00a0 \n Because the film is full of surprises, most of them character-driven and logical in retrospect, I'll try to describe \"Ex Machina\" in general terms. Nathan is an almost satirically specific type: a brilliant man who created a revolutionary new programming code at 13 and went on to found a Google-like corporation, then funneled profits into his secret scheme to create a physically and psychologically credible synthetic person, specifically a woman. This is a classic nerd fantasy, and there is a sense in which \"Ex Machina\" might be described as \"Stanley Kubrick's Weird Science.\"\u00a0 But despite having made a film in which two of the four main characters are women in subservient roles, and making it clear that Nathan's realism test will include a sexual component, the movie never seems to be exploiting the characters or their situations. The movie maintains a scientific detachment even as it brings us inside the minds and hearts of its people, starting with Caleb (an audience surrogate with real personality), then embracing Ava, then Nathan (who's as screwed-up as he is intimidating), then finally Kyoko, who is not the cipher she initially seems to be.\u00a0\r\n Advertisement \n \"Ex Machina\" is a beautiful extension of Garland's past concerns as a screenwriter. Starting with Danny Boyle's \"The Beach,\" based on his novel, and continuing through two more collaborations with Boyle, \"28 Days Later\" and \"Sunshine\" and the remake of \"Judge Dredd,\" Garland has demonstrated great interest in the organization of society, the tension between the need for rules and the abuse of authority, and the way that gender roles handed down over thousands of years can poison otherwise pure relationships. The final section of \"28 Days Later\" is set in a makeshift army base where soldiers have taken up arms against hordes of infected citizens. No sooner have they welcomed the heroes into their fold than they reveal themselves as domineering monsters who want to strip the tomboyish\u00a0women in the group of their autonomy and groom them as\u00a0concubines and breeders in frilly dresses, in a skewed version of \"traditional\" society. The soldiers, not the infected, were the true zombies in that zombie film: the movie was a critique of masculinity, especially the toxic kind. \n Likewise, \"Ex Machina\" is very much about men and women, and how their identities are constructed by male dominated society as much as by biology. Nathan actively rebels against the nerd stereotype, carrying on like a frat house alpha dog, working a heavy bag, drinking to excess, disco dancing with his girl in a robotically choreographed routine,\u00a0addressing the soft-spoken, sensitive\u00a0Caleb as \"dude\" and \"bro\", and reacting with barely disguised contempt when Caleb expresses empathy for Ava. It's bad enough that\u00a0Nathan wants to play God at all, worse still that he longs to re-create femininity through circuitry and artificial flesh. His vision of women seems shaped by lad magazines, video games aimed at eternal teenagers,\u00a0and the most juvenile \"adult\" science fiction and fantasy.\u00a0 \n As Ava becomes increasingly central to the story, the movie acquires an undertone of film noir, with Nathan as the abusive husband or father often found in such movies,\u00a0Caleb as the clueless drifter smitten with her, and Ava as the damsel who is definitely in distress but not as helpless as she first appears (though we are kept guessing as to how capable she is, and whether she has the potential to be a femme fatale). The film's most intense moments are the quiet conversations that occur during power blackouts at the facility, when Ava confesses her terror to Caleb and asks his help against Nathan. We don't know quite how to take her pleas. Despite her limited emotional bandwidth, she seems truly distressed, and yet we are always aware that she is Nathan's creation. Her scenario might be another level in the simulation, or another projection of Nathan's twisted machismo. There is also canny commentary, conveyed entirely through images, which suggests that \"traditional\" femininity is as artificial and blatantly constructed as any android siren, which makes creatures like Ava seem like horribly logical extensions of a mentality that has always existed. (This movie and \"Under the Skin\" would make an excellent double feature,\u00a0though not one that should be watched by anybody prone to depression.) Advertisement \n Throughout, Garland builds tension slowly and carefully without ever letting the pace slacken. And he proves to have a precise but bold eye for composition, emphasizing humans and robots as lovely but troubling figures in a cold, sharp mural of technology. The special effects are some of the best ever done in this genre, so convincing that you soon cease marveling at the way Ava's metallic \"bones\" can be seen through the transparent flesh of her forearms, or the way that her \"face\" is a fixed to a silver skull. \n Garland's screenplay is equally impressive, weaving references to mythology, history, physics, and visual art into casual conversations, in ways that demonstrate that Garland understands what he's talking about while simultaneously going to the trouble to explain more abstract concepts in plain language, to entice rather than alienate casual filmgoers. (Nathan and Caleb's discussion of Jackson Pollock's \"automatic painting\" is a highlight.) The performances are outstanding. Isaac's in particular has an electrifying star quality, cruelly sneering yet somehow delightful, insinuating and intellectually credible.\u00a0The ending, when it arrives, is primordially satisfying, spotlighting images whose caveman savagery is emotionally overwhelming yet earned by the story. This is a classic film."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Time Being", "Review": "Movies use artistic professions as a sort of psychological shorthand. If a character is an actor, he or she is usually neurotic, potentially self-absorbed and probably an alcoholic. Writer characters are always neurotic, preternaturally self-loathing and definitely alcoholics. Musicians are oversexed dopeheads. They\u2019ve got nothing on cinematic painters, who have it worst of all. Not only are they tortured by whatever inner demon speaks through their brushstrokes, they are tormented by the fact that the general public fails to grasp the meanings of their artwork. Their agony stretches from opening to closing credits, and we are supposed to feel blame and sorrow because people just don\u2019t get the artist\u2019s \"genius with a capital G.\" Not once have I ever been affected by this, because it\u2019s a bunch of you-know-what with a capital B and S.  Advertisement With that said, \"The Time Being\" presents us with two painters, one young and one old. The elder man, Warner Dax (Frank Langella) has had some success, but is now a hollow shell of a man. Daniel (Wes Bentley), the younger man, has had no success yet is equally hollow. Their paths cross in what starts as a sinister mystery but ends in a melodramatic slog through standard-issue secrets and lies. \"The Time Being\" also presents a \"spoiler\" that you can easily figure out from the trailer, but of which I am not allowed to speak. This makes me a sad panda, because my biggest problem with \"The Time Being\" is this spoiler, and how useless the film becomes because of it. Rather than blame you for my agony, I\u2019ll just do the writer thing and pour myself another Scotch.  Here's what I can tell you: Before Daniel\u2019s involvement with Dax, he attempts to peddle his artwork at a local gallery. When approached by a potential buyer with questions, Daniel abruptly brushes him off. We are supposed to be on Daniel\u2019s side\u2014that buyer obviously doesn\u2019t get his black and\u00a0 white paintings of rotting fruit\u2014but I didn\u2019t find the guy\u2019s question illogical. Daniel could certainly have pulled some snooty, high-art comment out of his ass (or provided the correct explanation) in order to get his painting sold. But no, he has to be difficult because he\u2019s an \"ar-TEEST.\" Ruth Brown once sang that if she couldn't sell it, she was going to sit on it. With Daniel\u2019s attitude, he winds up sitting on all his paintings except one.   An agent for Warner Dax buys that painting, but the purchaser has ulterior motives. Dax is dying, and since he can no longer leave the house, he hires Daniel for a series of increasingly creepy video camera surveillance jobs. Dax is extremely precise about when and where Daniel should record the footage, and will pay $1,000 for each job. Daniel needs the money to support his wife and young son, so he takes the job. He hopes the extra money will keep his willing wife from taking a job to keep the family financially afloat.  Advertisement Daniel is first asked to shoot a sunrise, then to shoot a museum tour, a sunset, and a playground full of children. That last one is a major red flag-raiser, and to the film's credit, Daniel objects. \"I ask you to record a bunch of children playing on a jungle gym, and suddenly I'm some kind of pervert?\" screams Dax. Well, yeah dude. Daniel shoots the footage anyway.  Daniel's suspicions continue to rise when he encounters the same woman at multiple Dax-requested video locations. The suspicions reach fever pitch when Daniel finds that Dax has an entire file on him, including his credit report and pictures of his wife and kid. The score ominously portends doom under each of these events. Daniel does some investigating and finds out that spoiler I can't reveal. This should be the climax of the movie, but instead, \"The Time Being\" suddenly turns into a mentor-student melodrama. The mystery elements are basically forgotten in favor of Daniel's spiritual rebirth, or something like that.   \"Artists don't have families,\" says Warner icily. I erroneously thought this was the theme of \"The Time Being,\" but it is just another element to pad the film's running time. Both Warner and Daniel are in varying degrees of estrangement from their families; Warner has severed all ties and Daniel's dreary, sexist attitude causes his wife and kid to move out. This estrangement seems to get the artistic juices flowing for both men. Daniel looks at Warner's paintings and is inspired to add sellable features like color and naked ass to his canvas. Warner uses Daniel's shot footage to paint what's supposed to be the emotional masterpiece of \"The Time Being.\" Instead, when Warner's big secret sees the painting, the screen fills with crocodile tears and stilted emotion.  Director Nenad Cicin-Sain and co-writer Richard N. Gladstein are both guilty of serving up a totally empty, tonally confused meditation on the creative process. Cicin-Sain aims for importance with a capital I by filling the screen with close-ups of Wes Bentley's irises and paintbrushes swirling in water. The gorgeous, tactile quality of the images, shot by Mihai Malaimare Jr., override their pretention, but putting a\u00a0 video camera in Bentley\u2019s hands while he stares longingly at mundane objects evokes enormous swatches of Sam Mendes's \"American Beauty.\"  Advertisement The actors try their best. As Daniel's frustrated wife, Ahna O\u2019Reilly has an excellent scene of anger. As Daniel's kid, Marco, Aiden Lovekamp sweetly portrays his longing for fatherly attention in his few scenes. Langella's character is practically useless, but he\u2019s game for scenes both quiet and operatic. Bentley plays the blank canvas upon which we are to paint our response. He stayed without a brushstroke of color for\u00a0 me.  I'm awarding an extra half a star for Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's overactive score, which evokes all manner of dread and conflict while absolutely nothing happens onscreen. It feels so out of place that it's actually quite subversive. Imagine the most overdone, Philip Glass-style horror movie music playing over glossy footage of a university art class, and you have some idea what your eyes and ears are in for while attending \"The Time Being.\""}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)", "Review": "Of the many human characteristics keenly observed in \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),\u201d the most powerful is the lonely sense of being the\u00a0only\u00a0something in one\u2019s family. The\u00a0only\u00a0failure, the\u00a0only\u00a0daughter, the\u00a0only\u00a0one with no artistic talent\u2014these are traits that, whether incontrovertible or questionable, are clutched like well-earned badges of honor by the Meyerowitz brood. The siblings fling their Purple Hearts with reckless abandon, sometimes to curry favor and other times to wound. These battles play out for the benefit of a father who, as the children should know by now, is too self-absorbed to really take notice. But a win, no matter how Pyrrhic, is still a win. In the never-ending battle of the sibling, the stats matter. Advertisement Dustin Hoffman plays Harold Meyerowitz, the family patriarch whose multiple marriages produced three children, Jean (Elizabeth Marvel), Matthew (Ben Stiller) and Danny (Adam Sandler). Like Gene Hackman\u2019s Royal in Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums,\u201d Harold possesses a charm that draws people toward him before his dark side keeps them at bay. Hoffman adds another layer to this familiar archetype, a comic brittleness that pricks the viewer like a cactus touching a balloon. No other actor is more masterful at conveying this kind of aggravating self-righteousness, whether aggressively or passively, than Hoffman. With Harold, everyone else\u2019s feelings are secondary or non-existent, and in the rare moments he\u2019s completely present and on your side, it still feels as if he\u2019s there under duress. It\u2019s no wonder Harold\u2019s children have issues. We first meet Danny, who is trying to find a parking space in the no-parking wonderland that is the East Village. Danny\u2019s college-age daughter Eliza (Grace van Patten) has accompanied him on this visit to her grandparents\u2019 house. This father-daughter relationship is far cozier than the one Jean has with Harold; Danny seems to be a self-consciously less antagonistic parent. The duo bond over a song on the radio and commiserate about the obnoxious New York drivers whose impatience keep wrecking Danny\u2019s parking opportunities. Later, we\u2019ll see that Eliza also has a good relationship with her uncle and especially her aunt. Danny\u2019s opening vignette sets the pattern for how \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d will operate. A title card appears, then a scene builds to a crescendo before abruptly being cut off by another segment. Some of the cuts are hilariously rendered, others feel like interruptions in one\u2019s train of thought. But the gimmick is always well-executed and suggests that we\u2019re privy to several interconnected short stories being told to us by writer/director Noah Baumbach. We learn that Harold has had some modicum of success as a sculptor, though lately he hasn\u2019t been as prolific as he was in his youth. Though a self-proclaimed failure, Danny appears to be the only one of his children who inherited some form of artistic creativity. He\u2019s a songwriter who plays piano. Danny sings two songs written by Sandler, Baumbach and Randy Newman, who also provides the score. One of the songs is a lovely ditty about the relationship between Danny and Eliza. The other pokes fun at a faux pas Harold committed at one of his art shows. Coincidentally, Harold\u2019s old university wants to put on a show featuring his sculptures\u2014a move championed by Danny\u2014but Harold doesn\u2019t want to share the spotlight. Advertisement After introducing Danny and briefly highlighting his struggles with Harold, \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d pivots to Danny\u2019s half-brother, Matthew. He\u2019s only mentioned in passing in Danny\u2019s first vignette, and he gets his own set of scenes with Harold before the film merges their plotlines. Unlike Danny, Matthew was no good at anything arty and instead has become a very powerful, very successful financial planner. Matthew ran for the shores of Los Angeles as soon as he could, and didn\u2019t look back. When \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d takes Harold temporarily out of the picture due to a health scare, a deeper antagonism is revealed between Matthew and Danny. Matthew wants to sell Harold\u2019s current house, a house Danny is attached to despite the fact he did not grow up there. Danny is angry at his brother for leaving. As the two battle for control and the audience\u2019s sympathy, Baumbach reveals several symbolic comparisons between the two men: Danny has a bum leg but Matthew\u2019s neuroses are just as crippling. Matthew is rich and miserable while Danny is a failure but can at least find a ray of sunshine in his daughter. Eventually, the brothers come to blows in a wrestling match that\u2019s so garish and true-to-life it will immediately conjure up memories for any guy who has a brother. Observing all this, and occasionally contributing to the story, is Jean. The way \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d often demotes its funniest character to the sideline is a calculated, though not always successful, attempt at portraying Jean\u2019s odd-man-out status as the only daughter in the Meyerowitz clan. She and Emma Thompson, as Harold\u2019s hippie-ish drunk of a fourth wife, get some of the biggest laughs but still feel underutilized. Baumbach almost makes it up to Marvel when Jean finally gets her own title card and story, the result of which pulls the siblings together in an act of childish mischief disguised as revenge. It\u2019s not enough, however; Marvel is so good in the role that one longs for a lot more of her. Unlike his prior work, Baumbach is surprisingly humane here. He beats up on his characters, but he also gives them a salve to help heal the wounds. His charity extends to minor characters like Harold\u2019s more successful rival (Judd Hirsch in an endearing cameo) and Harold\u2019s first wife, (Candice Bergen, who gets a great monologue). Baumbach has also finally written a role for Stiller that doesn\u2019t inspire outright hatred. But \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d shockingly belongs to Sandler, who is absolutely fantastic. Advertisement Sandler finds the perfect line between tragedy and comedy for Danny. He still does his hollering angry man-child shtick, but here it stems organically from the character and is never used as a comedic crutch. Additionally, he shades his performance with subtleties both physical and verbal. Some of his best moments involve just a facial gesture or a well-placed pause. His interactions with the other characters are rife with complex emotions unlike any he\u2019s played before. Exasperation, joy and forgiveness flow through him in perfectly calibrated measures. It\u2019s a rich, surprising performance. With its often overwhelming familiarity, the subgenre of dysfunctional family dramedies has negated Tolstoy\u2019s notion that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. While \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d is yet another one of these movies, it does manage to circumvent some of the more predictable clich\u00e9s. It also manages to succeed when it occasionally succumbs to them. This is one of the year\u2019s best movies."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Austin Found", "Review": "\"Austin Found\" is an exercise in deja vu. The story\u2014an ambitious stage-mom goes to criminal lengths to get publicity for her beauty pageant contestant daughter\u2014takes place on too-familiar ground. The characters, for the most part, are all broad types, which wouldn't necessarily be an issue if the film didn't call to mind so many other stories, from real-life (the murder of poor JonBenet Ramsey, HBO's documentary \"Living Dolls\") to reality TV (\"Toddlers & Tiaras,\" \"Dance Moms\") to TV movies (\"The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom\") to feature films (\"Fargo,\" primarily). Directed by Will Raee, who co-wrote the script with Brenna Graziano, \"Austin Found\" features a great ensemble cast, but never manages to explore unique territory. Advertisement Leanne (Linda Cardellini, of \"Freaks and Geeks,\" \"Bloodline,\" and a wonderful arc on \"Mad Men\" as Don Draper's downstairs neighbor and paramour) is ambitious for her 11-year-old daughter Patty to be a star on the kiddie beauty pageant circuit. Patty, played by Ursula Parker as a spikily rebellious and intelligent child, has no interest, and makes a ringing speech at one pageant bemoaning the focus on outer appearance in our culture. Leanne is furious. Bored in her marriage to a weak man who can't stand up to her (Jon Daly), she obsesses on another beauty pageant family whose daughter was kidnapped and then returned: the family got a multi-million dollar book/movie deal out of it, and so Leanne decides to stage a kidnapping, hoping that the resultant publicity will bring her daughter (but mostly her) fame and fortune. Enter Billy Fontaine (Skeet Ulrich), Leanne's boyfriend from high school, now an ex-con who works in an autobody shop. In femme fatale mode, Leanne visits Billy, and gets him on board by painting herself as a damsel in distress. Billy ropes in his ex-con buddy, J.T. (Craig Robinson), and the two of them, tricked up in ski masks, \"break into\" the home and carry the sleeping Patty out to J.T.'s isolated cabin. Leanne \"discovers\" the disappearance the following morning and police and the press descend on the home. Leanne is in her glory, giving tearful interviews, wearing tight clothing and stripper heels. Nancy, a local TV reporter (Kristen Schaal), assigned to the case, was bullied by Leanne in high school. She squints at Leanne's tears with personal and journalistic skepticism. The one aspect in the entire apparatus that stands out as specific enough to hold interest all on its own is the surprisingly sweet bond that develops between J.T. and Patty, the child he has \"kidnapped.\" Wearing a terrifying mask to hide his identity, he makes her pancakes, they talk about music, they play video games. Robinson is such a welcome presence in anything, and here he plays the only adult with a moral compass in a 20-mile radius. The scenes between Robinson and Parker are quiet and sweet, filled with little surprises, small moments of tenderness and communication. They \"recognize\" one another as kindred spirits. It's an Eden, those small scenes. Advertisement Linda Cardellini played Kristen Wiig's sidekick in the hugely underrated \"Welcome to Me,\" and in \"Austin Found\" she plays the \"Kristen Wiig role,\" one of those women with a totally undeveloped psychology, where the entire world is a mirror\u2014for good or ill. Leanne's only desire is to be reflected in a way that she thinks she deserves. It's fun to see Cardellini take center stage here. \"Austin Found\" is filled with actors it's always good to see: Cardellini, Robinson, Patrick Warburton, who shows up as the police chief, his performance a lampoon of vanity from beginning to end. It's really good to see Skeet Ulrich again, an actor prepped to be the \"new Johnny Depp\" back in the mid-'90s, but now that he's lost the boy-band looks, he's leaner, meaner. Jaime Pressly is terrific in her one scene as a woman who has it all, the kind of woman Leanne despises. Kristen Schaal is such a funny presence, but she's mostly underused here as the roving \"girl reporter.\" In some ways, \"Austin Found\" is about people for whom high school never really ended. Billy Fontaine is still in a rage about Leanne breaking up with him in high school. Leanne was one of those people who \"peaked\" at 17, and life has been a disappointment ever since. Nancy still hates Leanne for the bullying in high school. High school betrayals and disappointments and cruelty run the show for these people, still. It's interesting, but it's not really developed. Except for the Eden in the cabin, we've seen it all before."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Small Town Crime", "Review": "It sure would be nice if a filmmaker could actually come up with a consistently good hard-boiled vehicle for John Hawkes. Hawkes is a whippet-thin man with dark hair that sometime flops over his forehead, the better to frame a hawk-like nose. Not a bulky tough guy, more like a strong but flexible short-end of wire. His natural screen presence is more than complemented by his acting chops, which are briefly but revealingly on display in the current awards-season favorite \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d in which he plays the ex-husband of Frances McDormand\u2019s miserablist avenger mom, a physically abusive creep who, unlike most such sorts in real life, can deliver some real verbal zingers with minimal prompting. Hawkes makes this implausible character not only credible but also strangely ingratiating.\u00a0 Advertisement In the tricksy but not wholly successful 2016 post-noir thriller \u201cToo Late,\u201d Hawkes played a detective whose tragedy was revealed in a series of five unbroken long takes, each one taking place in a discrete block of time, and these blocks were not presented in chronological order. Like I said, tricksy, but sometimes compelling, because Hawkes himself is compelling. In \u201cSmall Town Crime,\u201d the tragedy of his character Mike Kendall is spelled out right away, courtesy of an old Animals\u2019 tune and the sight of his souped-up, matte-black Chevy Nova hotrod parked on the lawn of his house, the fence of which is down. Ignominiously fired ex-police officer Kendall is a raging alcoholic prone to blackouts and jaw-droppingly nonchalant about driving drunk. \u201cYou wrap your car around a tree, I\u2019m not gonna feel guilty!\u201d his best friend and brother-in-law Teddy (Anthony Anderson) shouts after they both get thrown out of their favorite bar. \u201cNeither am I!\u201d Mike gleefully responds. The next morning, having driven into an off-road field, Mike is disturbed by the sight of a brutally beat-up body. He drives the still-alive young woman to a hospital, and is given a good talking to by a couple of ex-colleague detectives. Mike\u2019s still hoping to get on the force, and these guys don\u2019t think so. When the young woman dies, Mike sees a shot at redemption and invents a new identity for himself as a private detective.\u00a0 Tooling around in a cheap black suit and putting out a line of poorly improvised patter, Mike nonetheless earns the trust of the victim\u2019s grandfather, who\u2019s still bitter about all the heartache she caused her family\u2014at time of death she was a drug-addicted prostitute\u2014but game to get some payback, no doubt in part because he\u2019s played by Robert Forster and characters played by Robert Forster tend to have these attitudes. Soon Mike is playing cat and mouse with an eccentric pimp named Mood (Clifton Collins, Jr., having some outlandish fun), a bar keep who\u2019s turned his establishment into a brothel, and other unsavory characters, while enduring the loving disapprobation of his adoptive sister (Octavia Spencer), who\u2019s married to Teddy. Written and directed by the brother team of Eshom and Ian Nelms, \u201cSmall Town Crime\u201d sounds like the kind of movie at least one other brother team could conceivably make, and also like a potentially fun picture. I wish it had been a lot more fun, frankly. The movie\u2019s tone never quite gels; it\u2019s too outlandish and cartoony to convince, but not so outlandish and cartoony that it takes off into a realm of over-the-top exhilaration. The score, by Chris Westlake, sounds rather like a tribute to Stephen J. Cannell, and there are times when you feel the filmmakers trying to wed Cannell\u2019s unabashed cheesiness with a sardonicism that isn\u2019t quite as cerebral as that of the Coen Brothers\u2019. The grisly killings are a little too pleased with their mercilessness, too. \"Small Town Crime\"\u00a0is brisk enough that it\u2019s not torture to roll with its inconsistencies and feckless creative decisions, but Hawkes is the only thing that really holds it together. He deserves better. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Inkheart", "Review": "I never knew reading was so dangerous. No child seeing \"Inkheart\" will ever want to be read to again, especially if that child loves its mother, as so many do. Here is a film about a man named Mo, who, when he reads aloud, has the power of liberating fictional characters into the real world. The drawback is that real people are trapped within the same book. Tit for tat. A law of physics must apply. The film opens with its best scene, for me, anyway: the professional book buyer Mo (Brendan Fraser) and Meggie, his 12-year-old daughter (Eliza Hope Bennett), poking through an open-air book market. As always I was trying to read the titles on the spines. Not realizing that \"Inkheart\" is based on a famous fantasy novel, I had the foolish hope the movie might be about books. No luck. Wait till you hear what it's about. Advertisement At the edge of the market is a dark little bookstore presided over by a dark little man. As Mo prowls its aisles, he hears the faint chatter of fictional characters calling to him. (Dictionaries must be almost impossible to shut up.) Sixth sense leads him to discover, on an obscure shelf, the novel Inkheart, in the format of a Penguin mystery from the 1950s. He buys it, slips it into his pocket, and the two of them are followed by a mysterious, skulking man. We discover this is the very book Mo was reading when his wife, Meggie's mother (Sienna Guillory), was sucked into its pages, and that is the true story, Meggie, of how your mom suddenly disappeared when you were little. Yeah, right, dad. At the same time, various demonic creatures were liberated from the book's pages. They have now set up shop in a mountaintop castle and are conspiring to command Mo's power now that he has discovered their book again. Do they want to return to its pages, or be reunited with old chums in the real world? And how do you get a mortgage to buy a castle when you're a demonic creature and your resume mentions only fictional adventures in an out-of-print book? The banks must have been lending carelessly there a while back. Mo and Meggie take refuge in a cliffside mansion occupied by her great-aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren). Mansion? Looks to me like a dreamy tourist hotel from a Merchant-Ivory production. Elinor is a nasty scold who always wears a turban, the reliable standby of the actress tired of having her hair fussed over every second. I hope good Dame Helen passed this tip along to young Eliza Hope Bennett, who shows every sign of becoming an accomplished actress. The movie now descends into the realm of your basic good guys vs. wrathful wraiths formula, with pitched battles and skullduggery. The villains are Dustfinger (Paul Bettany) and the ambitious Capricorn (Andy Serkis), and there is always the threat of Mo and Meggie being transmogrified into the pages of the book. There they'd at least have the company of the missing mom, and the shabby author Fenoglio (Jim Broadbent), who wrote the novel within Inkheart, and apparently was only set free to rise up one level, to the novel containing his novel. Thanks for nothing. Lots of screams, horrible fates almost happening, close scrapes, cries for help, special effects, monomania, quick thinking, pluck, fear and scrambling. You know the kinds of stuff. I learn there are two more novels in this series by Cornelia Funke, both of which will remain just as unread by me as the first. It is hard to guess what they will involve, however, because this one closes with a curiously cobbled-together ending that seems to solve everything, possibly as a talisman against a sequel.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "A Man Called Ove", "Review": "\u201cA Man Called Ove\u201d tells the familiar story of the curmudgeonly old man whose grumpy life is brightened by forces beyond his control. These forces take the guise of a much younger person who provides a sense of purpose for the old hero. A film like this rises or falls not only with its central performance, but also with its ability to engage the viewer\u2019s emotions in a credible, honest fashion. Movies like this tend to get dismissed as \u201cmanipulative\u201d because audience sympathy for the protagonist is at least partially elicited by flashbacks to a litany of tragic or unfair past events.\u00a0But all movies are manipulative by default; the effectiveness of that manipulation is the more valid measurement to inspect. On that scale, \u201cA Man Called Ove\u201d is a morbidly funny and moving success. Advertisement Adapting Frederick Backman\u2019s Swedish best seller, writer/director Hannes Holm doesn\u2019t veer too far from the storytelling structure we\u2019ve come to expect. Instead, he tweaks expectations with the way he presents the material, and his grip on the film\u2019s tricky, tragicomic tone is masterful. For example, several flashbacks are cleverly presented as the \u201clife flashing before one\u2019s eyes\u201d moments triggered by the suicide attempts of Ove (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd). Ove is a widower whose daily visits to his recently deceased wife\u2019s gravesite end with his verbal promise to join her in the afterlife. His failures of self-annihilation are due more to bad timing than botched attempts\u2014he is constantly interrupted by neighbors or some distracting event going on in his housing complex. Priding himself on his reliability, Ove feels compelled to stop killing himself to address each interruption. Keep in mind that the black humor in this situation doesn\u2019t arise from any mockery of Ove\u2019s pain over missing his spouse. That is presented as real, understandable pain. Instead, the humor comes from Ove\u2019s stubbornness as a creature of habit. Perpetually enforcing neighborhood rules nobody cares about nor adheres to, Ove can\u2019t resist the opportunity to scold those who violate them. Yet, for all his crabbiness, there\u2019s a level of selflessness inherent in Ove\u2019s character, a trait he finds infuriating yet he begrudgingly accepts. His wife, Sonja, played as a young woman in the flashbacks by Ida Engvoll, sees this in the younger version of Ove (Filip Berg), and the much older Ove acknowledges it after much bitching and griping. It\u2019s almost as if Sonja is sending him interruptions from beyond the grave just so he can have an excuse to complain to her like he\u2019s done every day since her passing. This compulsive adherence to routine will keep Ove distracted. Also distracting Ove is the new, young family who moves next door to him. They start off on the wrong foot by crushing his mailbox while ignoring his sign about not driving in the area, and the noise from their young kids is a major annoyance to the childless Ove. Though the husband is originally from the area, his pregnant wife Parvaneh (Bahar Pars) is of Iranian descent and new to the country. It is she who constantly irritates Ove while simultaneously endearing herself and her family to him. Many of his suicide attempts are interrupted by her, and their eventual father-daughter style bond is often predicated on Ove\u2019s opinion that his help is required because he thinks her husband is an idiot. Advertisement \u201cYou survived struggle in Iran, moving here and learning a new language, and being married to that idiot,\u201d Ove tells her after taking up the task of her driving instructor, \u201cdriving a car should be no problem!\u201d Of course, she can\u2019t drive it wherever Ove has those \u201cno driving\u201d signs everybody else ignores. Admittedly, \u201cA Man Called Ove\u201d throws everything but the kitchen sink at poor Ove. There\u2019s a shocking death early on that haunts him (and us), and he is the recipient of several slights by higher ups at work and in the government. The marriage between the shy Ove and the jovial Sonja is full of love but fraught with personal tragedies. There\u2019s an almost Job-like mercilessness to some of the fates that befall him, yet the film never dwells on them. Instead, they\u2019re presented rather stoically and serve as a means for us to understand why Ove is who he is. This is a movie that softens its hero by giving him a cat, which sounds syrupy until you see how jacked up and scraggly this cat is. \u201cHe likes to shit in private,\u201d says Ove to Parvaneh. \u201cPlease give him that courtesy.\u201d One gets the sense that the novel (and the award-winning film version) is so beloved because Ove represents a Scandinavian everyman who saunters on no matter what life throws at him. His admirable resilience toughens like leather, and his love of Saab and hatred of Volvo plays like a beautiful in-joke aimed straight at the hearts of his compatriots. That rivalry even costs him a friendship, though that same friend\u2019s subplot also presents Ove angrily battling the unfeeling agents of bureaucracy that caused him such agony as a young man. Holm pulls everything together in a well-crafted, satisfying package that is nicely balanced between comedy and pathos. As Ove, Lassg\u00e5rd gives one of the year\u2019s best performances. He\u2019s well supported by the other actors (and the aforementioned cat), but this is a rich, complex performance that is both funny and moving. It would have been easy to just let Ove coast by on his amusing grouchiness, but Lassg\u00e5rd lets us see so deeply under that protective exterior. We feel as if we\u2019ve walked a mile in Ove\u2019s shoes and absorbed his catharsis as our own."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Abortion: Stories Women Tell", "Review": "Watching HBO\u2019s \u201cAbortion:\r\nStories Women Tell,\u201d which gets a limited theatrical release this week before an\r\nairing on the network, I was struck by how many documentaries on the subject I\u2019ve\r\nseen in just the last few years. And I was struck even more by the variety in\r\ntheir approach: \u201cTrapped\u201d focuses on the laws that are essentially making\r\nabortion illegal in several states; The excellent \u201cAfter Tiller\u201d looks at the\r\nfew doctors left willing to perform third-trimester abortions and the danger\r\nthey face to do what they think is right. \u201cAbortion: Stories Women Tell\u201d has a clear focus that's right there in its title: approaching the subject from the women with\r\nfirst-hand experience. In an interesting twist, director Tracy Droz Tragos\r\ndoesn\u2019t only speak to the women who have chosen to have abortions but people\r\nlike the security guard at the clinic (nicknamed Chi Chi because she\u2019s small\r\nand feisty like a Chihuahua) and even those on the other side of the issue,\r\nincluding prominent female voices in the pro-life organization 40 Days For\r\nLife. But what\u2019s essential about Tragos\u2019 film is that the male voices we hear\r\nare almost exclusively on the fringe: men in the parking lot of a clinic\r\nyelling about Jesus or lawmakers trying to essentially subvert Roe v. Wade.\r\nThis is an issue about women\u2019s rights and so this powerful film exclusively listens to the stories\r\nthat women tell.\u00a0 Advertisement Some of those stories\r\nare among the most resonant I\u2019ve heard in a documentary this year. Particularly\r\nmemorable is the tale of Amie, a young woman who simply can\u2019t afford to have another baby\r\nas she already works multiple jobs to keep her child fed as it is. Several of\r\nthe people we meet in \u201cAbortion: Stories Women Tell\u201d are in this situation:\r\nknowing that their family will go hungry if there\u2019s another mouth to feed.\r\nOthers are in that tragic position in which they\u2019ve learned that their\r\nbaby won\u2019t survive after birth. Others are in abusive relationships. A\r\nwoman tells a heartbreaking tale of being with such an abusive partner that she\r\nknew bringing a baby into the situation would only put her child\u2019s safety at\r\nrisk. It\u2019s important to realize, although Tragos doesn\u2019t underline this fact,\r\nthat every story is different. Money, health, abuse\u2014everyone has a reason, and\r\ndespite what pro-life proponents would have you believe, none of those reasons\r\nfeel poorly-considered. \u201cAbortion: Stories Women\r\nTell\u201d takes an interesting turn when it crosses the aisle, presenting\r\ninterviews with people trying to shut down clinics in Missouri (which they have\r\nessentially done, sending women who need abortions over state lines to the more\r\nlenient Illinois). Tragos\u2019 allegiance is clear, but these films often falter\r\nwhen they demonize the opponent, and hearing a woman honestly speak about how\r\nshe believes she\u2019s saving lives when she protests abortion clinics highlights\r\nthe complexity of the issue. She doesn\u2019t have any doubt that\r\nwhat she\u2019s doing is right. And Tragos\u2019 film is at its best when it\u2019s interested\r\nin commonality. There\u2019s a great moment in which a woman who works at the\r\nIllinois clinic where most of the film takes place sings along to protestors\r\nwith \u201cJesus Loves Me.\u201d One of the last lines of the film is \u201cDo what you think\r\nis right.\u201d So many people involved with the war for the right to legal and safe\r\nabortions and those against them are\r\ndoing what they think is right. While \u201cAbortion: Stories\r\nWomen Tell\u201d strengthens its clear pro-choice stance by allowing the other side\r\nsome time in front of the camera, it is not an overtly political film. We learn\r\nabout the dynamic along this Midwestern border, in which one state has TRAP laws so tough that it pushes women in need to another, and that naturally\r\ncarries some political baggage, but it is the women and their stories that\r\nmatter. It is the faces, particularly Amie\u2019s incredible courage and humanity to\r\nlet us share a very difficult journey with her, that people will remember. And\r\nthat\u2019s why these films keep getting made, and keep mattering to viewers. As people\r\ndebate the issue in presidential campaigns, it is the world of the documentary\r\nthat reminds us what this issue is really about: Women. Listen to their stories. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Final Portrait", "Review": "The writer James Lord was a chronicler of 20th\u00a0century art who not infrequently befriended the artists he wrote about. In 1964, in Paris, the sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti asked Lord to sit for a portrait. What the artist had originally pitched as a day\u2019s work wound up taking almost three weeks. Not an eternity by any stretch of the imagination, but an inconvenience, and a meaty experience, one out of which Lord forged a memoir entitled \u201cA Giacometti Portrait.\u201d \u201cFinal Portrait\u201d is\u00a0an adaptation of that memoir written and directed by Stanley Tucci. Like a couple of other directorial efforts from Tucci, who\u2019s primarily known as an actor, this is a picture about process. His 1996 \u201cBig Night\u201d is the story of the making of an epic meal; 2000\u2019s \u201cJoe Gould\u2019s Secret\u201d is a dual portrait of two writers with very different approaches to work (and very different results).    Advertisement Giacometti, a self-described \u201cItalian Swiss\u201d now ensconced in a ramshackle mini-compound containing studio and living quarters in Paris, is played with shambolic gruffness by Geoffrey Rush. Armie Hammer\u2019s straight-standing, composed James Lord seems the artist\u2019s polar opposite, but the two have a kinship\u2014Lord has a deep understanding of Giacometti\u2019s artistic language.    Still, the artist\u2019s relentless self-doubt puzzles Lord. Lord protests that Giacometti\u2019s success ought to have erased that. Quite the contrary, the artist observes: \u201cWhat better breeding ground for self-doubt than success?\u201d The trappings of success mean little to him, either. He makes millions of francs in sales, but almost literally throws it away; what he doesn\u2019t, he hides in various nook of his studio.    As Alberto begins, erases, and again begins the portrait, James interrogates not just the artist but his brother and assistant Diego (Tony Shalhoub), his dutiful, very drawn-looking wife Annette (Sylvie Testud). Another presence is Caroline (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy), a local prostitute with whom the artist is highly invested, to the point of buying her a sporty new BMW.    The movie is a minimally lovely treat to look at. Tucci and cinematographer Danny Cohen desaturate the colors at the beginning, giving the movie a black-and-slate-gray look from which blues and reds try to fight their way into the viewer\u2019s perception. The evening scenes, many of them spent at Giacometti\u2019s local, Caf\u00e9 Adrien, have a golden warmth. The mobile camera, which on occasion becomes a trifle too shaky, negotiates the artist\u2019s studio with a crafty curiosity.    This movie is a chamber piece, and even at its modest 90-minute running time, it gets a trifle repetitious\u2014Alberto picks up the brush again, James sits down, the camera produces a series of extreme close-ups of James\u2019 face (it\u2019s the head that the artist has the most trouble with). It\u2019s a nice face, with excellent pores, but, you know. Still, the depictions of artistic struggle and mania, the communication of the artist\u2019s frequently painful bubble, are insightful and rewarding. The warts-and-all depiction of Giacometti, which establishes a credible explanation if not excuse for the many selfish acts he\u2019s seen doing, winds up being an apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.\u00a0  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Newlyweds", "Review": "Edward Burns' \"Newlyweds,\" I learn from Variety, played at the Tribeca Film Festival and is a \"$9,000-budgeted comic love letter to that Gotham neighborhood, hastily assembled expressly for the fest.\" I don't ordinarily mention the budgets of low-priced films because that can unfairly diminish their worth, but if there was ever a $9,000 movie hastily assembled for a fest, this is it. That means it has both the charms and the shortcomings of the indie fringe. Although a great deal happens in the lives of its characters, it often seems hasty and perfunctory, as if we are being urged ahead by an invisible production schedule. The performances rely on the considerable charm and presence of the actors, who are working with improvised dialogue that has been worked with but not polished.  Advertisement It begins like some Woody Allen film, with two couples having a meal in a Manhattan eatery. Their dialogue is not up to Allen's standards, nor is their intrinsic interest, but here they are: Buzzy (Burns) and Katie (Caitlin Fitzgerald), near the beginning of their second marriages, and Marsha (Marsha Dietlein) and her husband, Max (Max Baker), who are in the 18th year of their marriage. Marsha is Katie's older sister.  Buzzy and Katie explain that they have the ideal \"set-up.\" He works days, she works nights, and they only see each other on weekends. Although this description is accompanied by a lot of affection and smiling, I dunno. The advantage of their set-up, they reason, is that they don't get on each other's nerves, which sounds to me like an ominous hint that the possibility exists. Marsha and Max have not a set-up but a long-running status quo and a son now safely away in college. Katie owns a successful restaurant. Buzzy is a personal trainer in a \"gym\" so small it looks suspiciously like someone's personal exercise room. She has the money. One day a bomb drops into the middle of their set-up, in the form of Buzzy's half-sister, Linda (Kerry Bishe), who he hasn't seen since she ran away to Los Angeles at 16. As he observes, the prospects aren't favorable for 16-year-old runaways. She plans to move in. Linda is a ditzy blond with a shaky grasp on reality and personal property. She has arrived in New York in winter without a coat, borrows Katie's expensive designer coat and \"forgets\" it somewhere. Her purpose for the visit is to ring up Miles (Johnny Solo), an old boyfriend who she has now decided to marry. This despite the fact that he is a newlywed \u2014 although none too solidly, it appears. The function of Linda is to put the marriage of Buzzy and Katie to a severe test, which she does with an array of bizarre behavior. In the meantime, the contentious regular dinners of the foursome in the opening scene lead drive a wedge into the stability of Marsha and Max's union. Events lead to Marsha's desire to move in with Buzzy and Katie, so that each might have a sister in residence. Adult siblings living under the same roof is a subject that has involved Burns since his well-regarded first film, \"The Brothers McMullen\" (1995). Advertisement All this develops in a series of conversations between various combinations of the characters, who after a scene, may begin speaking directly to camera in docudrama style. This feels like test footage from an earlier stage of the same film, although I have little doubt it was intended for this one. The insights of the direct speech aren't especially useful. Burns deserves credit for persisting in ambitious low-budget indie projects. Issues involving siblings seem to tug at him, and \"Newlyweds,\" like \"The Brothers McMullen,\" also involves issues of morality. This is an honorable film, and Kerry Bishe's performance in particular is winning. But it plays more like a rehearsal than an opening night. As Gene Siskel once told a filmmaker who mentioned the low budget of his film: \"I wish you'd had more.\""}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Mistress America", "Review": "Noah Baumbach has been making movies for twenty years now, and they've nearly always been comedies of the sort that I call \"radio with pictures\"\u2014not because of any inherent lack of filmmaking skill (he's quite a good director) but because his characters are often so deluded or bitter or ignorant or self-aggrandizing or otherwise unpleasant that I find myself watching certain scenes through the cracks between my fingers. \"Kicking and Screaming,\" \"Mr. Jealousy,\" \"The Squid and the Whale,\" \"Margot at the Wedding\" and \"Greenberg\" were all picture-radio incarnate: astute at detailing the sorts of people you try to avoid at parties (or who try to avoid you, maybe?) and at times unnervingly willing to stick the knife into characters, and you, and twist it.  Advertisement Baumbach's collaborations since hooking up with onetime costar and now collaborator Greta Gerwig\u2014whom he first worked with on \"Greenberg\"\u2014have changed his tone. His movies are now slightly less scathing and a bit more accessible, but without for one moment sending the message that he's suddenly become nice and sweet. They feel even more like mid-period Woody Allen films than they already did, although Baumbach, like a lot of dialogue-driven American filmmakers, owes so much to Allen that this might have been inevitable no matter who he worked with. His latest, \"Mistress America,\" gives Gerwig the sort of role that Diane Keaton would have knocked out of the park for Allen: Brooke, an almost-thirtysomething New Yorker who talks and talks without every actually seeming to listen, much less connect, with anyone else, and who wants to be influential and famous and successful but doesn't seem to have any sort of realistic plan for achieving that, or any particular talents to bring to bear on her goal. Brooke isn't the main character of the film, though: that would be Tracy Fishcoe (Lola Kirke), a Columbia University student whose mother, Stevie (Kathryn Erbe), is about to marry Brooke's widowed dad. Tracy is an incoming freshman who doesn't know anyone in New York; she's never met Brooke, but her mom hopes Brooke will bond with her and become a companion or even mentor to her, and urges her daughter to make it happen.  Baumbach can be a marvelous, unsparing reporter on a certain slice of upper-middle-class to wealthy America. He brings that skill to bear here in the scenes of Tracy feeling out of her element. The satirical details of college student delusions of grandeur are expertly observed by Baumbach and his co-writer Gerwig, particularly the competition to get into a literary society that taps its new members by hitting them in the face with pies, then hands them briefcases to carry as emblems of their specialness. Brooke, her too-competitive classmate Tony (Matthew Shear), and Tony\u2019s dour girlfriend Nicolette (Jasmine Cephas Jones) are all sharply observed. Like many Baumbach characters, they're entitled and oblivious. They fantasize about skipping to the head of the cultural line, maybe collecting that Nobel for literature before they hit the big three-o. At the same time, the movie has trace elements of sympathy for the lonely and alienated: the scene where Tracy eats alone in a booth at a restaurant from a takeout container while listening to Paul McCartney's \"No More Lonely Nights\" on the PA system and pondering her cracked cell phone screen captures minor-key depression perfectly. Once Brooke whirls into the story, things take a turn for the madcap. She comes on like a classic Diane Keaton beautiful kook\u2014imagine Annie Hall by way of the character in \"Love and Death\" who insists that subjectivity is objective\u2014but there's a specificity to her that's uniquely maddening. She and Tracy match up in the a way that they probably both think is marvelous but that soon shows its downside. They aren't really talking to each other, but having adjacent monologues, with each waiting for a turn to chime in and talk about themselves. Gerwig and Baumbach's dialogue here nails this social class' self-aggrandizement with surgical precision. Brooke describes herself as an \"autodidact\" and adds, \"that word is one of the words I self-taught myself!\" She works casual mentions of her dead mother into unrelated conversations (\"That's cool about the frozen yogurt machine...everyone I love dies\"). She knocks her skull with her knuckles for good luck and brags about her newfound appreciation for \"the social media,\" which she hopes to parlay into making her dreams, whatever they are, come true.  Advertisement Brooke is the kind of person that you think of as a \"young spirit\" if you yourself are young and don't know any better. She calls herself a \"curator,\" a word that people use to describe themselves when they have no talent or skill. She talks about turning a cramped and awkward space into a combination restaurant, coffee shop and cultural crossroads called \"Mom's\" (of course). She's going to fund this venture by tracking down an ex-boyfriend named Dylan (Michael Chernus of \"Orange is the New Black\") and the wife, Mimi Clare (Heather Lind), that Brooke claims stole Dylan away from her, along with an idea that later proved lucrative. Brooke says this whole gambit is about redressing grievance, but if you've watched her for more than five minutes you know she's unreliable, and that unflattering details will come out soon enough. Baumbach has said that he had movies like \"Something Wild\" in mind while writing the script with Gerwig, and the film does have a touch of that formula, with Brooke as a variation of the \"life force\" character leading a more straitlaced narrator, Tracy, plus the increasingly unhappy Tony and Nicolette, on a whirlwind misadventure. There's a parallel story about Tracy developing the ruthlessness necessary to translate life into meaningful art. Of all the Columbia kids we meet, only she seems to have the stuff to become a credible writer of realistic fiction. Some of the snippets we hear in voice-over of \"Mistress America,\" a short-story-in-progress about Brooke, do suggest talent, plus an acuity that would make Brooke uncomfortable were she to read the finished piece. \"Her beauty was that rare kind that made you want to look more like yourself and not like her,\" says one of the more flattering lines, but at another moment she accurately describes the Brooke character as an exhausting, tragically limited person who uses others and bounces from one misconceived venture to another and seems incapable of looking inward. Other people, Tracy writes, avoided her because \"they could feel her failure coming.\" \"Mistress America\" is a very funny and observant movie, albeit squirm-inducing, with quotable dialogue. \"X doesn't roll like that,\" Brooke tells a student that she's tutoring in math, \"because X can't be pinned down.\" The movie starts to crater as soon as Brooke and Tracy and company end up at the modernist house where Dylan and Mimi Clare live, and find Mimi Clare overseeing a reading group for pregnant women; there are some good bits involving a pot stash and a Chipwich and literary affectations, but the length of the sequence, coupled with its essentially static nature, makes the film feel too much like a low-budget talk-fest in which everyone resolves their issues through monologues and revelations. Up until that point, though, it's a breezy and occasionally bracing movie, fun to watch if you're a bit of a masochist, or if you've ever suffered through a weekend or even an hour with people like these, and wondered why you can't hate them, and realized that it's because you probably see a little bit of yourself in them and it scares you.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Dan in Real Life", "Review": "Steve Carell of \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" has a personality, or maybe it is a lack of personality, that is growing on me. He is content to exist on the screen without sending wild semaphores of his intentions, his uniqueness and how funny he is. He's an everyman like a very (very) low-key Jack Lemmon. That makes him right for a romantic comedy like \"Dan in Real Life,\" during which he isn't expected to go over the top, but be just romantic and funny enough, you see, to let the situation work on its own terms. Advertisement He plays Dan Burns, a newspaper advice columnist, whose wife died four years before. He's raising three girls on his own, two teenagers and a pre-teen, and he must be doing a good job because they treat him like a slightly slow brother. At Thanksgiving, he takes them all to Rhode Island, where his parents (John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest) own a vast, rambling brown-shingled beach house you probably couldn't touch for $20 million. Since Mahoney's big job is wearing an apron in the kitchen, it's hard to see him as a guy owning that kind of real estate. Maybe he inherited. Also on hand is Dan's brother Mitch (Dane Cook). Dan goes into town in the afternoon and runs into Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore. They begin one of those conversations that threatens to continue for a lifetime. It's not love at first sight, but it's intrigue, approval and yearning. She supplies her phone number. That evening, brother Mitch brings his girlfriend home and, yes, it's Marie. That's the setup, and the movie deals with how to fit all those conflicting emotions into the house. Good thing it's big enough for lots of secret conversations on the move; the fact that social rules forbid them to declare their growing love make Marie and Dan feel all the more like blurting it out. Binoche is superb at looking upon her new man with the regret she'd feel for a puppy she can't adopt. The movie's director and co-writer, Peter Hedges, made the overlooked little treasure \"Pieces Of April,\" a 2003 Sundance hit, also about a Thanksgiving family reunion (which, oddly enough, also involved a family named Burns). His plot this time is less fraught, maybe because enormous stakes are not involved; Mitch and Marie are not desperately in love; Dan and Marie hardly know each other, and social awkwardness is the most difficult hurdle between here and happiness. That's why the movie's so soothingly pleasant. Advertisement Yes, there are some loud moments and big laughs, some of them involving the three girls, who seem to be enduring simultaneous hormonal yearnings, but Mahoney and Wiest keep a steady hand on the tiller, and the fireplaces and Arts & Crafts furniture exert a calming influence. Juliette Binoche also has much to do with the film's charm. French but eloquent in English, she fills a place that Ingrid Bergman used to inhabit in the cinema: Able to be very serious, very sweet, very beautiful, she has the gravitas to make this story seem more important than a mere game of switching partners. If the film has a flaw, and I'm afraid it does, it's the Sondre Lerche songs on the soundtrack. They are too foregrounded and literal, either commenting on the action or expounding on associated topics. In such a laid-back movie, they're in our face. The songs are on the movie's Web site, if you doubt me. But I got over the music and had a good enough time, although something tells me this is the kind of movie that will inspire countless queries from moviegoers asking me where that house is. I'll save you the trouble: I tried to find out, but couldn't. It looks real enough and not digital, but there's not a single exterior photo of it on the movie's official Web site."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Tramps", "Review": "\u201cTramps\u201d director Adam Leon once said something in an interview that I will never forget. While talking about his gritty debut film \u201cGimme the Loot,\u201d about two young graffiti writers wanting to tag a New York City landmark, Leon said that his goal was making someone\u2019s favorite movie of the year. That\u2019s quite a novel idea that only interesting filmmakers could accomplish\u2014to make something that speaks to a viewer so directly, it essentially fulfills what they need, what they've been yearning to see. And it proves a fitting statement coming from Leon, given that he\u2019s made a direct companion piece to \u201cGimme the Loot\u201d with \u201cTramps,\u201d which has a similar urban verve, style and even more sweetness. But while \u201cTramps\u201d may be inspired and unusual, it\u2019s hard to shake off the idea that Leon isn't just making the film he wants to see, he's riffing on himself. \u00a0 Advertisement   Like \u201cGimme the Loot,\u201d \u201cTramps\u201d concerns two young people in New York City, getting into an odyssey well over their heads and placing themselves into some mischief. This time it\u2019s Callum Turner\u2019s Danny and Grace Van Patten\u2019s Elle, as their meet-cute is a simple, profitable and possible crime. Pick up a suitcase, make an exchange, get paid later. Danny is doing it to help out his recently incarcerated brother, and we soon find out that Elle is doing it to start her unsatisfactory life anew. As strangers to one another, neither know what is in the suitcase. Still, the stakes of a payday causes enough nervous energy for the both of them, especially when Danny leaves the bag at the wrong spot, and the wrong person takes it.\u00a0   Despite that mystery, this movie is more about mischief than danger. It gets a lot of mileage out of what could be in that suitcase, but since comedian Mike Birbiglia is cast in the movie to more or less play his persona, whilst wearing baggy khaki shorts, you get pretty comfortable that the bag probably doesn\u2019t contain anything like Marcellus Wallace's soul or even a murder weapon. Like how \u201cGimme the Loot\u201d had one member of its graffiti-tagging duo walk around the city in socks, \u201cTramps\u201d prefers innocence. Credit goes to the nifty script by Leon (who co-wrote the story with Jamund Washington), which keeps the story active with jolts of stressful bad luck or completely surprising good luck, all while adhering to the logic the story has set for itself. Throughout their journey, as they search for the rural woman who might have their bag while realizing they might maybe kind of like each other, neither Danny or Elle have anything intriguing to say, but they are fun as a pair. And it\u2019s warming to see them enter into the boonies as a type of new reality, where they role-play relationship life by breaking into a fancy home and bike away wearing the owners\u2019 clothes. Still, it\u2019s \u201cTramps\u201d\u2019 attitude to be short and sweet that proves definitive, vital.\u00a0   \u201cTramps\u201d has a \u201cLa La Land\u201d-level nostalgia for the filmmaking of numerous gritty NYC movies from the '70s, and achieves a similar effect, where it comes off as old-school with a level of charm wholly reliant on individual taste. When recreating New York\u2019s bustling and behemoth qualities, Leon uses slow zooms onto two actors who are hundreds of feet away, while their dialogue is captured as if we were eavesdropping on them. This is the kind of film that seems excited about unintentional extras in the background glaring into the camera, whereas productions of similar size but previous eras and lesser filmmaking technology took that fourth-wall breaking as a budgetary sacrifice. \u201cTramps\u201d specifically yearns for a scrappy and practical look but\u00a0edges on tacky vintage, especially as its narrative becomes one splash of water away from losing its grit or one wrong music cue from being too twee.\u00a0 Advertisement   Also like \u201cLa La Land,\u201d \u201cTramps\u201d is a time capsule narrative experiment, in service of a romance that is equally sweet and stubbornly old fashioned. For example, Danny and Elle have fluffy banter at a carnival, while a gorgeous big band-like tune plays in the background. Framed like a dream away from their urban realities, it works. And yet later on, Danny insists to Elle, \u201cI don\u2019t want the girls in my building,\u201d as if \u201cTramps\u201d was taking place in a century where people only met and fell in love with those in their neighborhood. All of this whimsy seems to be part of Leon\u2019s goal, especially as he wraps them tighter and tighter together using an admirably constructed tone, but it\u2019s just not that interesting of a goal. It is cute, though."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Spider-Man 3", "Review": "Doubling back to pick up some titles I missed in the year The great failing of \"Spider-Man 3\" is that it failed to distract me from what a sap Peter Parker is. It lingers so long over the dopey romance between Peter and the long-suffering Mary Jane that I found myself asking the question: Could a whole movie about the relationship between these two twentysomethings be made? And my answer was: No, because today's audiences would never accept a hero so clueless and a heroine so docile. And isn't it a little unusual to propose marriage after sharing only one kiss, and that one in the previous movie, and upside-down? Advertisement Faithful readers will recall that I found \"Spider-Man 2\" (2004) the best superhero movie since \"Superman\" (1978). But I made the mistake of declaring that was because \"the movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and shortchange the humans behind them.\" This time, I desperately wanted Peter Parker to be short-changed. If I argued earlier that Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent were boring human beings, I had no idea how Peter would begin to wear on my nerves. And what's with Mary Jane? Here's a beautiful, (somewhat) talented actress good enough to star in a Broadway musical, and she has to put up with being trapped in a taxi suspended 80 stories in the air by alien spider webs. The unique quality of the classic comic books was that their teenagers had ordinary adolescent angst and insecurity. But if you are still dangling in taxicabs at age 20, you're a slow learner. If there is a \"Spider-Man 4\" (and there will be), how about giving Peter and Mary Jane at least the emotional complexity of soap opera characters? If \"Juno\" (opening Dec. 14) met Peter Parker, she'd have him for breakfast. Superhero movies and Bond movies live and die by their villains. Spidey No. 2 had the superb Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), who is right up there with Goldfinger and the Joker in the Supervillain Hall of Infamy. He had a personality. In Spidey No. 3 we have too many villains, too little infamy. Take the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). As an escaped con and the murderer of Uncle Ben, he has marginal interest at best. As the Sandman, he is absurd. Recall Doc Ock climbing buildings with his fearsome mechanical tentacles and now look at this dust storm. He forms from heaps of sand into a creature that looks like a snowman left standing too late in the season. He can have holes blown into him with handguns, but then somehow regains the bodily integrity to hammer buildings. And how does he feel in there? Molina always let you know precisely how Doc Ock felt, with a vengeance. Advertisement Then there is the black microorganism from outer space, which is not a villain, but plays one in the movie. It arrives on Earth in a meteorite that lands, oh, maybe 20 yards from Peter and Mary Jane, but this impact somehow escapes notice by the fabled Spidey-sense. Then it produces little black beasties that look like squids crossed with licorice rope. They not only coat people with a way-cool black glossy second skin, but specialize in spray-painting Spidey and Spidey wannabes. No ups, no extras. We know that Spider-Man's powers do not reside in his red suit, which lies in a suitcase under his bed. So how do fake Spideys like Venom gain their powers when they are covered with the black substance? And how does a microorganism from outer space know how to replicate the intricate patternwork of the Spidey costume, right down to the chest decoration? And to what purpose from an evolutionary point of view? And what good luck that the microorganism gets Peter's rival photographer, Eddie Grace, to infect, so that he becomes Venom! And how does Eddie know who he has become? Another villain is Harry Osborn, a k a the New Green Goblin (James Franco), son of the interesting original (Willem Dafoe) but not a drip off the old gob. While the first GG had the usual supervillain motivations (malevolence, envy, twisted abilities) his son is merely very angry and under the misapprehension that Peter/Spidey murdered his old dad. And then Peter and Harry have a fist fight when they should be doing Spidey and Goblin stuff. Yes, there are some nice special effects in the movie. I liked the collapsing construction crane sequence. But the damsel in distress this time was not Mary Jane but Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), the sexy blond lab partner Peter has somehow neglected to mention to Mary Jane, causing her heartbreak because at a civic ceremony he kisses her with our kiss, i.e., the upside-down one. While Peter goes through a period of microorganism infection, he combs his hair forward, struts the streets, attracts admiring glances from every pretty girl on the street, and feels like hot stuff. Wait until he discovers sex. Advertisement \"Spider-Man 3\" is, in short, a mess. Too many villains, too many pale plot strands, too many romantic misunderstandings, too many conversations, too many street crowds looking high into the air and shouting \"oooh!\" this way, then swiveling and shouting \"aaah!\" that way. And saints deliver us from another dinner date like the one where Peter plans to propose to Mary Jane. You know a movie is in trouble when the climactic romantic scene of the entire series is stolen by the waiter (Bruce Campbell). And poor Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). An actress of Harris' ability, asked to deliver a one-note performance, and that single note is fretting. How could Sam Raimi, having gone so right with \"Spider-Man 2,\" have gone so wrong with \"Spider-Man 3\"? Did the $250 million budget paralyze him? Has the series grown too heavy on its feet? How many times can we see essentially the same romantic scenario repeated? How much dangling in the air can one girl do? And how does Spidey keep his identity a secret anyway, when there are more arrivals and departures through his apartment's window than on a busy day at LaGuardia?"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Cured", "Review": "For his debut feature film, writer/director David Freyne has come up with the best kind of premise, the sort of thing that\u2019s so irresistible in its simplicity that people who didn\u2019t think of it get annoyed that they didn\u2019t think of it. (That\u2019s the thing about such irresistibly simple ideas\u2014they\u2019re actually not easy to come up with.) While scads of prior horror movies have merely inundated viewers with horrific stories about our friends and loved ones turning into flesh-eating undead monsters, \u201cThe Cured\u201d imagines a world in which the thing that created such horrors is indeed a virus, and one for which a cure has been found. The world is ours, and the country is Ireland. Advertisement The movie begins with a bloody sneaker, and a young man breathing heavily, ever more heavily, as a bloodthirsty expression takes hold of his face. This is Senan, played terrifically by Sam Keeley. The quick visions of his former self come to him in flashbacks and nightmares. Now, after an injection and hospital stay, he\u2019s normal again. There\u2019s a circle of blood in the lower white of his eye that\u2019s a mark of his former state. He and other cured are released into the general populace under the supervision of a none-too-pleased military man. Protestors distrust them. The cured, at least the most conscientious of them, don\u2019t trust themselves. Because they can remember what they did. And what Senan did what especially terrible.    Still, Senan has a home: that of his sister-in-law Abbie (Ellen Page), an American journalist and the widow of Senan\u2019s brother. Abbie and her little boy welcome Senan, but most of the cured are not so fortunate. There\u2019s Conor, for instance, who seems frail and gentle upon release; he has a bond with Senan that articulates itself in great physical closeness. Conor was once a prominent lawyer, now he\u2019s something like a sanitation worker, rejected by family. As Conor tries to draw Senan into an insurrectionist group, and also ingratiate himself into Abbie\u2019s life, he becomes more and more forceful. The performance here by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor is particularly vivid.    Meanwhile, in a medical facility cum prison, a group of what are called \u201cthe resistant,\u201d virus victims for whom the cure doesn\u2019t take, are about to be wiped out by the government. The developer of the cure races against time to synthesize a new version of the medicine, in part to save her own lover from death. Senan is enlisted as a medical assistant there. He\u2019s useful because the currently infected never attack one of their own, and they still recognize the cured as that. This glitch leads to all sorts of interesting plot complications and loopholes. Freyne\u2019s scheme also makes potent use of ideas developed in George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cDead\u201d series, particularly those about undead intelligence evolution put forward in \u201cDay of the Dead.\u201d    Advertisement The result is a very creepy, suspenseful story that\u2019s also a better-than-average character study. And as you may have inferred upon my saying the film was set in Ireland, the premise has a great deal of potential for allegory and metaphor. Freyne\u2019s hand here is assured; his world-creation (the cities are postered with PDAs about handling the crisis of what\u2019s called \u201cThe Maze Virus\u201d) doesn\u2019t lay things on too thick, but the points concerning trust, distrust and the weight of history and personal conscience are all hit with a satisfying directness. Eventually, the tension between the characters and their individual situations has to break, and this is the point at which the movie becomes its most conventional, with riots and chases and near-misses in the bit-by-one-of-the-infected department. For its familiarity, it\u2019s still engaging, and the final shots have a nice sting in the tail. Freyne is a filmmaker to watch, to be sure, and \u201cThe Cured\u201d is going to be a genre film to beat in 2018."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Brothers Bloom", "Review": "Those con-man movies are best that con the audience. We should think at some point that everything is for real, or even better, that we can see through it when we can't. I offer as examples works by the master of the genre, David Mamet: \"House of Games,\" \"The Spanish Prisoner\" and \"Redbelt.\" Rian Johnson's \"The Brothers Bloom\" lets us in on the con and then fools us. It does that in an interesting way. It gives us Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) and Bloom (Adrien Brody), and I might as well get this out of the way: I don't know why they're called the brothers Bloom when that's the first name of one, and neither seems to have a family name. Maybe I missed something. Advertisement From childhood, Stephen has fabricated con scenarios and created the characters and scripts for his younger brother Bloom to join him in. When they're adults, Stephen's girlfriend Bang Bang (Rinko Kikuchi), who speaks extremely rarely, is mostly involved as a passive bystander, witness, validator or sometimes more. For Stephen, life is a con, and he's living it. For Bloom, the game is getting old. They meet a promising mark named Penelope (Rachel Weisz), who is rich, beautiful and lonely, even though most women who are rich and beautiful don't have a crushing problem with loneliness. She falls into a scheme fashioned by the brothers, and I will not specify which falls in love with her, but one does, and then ... I have to watch my step here. The brothers are such perfectionists that they like to involve as many marks as they can. Let's leave it that. At a certain point, we think we're in on the moves of the con, and then we think we're not, and then we're not sure, and then we're wrong, and then we're right, and then we're wrong again, and we're entertained up to another certain point, and then we vote with Bloom: The game gets old. Or is it Stephen who finds that out? Bloom complains, \"I'm tired of living a scripted life.\" We're tired on his behalf. And on our own. The problem with the movie is that the cons have too many encores and curtain calls. We tire of being (rhymes with perked) off. When an exercise seems to continue for its own sake, it should sense it has lost its audience, take a bow and sit down. And even then \"The Brothers Bloom\" has another twist that might actually be moving, if we weren't by this time so paranoid. As George Burns once said, \"Sincerity is everything. If you can fake that, you've got it made.\" A splendid statement, and I know it applies to this movie, but I'm not quite sure how. This a period picture, but a little hazy as to which period. It's the second feature by the 35-year-old Rian Johnson, who made the acclaimed Sundance \"originality\" winner \"Brick\" in 2005. That was a film-noir crime story transplanted to a California high school. Now we have \"The Sting\" visiting Eastern Europe. \"The Brothers Bloom\" was filmed for a reported $20 million, which is chicken feed if you consider the locations in Montenegro, Serbia, Romania and the Czech Republic. The acting is a delight. Rachel Weisz creates a New Jersey heiress who is painfully lonely -- strange, for such a beauty -- and delightfully ditzy. Ruffalo is sincere at all times, even when he's not. Brody is so smooth his logical contradictions slide right past: He makes them sound as if they must mean something. And the enigmatic Bang Bang, who never says a word, but often seems as if she's about to. And Johnson wisely hired Mamet vet Ricky Jay, to provide a narration that suggests a lot more than he's telling. Advertisement Johnson has a fertile imagination, a way with sly comedy and a yearning for the fantastical. But he needs to tend to his nuts and bolts and meat and potatoes. The film is just too smug and pleased with itself; as a general rule, an exercise in style needs to persuade us it cares about more than style. Lesson in point: \"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.\" This movie is lively at times, it's lovely to look at, and the actors are persuasive in very difficult material. But around and around it goes, and where it stops, nobody by that point much cares."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Cabin in the Woods", "Review": "You're not going to see this one coming. You might think you do, because the TV ads and shots at the top reveal what looks like the big surprise \u2014 and it certainly comes as a surprise to the characters. But let's just say there's a lot more to it than that. \"The Cabin in the Woods\" sets off with an ancient and familiar story plan. Five college students pile into a van and drive deep into the woods for a weekend in a borrowed cabin. Their last stop is of course a decrepit gas station populated by a demented creep who giggles at the fate in store for them. (In these days when movies are sliced and diced for YouTube mash-ups, I'd love to see a montage of demented redneck gas station owners drooling and chortling over the latest carloads of victims heading into the woods.)  Advertisement It will seem that I'm revealing a secret by mentioning that this is no ordinary cabin in the woods, but actually a set for a diabolical scientific experiment. Beneath the cabin is a basement, and beneath that is a vast modern laboratory headed by technology geeks (Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) who turn dials, adjust levers and monitor every second on a bank of TV monitors. Their scheme is to offer the five guinea pigs a series of choices, which will reveal \u2014 something, I'm not sure precisely what. There is some possibility that this expensive experiment is involved with national security, and we get scenes showing similar victims in scenarios around the world. Now in your standard horror film, that would be enough: OMG! The cabin is being controlled by a secret underground laboratory! Believe me, that's only the beginning. The film has been produced and co-written by Joss Whedon (creator of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Angel\" and other iconic TV shows) and directed by his longtime collaborator Drew Goddard (writer of \"Cloverfield\"). Whedon has described it as a \"loving hate letter\" to horror movies, and you could interpret it as an experiment on the genre itself: It features five standard-issue characters in your basic cabin in the woods, and we can read the lab scientists as directors and writers who are plugging in various story devices to see what the characters will do. In some sense, the Jenkins and Whitford characters represent Whedon and Goddard. Ah, but they don't let us off that easily. That's what I mean when I say you won't see the end coming. This is not a perfect movie; it's so ragged, it's practically constructed of loose ends. But it's exciting because it ventures so far off the map. One imagines the filmmakers chortling with glee as they devise first one bizarre development and then another in a free-for-all for their imaginations. They establish rules only to violate them. That begins with the characters. They're stock archetypes. We get an action hero (Curt, played by Chris Hemsworth); a good girl (Dana, played by Kristen Connolly); a bad girl (Jules, played by Anna Hutchison); the comic relief (Marty the pothead, played by Fran Kranz), and the mature and thoughtful kid (Holden, played by Jesse Williams). What the scientists apparently intend to do is see how each archetype plays out after the group is offered various choices. There are even side bets in the lab about who will do what \u2014 as if they're predicting which lever the lab rats will push. Advertisement This is essentially an attempt to codify free will. Do horror characters make choices because of the requirements of the genre, or because of their own decisions? And since they're entirely the instruments of their creators, to what degree can the filmmakers exercise free will? This is fairly bold stuff, and it grows wilder as the film moves along. The opening scenes do a good job of building conventional suspense; the middle scenes allow deeper alarm to creep in, and by the end, we realize we're playthings of sinister forces.  Horror fans are a particular breed. They analyze films with such detail and expertise that I am reminded of the Canadian literary critic Northrup Frye, who approached literature with similar archetypal analysis. \"The Cabin in the Woods\" has been constructed almost as a puzzle for horror fans to solve. Which conventions are being toyed with? Which authors and films are being referred to? Is the film itself an act of criticism? With most genre films, we ask, \"Does it work?\" In other words, does this horror film scare us? \"The Cabin in the Woods\" does have some genuine scares, but they're not really the point. This is like a final exam for fanboys."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Roman J. Israel, Esq.", "Review": "\u201cRoman J. Israel, Esq.\u201d looks like prime Oscar bait. It has the glow of nobility and importance emanating from every frame courtesy of Robert Elswit\u2019s cinematography. The screenplay by writer-director Dan Gilroy is filled with dialogue about civil rights, the prison industrial complex and the common man. And its lead actor\u2019s famous good looks have gone AWOL so he may enroll in the Academy voter\u2019s favorite class, Frumpy 101. But don\u2019t be fooled! This is not Oscar bait at all. \u201cRoman J. Israel, Esq.\u201d is the kind of horrendous hot mess an actor makes directly after he wins the Oscar. Granted, Denzel Washington didn\u2019t win the golden statuette he deserved last year, but if he had, it might have justified why he chose this lifeless story as his follow-up. My best guess is that Denzel wanted to cosplay as Eddie Murphy\u2019s Norbit. He would have made a far better Randy Watson from \u201cComing to America,\u201d if you ask me. Advertisement But I digress. The version of \u201cRoman J. Israel, Esq.\u201d hitting theaters this week is not the same one that drew critical scorn at the Toronto Film Festival. The new cut is 13 minutes shorter and certain plot points have been edited in a different order. There\u2019s some vague notion that a \u201cmajor reveal/spoiler\u201d has been moved to an earlier spot in the film. Gilroy\u2019s story makes so little narrative sense that I have no idea what they\u2019re talking about, so I am issuing a spoiler warning from here on as a precautionary measure. Roman is a lawyer in a two-man criminal defense law firm in Los Angeles. He and his boss, William Jackson, handle cases for the downtrodden and underprivileged. William is the public face of the firm, arguing in court and meeting with clients. Roman does all the research and advises on how to approach each case. It\u2019s hinted that Roman has some form of Asperger\u2019s, though his Rain Man-like recollection of the number of every single statute leans him more heavily into savant territory. It is also hinted that Roman\u2019s lack of social cue recognition may have been the reason William never sent him to court. Of course, as \u201cRoman J. Israel, Esq.\u201d opens, William has suffered a soon-to-be-fatal heart attack and Roman has to cover for him in court. Before we see Roman in action, however, we\u2019re treated to voiceover by Washington that is meant to set up a flashback structure. The narration accompanies a legal brief Roman is writing. The brief is two paragraphs of legalese interspersed with nonsense, and we get to see it typed in its entirety on the screen. As letters fill the screen, the score gets louder and more bombastic in a vain attempt to telegraph suspense. In the brief, Roman calls himself a hypocrite who has sold out his own belief system. He casts himself as plaintiff and defendant in this damning confession. Advertisement Eventually, we\u2019ll return to this brief, but for now, we\u2019re thrown three weeks into the past where Roman makes his first court appearance in decades. Despite being told by William\u2019s assistant to simply ask for continuances, Roman engages the case. His client is getting a raw deal, to be sure, but Roman exacerbates the situation by arguing with the judge until he is held in contempt. Later, Roman will again go against his firm\u2019s wishes by telling off the district attorney in regards to a plea offer. Both of these scenes are played for laughs in the film\u2019s trailer, but neither scene is so damn funny in context: that contempt charge gets William\u2019s near-bankrupt firm slapped with a $5,000 fine; the district attorney flap indirectly results in a client\u2019s murder. It\u2019s clear that Washington and Gilroy want to cast Roman as some kind of grumpy genius\u2014he\u2019s the Dr. House of lawyers. The problem is that, unlike Dr. House, Roman is horrible at his job. You would not want this man representing you, nor would you want him, as Maya (Carmen Ejogo) discovers, to come speak at your activism meeting. Since William\u2019s firm was known for its community service, Maya hopes Roman can inspire her group. But Roman\u2019s ideas about women are as outdated as his clothing. This too is played for laughs in the trailer; in the film, the scene ends with an angry activist leveling the F-word at a confused Roman, turning this important meeting into chaos. The film's romantic interest Maya has the thankless job of echoing how great and inspiring Roman is supposed to be. She\u2019s necessary because we never see a single thing to support why we\u2019d care about Roman or his story. On a dinner date, Maya is so overwhelmed with admiration for Roman that she bursts into tears, and while Ejogo convincingly weeps, I couldn\u2019t help but ask myself \u201cwhy?\u201d You\u2019ll be asking yourself \u201cwhy\u201d a lot too, as this lifeless, interminable movie plays as if the filmmakers threw the footage up in the air and edited it in the order it hit the floor. Advertisement Why, for example, does Roman do what I think is that aforementioned \u201cmajor reveal/spoiler\u201d? I\u2019ll tread lightly here. Roman suddenly decides to accept money from a shady source, a breach of ethics that comes out of nowhere and is characteristically abnormal. Roman uses that money to bring his wardrobe up to the 21st century, to move into a swanky apartment and to tighten up his coif. He does not need the money, as he\u2019s been hired by the offices of rich lawyer George Pierce (Colin Farrell), the man whom the now-deceased William had selected to dissolve Roman\u2019s firm. Roman\u2019s actions may or may not be the hypocrisy he referred to in his damning brief, yet one wonders why he couldn\u2019t have just used his salary for his adventure rather than dirty money. His actions are inexplicable and serve only to give the film the tragic ending it neither earns nor deserves. \u201cRoman J. Israel, Esq.\u201d is rather insulting to folks like me who are on the spectrum. Washington gives one of his rare bad performances here, turning Roman into an improv sketch filled with tics, mannerisms and an overreliance on his attire. He\u2019s never a real person, even when he\u2019s having a paranoid episode or, in a fit of terror, trying to outrun a sports car in a U-Haul truck. The most memorable thing about him is his Eddie Kendricks ringtone, which plays \u201cKeep on Truckin\u2019\u201d whenever his flip phone lights up. The film is also insulting in how it treats Roman\u2019s pet activism project. Throughout the film, Roman obsesses over the contents of the case he always drags with him in an attach\u00e9. It\u2019s a controversial brief designed to change the way people of color are treated by the courts. We do not learn anything about this potentially fascinating court filing, nor do we spend enough time with the people who inspired Roman\u2019s obsession. Plus, the film\u2019s ending implies that Roman could only achieve his goal through a brutal sacrifice and a helpful White savior who\u2019s jarred into action only when the dead Black body is someone he cares about. As the Spinners\u2019 classic \u201cI\u2019ll Be Around\u201d played over the closing credits, all I could do was ask myself \u201cwhy?\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Nuclear Nation", "Review": "At one point in this new Japanese documentary about the Fukushima Daiichi power plant disaster, the camera focuses on a sign above a town turned to rubble. Loosely translated, the sign says, \"Atomic energy makes our town prosperous.\" One can't help but recall another sign, \"Arbeit Macht Frei,\" hovering above the site of another human tragedy. The mocking words in each case point up the horror beyond. But in the case of Fukushima the tragedy involves a conundrum of culpability, and the reaction to the immediate disaster has been strangely muffled. \"Nuclear Nation\" means to make some noise, but is only partially successful. If you were looking for a documentary to blow the lid off the secrecy around the extent of the destruction, and lack of restitution\u2014in other words outrage \u00e0 la Michael Moore\u2014you will not find it here, but there is much that is worthy and troubling. Advertisement What you will find is a young filmmaker, Atsushi Funahashi, who uses his camera as silent witness to what, up to now, has not been fully seen and acknowledged. Here's what we already knew: On March 11, 2011, a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit Japan causing a hydrogen explosion at the number 1 reactor at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station; radiation was released. The town of Futaba, 3 kilometers from the explosion, was ordered to evacuate immediately and those who fled had no time to take anything\u2014not clothes, not food, not pets or livestock. Eventually, two more reactors would be crippled. The earthquake and tsunami left 20,000 dead or missing in northeastern Japan. The filmmakers started shooting within three weeks of the disaster to show us what we didn't know. The movie opens quietly\u2014with the sound of wind and a shot of reactors in the hazy distance, then a close-up on cherry blossoms catching the breeze on a spring day. We later learn that the wind blew radiation in the direction of those fleeing ground zero. We also learn that the Japanese government failed to report the level of radiation and those residents were contaminated. Fourteen hundred of Futaba's inhabitants fled to an abandoned high school 250 kilometers away, and a year later, 500 still live there on the floor, in classrooms, eating rice gruel, trying to pass the time, mourning their dead relatives and friends, and feeling betrayed by a government and a corporation (The Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO) that has not apologized to them individually or told them what will become of their town or if they might ever go home. Home is now a landscape leveled; people cloaked in masks and protective garb have been gradually allowed back briefly to gather belongings from splintered homes. But it's the sight of the rotted, mummified corpses of livestock, left behind to die a slow death from starvation, that sickened me most, and that tacitly carries the film's message: the inhabitants who worked the plants have been left behind in the dark, not knowing what's to become of them. The film is most effective when the camera stands steadily by these refugees, the lens in close on their faces, to capture long-held emotion making its way to the surface. We meet a man and his son still agonized over the loss of the mother, \"a sweet woman,\" who was swept away, still in her home, by the tsunami. The sight of the son holding back tears is painful, but even more disturbing is watching him come to the realization that but for the power plants, his mother would be alive. Advertisement And this is the undercurrent that is never fully explored, what at some level everyone connected with the film\u2014filmmaker and villagers alike\u2014are dealing with. The filmmaker himself is from Tokyo, and understands that these nuclear plants were deliberately built far from the places where the power was used, becoming the main industry in small villages where people were promised jobs and money\u2014in exchange for all the risk. This is eventually conveyed by the mayor of Futaba, Katsutaka Idogawa. His town enjoyed the short-term benefits of the nuclear power business for 40 years, but now he says that he sees it was the people in Tokyo who prospered while \"we were swimming in radiation.\" His face reveals a troubling awareness of his role\u2014perhaps unwittingly\u2014in that Faustian bargain. Unfortunately, \"Nuclear Nation\" is slow going, and given the uniqueness of the documentation and the importance of its message, it deserves to be more compelling than it is. The film doesn't always make clear how much time has passed or where exactly we are. Too often the video meanders or the action stops so a fact can be trotted out, clumsily, as words on a black background with all the sound dropped out. Had this material been more pointedly and dramatically organized, and had the filmmaker been more willing to examine the cruel ironies of the issues raised in a country shadowed by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \"Nuclear Nation\" would have landed more powerfully in a world that is becoming harder to see through the haze."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Three Monkeys", "Review": "Nuri Bilge Ceylan\u2019s \"Three Monkeys\" begins on a lonely country road at night in the rain. A middle-age driver grows sleepy at the wheel. His eyelids droop lower, and then suddenly, there is a body on the road behind him, and he is awake now, weeping with fear. That\u2019s more action than took place in the whole of \"Distant\" (2002), Ceylan\u2019s oddly seductive film about a cousin who moves in and won\u2019t leave. This film is as steamy as the other was dry, an elegant exercise with four characters trapped by class, guilt and greed. Advertisement There is about enough plot here to furnish a 30-minute TV crime show, if they still made them anymore. What makes the film fascinating is its four central characters. Each one is locked within, hidden from the others, driven by private needs that all come together after the death in the forest. Ceylan films them in painterly widescreen compositions that impose a spectacular landscape, one of lowering clouds, indifferent skies and lonely vistas. In this world, their best companions are their desires. The sleepy man at the wheel is a politician named Servet (Ercan Kesal). He\u2019s in the middle of an election campaign. In a panic, he wakes his driver, Eyup (Yavuz Bingol), in the middle of the night and asks him to take the rap. If Eyup says he was at the wheel, Servet promises he\u2019ll get a short prison sentence, his salary will continue, and there will be cash waiting for him on his release. He agrees. We met Hacer, Eyup\u2019s wife (Hatice Aslan), and son Ismail (Ahmet Rifat Sungar). They live in a spartan flat on a top floor of a strikingly narrow building with such a great view they can hardly be bothered to look indoors. She\u2019s an attractive woman of not quite a certain age, stuck for life on hold. He is a good-looking kid at an age when poor young men often find there is money to be made from crime. He comes home one night bloodied and beaten, and she decides she needs more money to help him on a career path. Eyup is opposed to any idea of asking the politician for an advance. His reluctance is that of an employee reluctant to offend a rich and powerful man \u2014 even if he holds Servet\u2019s reputation in his hands.  His wife is not swayed by such class insecurity, approaches Servet, and soon, to their mutual surprise, is having an affair with him. Sounds like the plot of a 1930s pulp crime story, especially when her son finds out. But Ceylan is intrigued by more than just the spinning out of the story. There is something more going on. His characters are crowded for room. There\u2019s no place to escape to in their lives. They\u2019re always running up against one another\u2019s motives, needs, problems. And when Eyup gets out of prison, everything grows that much more complicated, especially as we learn more about the shaky foundations of the politician\u2019s career. Nor must we assume that Servet\u2019s affair with the other man\u2019s wife happened only because of cash. He and his stature offer her a way out of her dead end. Advertisement These themes are always there under the surface, possibly not perceived by his characters. They come into play when the plot takes an ironic direction that places Eyup and his son in a position similar to the one the politician placed them in. That\u2019s the kind of moral scorekeeping that film noir specializes in. The film has extraordinary beauty. Indeed, the visuals by cinematographer Gokhan Tiryaki are so awesome that the characters almost seem belittled, which may be Ceylan\u2019s purpose. They scramble about looking for ways out that life has closed to them, while the overarching sky remains indifferent. Words cannot do justice, but check out the still photos at http://budurl.com/hkft that will blow your socks off. Click on \"ansehen\" to enlarge. The title? About the monkeys who could see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil, of course. Look how far that got them. The film won the best director award at Cannes in 2008."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Accountant", "Review": "\u201cHow can you make a financial intrigue thriller more exciting than average?\u201d You can almost hear screenwriter Bill Dubuque ask that question and then crack his knuckles during the opening minutes of \u201cThe Accountant.\u201d Said opening minutes, directed with customary nose-to-the-grindstone conviction by Gavin O\u2019Connor, feature a strange scene of an urban mob massacre, tinged in sepia and boasting a lot of faux-celluloid graininess, to imply \u201cperiod grit.\u201d Then there is another scene, set in 1989, at a home for neurologically impaired kids, run by a kindly doctor who explains to a cranky dad and a less cranky mom why their \u201cdifferent\u201d son might have a better chance at adjusting to life in the world if he spends a summer at the institute. Said kid, watched over by his brother, puts together a jigsaw puzzle not only scarily quick, but also in a VERY novel way.\u00a0 Advertisement The next scene takes us to the present day, where a strip mall accountant named Christian Wolff (the allusion is to the German philosopher and mathematician, not the contemporary avant-garde musician and composer, and you can only imagine how let down I am by that), an affectless fellow played by Ben Affleck (who, frankly, is trying a little too hard to be flat\u2014the strain shows), dazzles a couple of his clients with tax code wizardry anyone who\u2019s ever filed under \u201cself-employed\u201d will recognize as pretty basic. And then we are whisked to the Department of The Treasury, where avuncular bigwig Ray (J.K. Simmons) delivers some exposition on a mystery man\u2014the fellow played by Affleck, as we already know. \u201cHe\u2019s their accountant, an accountant, \u2018the\u2019 accountant,\u201d Simmons says, sounding like he\u2019s setting up an episode of \u201cThe Blacklist.\u201d The junior officer he\u2019s telling all this to, played by Cynthia Addai-Robinson, is intrigued. And soon she\u2019s annoyed, as Simmons dredges some stuff up from her past to effectively blackmail her into tracking \u201cthe accountant\u201d down for him.\u00a0 There\u2019s quite a bit of stuff going on here, and for a good while \u201cThe Accountant\u201d percolates on its multiplicity of plot threads even as it keeps adding to them. As it happens, the \u201caccountant\u201d that the Treasury agents are looking for is up to quite a bit more than providing tax relief for rural dwellers. He uncooks the books for a slew of deadly bad guys. Deadly bad guys who are, an observant viewer will note, subsequently busted by the Treasury Department. Despite his proximity to some of the most dangerous criminals in the known universe, this man of dozens of aliases stays alive. How? Part of the answer is provided by the recurring flashbacks, in which Wolff\u2019s father (Robert C. Treveiler) provides young Christian with his more militaristic cure, which later manifests itself in sharpshooting and martial arts skills. I admit that it is a novel idea to take a \u201cRain Man\u201d-type character and also make him into a Lethal Killing Machine, but it\u2019s also in kind of bad taste, something the movie tries to ameliorate by depicting autism with sympathy and some progressive accuracy. Despite the fact that he has oodles of cash and precious art at his disposal, the accountant\u2019s life is a welter of pain, much of it in the form of self-punishment. The viewer is left to wonder why he plays the dangerous games he does.\u00a0 At that point, the nice British-accented woman who seems to be the only person he can truly trust, and with whom he communicates only by phone, tells him that it\u2019s time for him to take on a \u201clegit\u201d big client, and plops him in the lap of a high-tech prosthetic firm headed by John Lithgow. Turns out that Dana, one of that firm\u2019s accountants, played by Anna Kendrick\u2014doing, as she did in \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d fine work in a Non-Romantic-Romantic-Interest role\u2014has discovered a discrepancy. Christian uncooks it, as they say \u2026 and then very nasty assassins are dispatched to kill both Christian and Dana.\u00a0 Advertisement Here the action heats up. Christian kills a guy who looks a bit like Vice mascot and rapper Action Bronson, in a scene that is far and away my favorite in the movie. A very effective hitman/financial-malfeasance-avenging-angel played by Jon Bernthal shows up. The plot, as they say, thickens. And then it goes south. It goes very far south, with two plot reveals that are among the most ludicrous that I\u2019ve experienced in quite some time. The worse of the two twists is made genuinely hilarious by the cutaways to Lithgow watching things unfold on his home security cam monitors and looking in disbelief\u2014echoing the likely expressions of the audience. In any event, it certainly DOES succeed in being more \u201cexciting,\u201d say, than 1981\u2019s \u201cRollover.\u201d But excitement isn\u2019t always positive."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Yes Men Are Revolting", "Review": "Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno are the leaders of the Yes Men,\r\na satirical leftist activist group that gets their message across by putting\r\nwords in their target\u2019s\r\nmouths. When corporations (and/or nations run by corporations) need their\r\nevildoing embarrassed, Bichlbaum & Bonanno, along with help from their\r\nteam, pretend to represent the satirized in front of the press. Armed with\r\ncheap suits and pseudonyms the Coen brothers would wish they had thought of\r\n(Erastus Hamm, Kinnithrung Sprat, Granwyth Hulatberi), guerilla goofballs Mike\r\n& Andy become fake reps at conferences, where they announce grandiose\r\ninitiatives that are too good, or ridiculous, to be true. The news reports it,\r\nand once the hoax is revealed, the Yes Men can soap box about the underlying\r\nfrustration within their prank, while the targets begin damage control. It\u2019s a little Michael Moore\r\npolitics dressed up with\r\nSacha Baron Cohen\u2019s showmanship. Aside from the various news segments they've\r\nstarred in, their shenanigans have now been collected in three documentary\r\nfilms, creating the rare franchise that improves with each installment.\u00a0 Advertisement \"The Yes Men Are Revolting\" (co-directed by Bichlbaum,\r\nBonanno, and Laura Nix) prevails by justifying the duo\u2019s charismatic relationship with a bromantic arc, offering a\r\nresonant understanding of these culture jamming junkies. Instead of being dorky\r\nGen-X heroes (as in 2003's \"The Yes Men\") or self-designated cartoon\r\ncharacters (\"The Yes Men Fix the World\" from 2009), they're now\r\ncontextualized with relationships and jobs, as men whose vitalizing friendship\r\nis in a love triangle with activism. In the beginning of \"The Yes Men Are Revolting,\" the\r\ntwo are buddy-buddy in their political pranking, focusing this time on global\r\nwarming. Bichlbaum announces on behalf of a later-mortified U.S. Chamber of\r\nCommerce that they are now going to work against climate change, while Bonanno\r\ntries to show his support by arriving in a giant inflatable ball (the\r\n\"SurvivaBall,\" for all your natural disaster needs). When Bonanno\r\ncan't get in, he ventures to the Capitol with other SurvivaBall folk, and hurls\r\nhimself down the landmark's steps. \r\n\r\n After a nonetheless successful stunt later at the COP15 Climate\r\nChange Summit in Copenhagen, Bichlbaum & Bonanno are defeated by the lack\r\nof change from the conference, the ominous corporations winning again in the\r\nstruggle within world government for proper resources. They separate, which\r\ninadvertently provides the Yes Men saga needed personal reflection time about\r\nwhere they've come from. During these segments, Bonanno focuses on his\r\nexpanding family, while sharing with us the activism planted in him from his\r\nparents. Meanwhile, Bichlbaum breaks up with his boyfriend, reflects upon his\r\nown childhood, and begins to work with other members of the Yes Men brigade for\r\na stunt against the Shell company. He pulls off a definitive Yes Men prank\u2014aesthetically\r\npersuasive at first and with a grotesque\r\nclimax\u2014but without Bichlbaum, it's not the same. Advertisement A documentary fittingly executive produced by Adam McKay\r\n(director of \"Step Brothers,\" \"Anchorman\"), its third act\r\noffers the friendly fuzziness of a Hollywood comedy, but without a narrative\r\nsimplicity. The film's passion is bigger than Bichlbaum & Bonanno\u2019s\r\nfriendship, as their activism needs rejuvenation too. Featuring nods to the\r\nspirit within Occupy Wall Street and the reform achieved recently by other\r\ncountries, \"The Yes Men Are Revolting\" poignantly wraps itself up as\r\nan ode to friendship and the teamwork required to create change. Issues with \"The Yes Men Are Revolting\" mostly arise\r\nfrom the potential that this documentary's wider scope invites. The Bichlbaum\r\n& Bonanno backstories are finally divulged, but now the overall Yes Men\r\ncommunity inspires a nagging curiosity, especially as operations prove to be\r\nfar bigger than these two. And when engaging this comedic documentary as\r\nentertainment, don't just come for the shenanigans, as they aren't the\r\nsweet-spot. Their hoaxes can run flat with simply dressed-up madness, making a\r\npoint that's more rewarding with footage of news channels believing it more\r\nthan any significant comedic experience. Bichlbaum & Bonanno are naturally\r\nfunny guys, which is great for character-building. But while they are activists\r\nbefore filmmakers, they are not established entertainers first. Maybe the\r\nsequel to this film will involve another test of their friendship when a comedy\r\nwriter is added to the mix? Formerly a producer on \"The Yes Men Fix the World,\"\r\nco-director Nix is a crucial promotion to their filmmaking team. As Bichlbaum\r\n& Bonanno become primarily subjects once again (after co-directing\r\n\"The Yes Men Fix the World\" themselves), some great scenes involve an\r\noutsider's look into their friendship, such as the intimate denouement in\r\nBichlbaum\u2019s apartment that officially reunites them emotionally as they\r\nsit in a NYC power outage\u2019s total darkness. It's a multi-layered slice of them that would\r\nfit in the same spot within a Duplass-directed indie, as matched with some real-life\r\ncomedy from earlier, in which the two friends cram into a polar bear costume,\r\nand operate it step by step. Who said that a political film can\u2019t be\r\nsweet, too? In its grandest triumph, \u201cThe Yes Men Are Revolting\u201d is an activist doc inspired\r\nby more than just its topical issues.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "What to Expect When You're Expecting", "Review": "Just what we needed. First \"Friends With Kids\" two months ago, about three couples who confront pregnancy, and now \"What to Expect When You're Expecting,\" about five couples so much in synch that deliveries and an adoption occur on the same day. I'd rather see a movie about one couple, treated in some depth, than these round-robins with the editor working up a sweat to keep all the stories in the air. \"What to Expect\" is a cheerful comedy with just enough dark moments to create the illusion it's really about something. It toplines Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Elizabeth Banks, Anna Kendrick and Brooklyn Decker as prospective mothers, and as three live births are intercut, Diaz wins the screaming contest as people shout \"push! push!\" at her. The girl's a trouper. Maybe we should be grateful that Lopez, in Ethiopia to meet her adoptive son, doesn't start screaming in sympathy. Advertisement But I'm being too snarky. This is a good-hearted movie with some winning performances, but it has so many characters (including a boys' club of new dads) that the plot nearly stalls with gridlock. It's clever but the stories are thin soup. There seems to be an informal law that characters in a movie like this must have unusual and colorful occupations, to provide easy markers as we move between stories. Diaz plays Jules, a TV weight-loss guru; we meet her and boyfriend Evan (Matthew Morrison) just as they win a celebrity dance show on TV. When they're presented with a loving cup, Jules throws up into it. Gosh, maybe she's pregnant? Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) is a best-selling advocate of breast-feeding, who despairs of ever getting a chance to practice it herself; she and husband Gary (Ben Falcone) have been tirelessly trying to conceive as slaves to an ovulation schedule that once sends them racing into the back room of a baby store for a quickie. Gary has spent years in the shadow of his father, Ramsey (Dennis Quaid), a millionaire NASCAR champion, whose trophy wife, Skyler (Brooklyn Decker), is about 40 years younger. When Gary and Wendy proudly announce \"we're pregnant!\" Ramsey wins again: He and Skyler are having twins. Jennifer Lopez plays a famous photographer, seen scuba-diving to shoot manta rays; after she and Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) cannot conceive, they adopt the little Ethiopian, who looks adorable enough to pose for Gerber's ads. We're not out of cool jobs yet. Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chace Crawford) own competing food trucks, which vend fast food at events. She gets pregnant via a one-night stand, complaining at the hospital, \"We never even went out on a real date.\" Counterpoint for these stories, as if one was needed, is a quartet of new dads who meet weekly to wheel baby carriages through the park. They're led by Vic (Chris Rock), who is rich in one-liners. On every stroll they meet their mutual friend Davis (Joe Mangianello), a narcissistic fitness buff who would rather work out than impregnate anyone. In one gratuitous scene, he does pull-ups on a bar perfectly positioned to show off his six-pack abs, and then does one-armed pull-ups while using the other hand to check his cell phone. No call is that important. Advertisement Three of the stories sync in delivery rooms of the same hospital. The other two have happy endings. What the five couples have in common is that they're all in the same movie. The only interlocking stories are the NASCAR hero and his son. No, wait \u2014 the son is connected to Diaz because he was on her weight-loss show.  The movie is essentially a clothesline on which to display trigger-pushing moments. I grew weary of circling endlessly among the various stories. The actors are all good company, and I would have enjoyed seeing more of each role, something I suspect they would agree with me about. The movie is inspired by the best-seller by Heidi Murkoff. It is non-fiction, which is just as well; there's no room here for anything more."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Footnote", "Review": "When I describe \"Footnote,\" you may conclude that it offers little for you. In fact, it's one of the smartest and most merciless comedies to come along in a while. It centers on an area of fairly narrow interest, but in its study of human nature, it is deep and takes no prisoners. Two main characters: The father has devoted his life to scratching out minute inconsistencies in various versions of the Talmud. His son is a great popularizer of Judaic lore, whose books are best-sellers and whose face is often on television. Advertisement Eliezer (Shlomo Bar Aba), the father, has labored for years without much recognition. He takes great pride in once having been mentioned in a footnote of a book by a legendary scholar. Uriel (Lior Ashkenazi), the son, is one of those facile popularizers to whom everything comes easily. The film opens in a teeth-grating ceremony where the son is receiving a prestigious prize, and his father is seated stony-faced in the audience. Uriel goes out of his way to praise the old man, but this serves only to reflect on the old man's obscurity, and Eliezer knows it. The film could be about a father-son rivalry in any field. I once had a professor who was a Great Man, the editor of a much-honored edition of Shakespeare. Among his other feats was the Variorum Edition of \"Romeo and Juliet.\" That involved the meticulous comparison of all the editions of Shakespeare's tragedy, noting every variance and allowing the reader to approach as closely as possible Shakespeare's original words. I remember sitting in a campus coffee shop buzzing with caffeine and underlining passages so that I too could determine the correct reading.  That may sound boring as hell to you, but I'd been to this man's book-jammed office in the English Building, and his quest seemed to me grand and romantic. Imagine how he would have felt to know that in a few decades, all his heavy lifting would be done by a computer. Ah, but it was his judgment that mattered, not his years of footnotes. In that sense, Uriel has moved directly to the end stage and made his father's labor seem like busywork. \"Footnote,\" a nominee for the foreign film Oscar this year, benefits from uncanny casting. Much of its success comes from the presence of the actors themselves. The story pendulum swings back and forth between father and son, who are both sympathetic and both tiresome and mean-spirited. We are expected to know nothing about the Talmud, except that they believe it justifies their lifework. As we meet their wives, we sense that what benefit it has done them hasn't been reflected in their marriages. Nor has it inspired a good father and good son. Advertisement All of this leads up to a masterful series of ethnical dilemmas in the film's last half. The Talmud provides guidance to Jews about how to lead their lives, but these two Jews have learned nothing that helps them when they find themselves in an impossible situation.  Please be aware that a plot point is about to be revealed. The greatest honor available to either man is the Israel Prize. Eliezer receives a call congratulating him on having won it. Vindication at last for a lifetime of labor! Then Uriel is told a stunning piece of information. The father was mistakenly called. The prize was actually voted to the son. This cannot be. For the old man to be announced as the winner and then have the prize snatched away is a species of humiliation almost unimaginable.  So much for the spoiler. The film's richest scenes are still to come, and I will not spoil them. They involve an emergency meeting of the Israel Prize committee, and the involvement of the old curmudgeon Grossman (Micah Lewesohn), who is the chairman. There is a deadly serious meeting of six or seven scholars in an office large enough for two, and the choreography is hilarious. An apparent solution is arrived at. Grossman, who has been a lifelong saboteur of Eliezer's work, has demands that must be met. Then, in a brilliant montage, we see Eliezer at work. The most crucial textual reading of his life takes place, ironically, in connection with this personal crisis. There's more comedy in the film, some of it involving Eliezer's ignorance of modern publicity and public relations, some of it indicating that in his ivory tower he doesn't know what security guards are. It's a rich irony that when Eliezer is interviewed by a reporter, he shoots himself in his own foot. What happens is a series of events involving academic scholarship, familial jealousy and pride, stubbornness and poetic justice. All of these things come together wonderfully, and are so subtle that only the father and the son will completely understand them. Perfect. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Theory of Everything", "Review": "Here is the sad and frustrating irony of \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d: it\u2019s a biopic about one of\r\nthe most brilliant people in the history of the planet, the renowned astrophysicist\r\nStephen Hawking \u2013 a man famous for thinking in boldly innovative ways \u2013 yet his\r\nstory is told in the safest and most conventional method imaginable. This is ironic given the director: James Marsh, an Academy Award winner for the 2008 documentary \u201cMan\r\non Wire,\u201d which was so thrilling and so clever in its narrative structure that\r\nit made you leave the theater feeling as if you\u2019d actually witnessed Philippe\r\nPetit walking across a tightrope between the World Trade Center Towers. (You\r\ndidn\u2019t \u2013 the film features photographs and reenactments but no film footage of\r\nPetit pulling off his daredevil stunt. That\u2019s how persuasive Marsh can be.) Advertisement Here, he\u2019s made a strongly acted,\r\nhandsomely crafted film that nonetheless feels bland and unsatisfying. It falls into the trap that so many biopics do: It\r\nhits all the key moments in the life of the author of \u201cA Brief History of Time\u201d\r\nand skims the surface of a complicated existence without digging deeper,\r\nwithout taking chances. Everyone involved does everything they should, and the\r\nresult is just sort of \u2026 fine. Of course, Hawking\u2019s story is\r\ninspiring \u2013 the way he\u2019s battled motor neuron disease over the past 50 years\r\nand defied the odds not only to survive, but thrive. And in playing Hawking,\r\nEddie Redmayne more than rises to the challenge of portraying the man's gradual physical deterioration but also conveying the spark of mental acuity\r\nthat has remained, and marked all of Hawking\u2019s important work. Nothing the\r\n32-year-old actor has done previously (\u201cLes Miserables,\u201d \u201cMy Week With\r\nMarilyn\u201d) suggested he had this sort of complexity in him. It\u2019s an impressive\r\nperformance, so much so that it makes you wish it were in the service of\r\nstronger material. \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d comes\r\nfrom screenwriter Anthony McCarten, based on \u201cTravelling to Infinity: My Life\r\nWith Stephen,\u201d the memoir by Hawking\u2019s first wife, Jane. A general feeling of\r\ntastefulness permeates the proceedings, as if everyone wanted to be overly\r\nrespectful toward these people, and their life, and the access they provided,\r\nat the expense of revelations that might have seemed inappropriate or startling or, heaven forbid, thought-provoking. The love and support we see from\r\nJane Hawking are tireless; as portrayed by a fresh-faced Felicity Jones, Jane\r\nis a woman of both grace and strength. And what she went through in taking care\r\nof him while raising their three children and trying to focus on her own\r\nintellectual pursuits must have been exhausting, and often\r\ndiscouraging. It must have threatened to swallow her whole. We see very little\r\nof that here. This Jane is a saint. But the early scenes between\r\nRedmayne and Jones positively crackle. There\u2019s an instant connection when they\r\nspy each other across a crowded room at a party at Cambridge in 1963. He\u2019s\r\nfumbling and funny, she\u2019s pretty and perky. He\u2019s studying cosmology, she\u2019s\r\nstudying medieval Spanish poetry. He\u2019s an atheist, she\u2019s a devout follower of\r\nthe Church of England. But they\u2019re mutually curious and seem to bring out the\r\nbest in one another. Their preliminary days include a romantic scene involving the little-known properties of Tide laundry detergent. Advertisement Everything seems possible for\r\nthese two young and brilliant minds, until Hawking experiences a series of\r\nincreasingly clumsy moments, followed by a serious spill on the campus\r\ncourtyard. Then comes the diagnosis at age 21 that he has motor neuron disease,\r\nor ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. The doctor also gives him just\r\ntwo years to live. Hawking tries to withdraw but Jane won\u2019t have it; she forces\r\nher way into his life and insists she\u2019s ready for whatever comes their way.\r\nThey quickly marry, and eventually have three children. But as Stephen\u2019s body weakens and\r\nthe family has to make continual adjustments to his physical status \u2013 including\r\nthe famous computerized voice he creates when he no longer can speak, which is\r\nthe source of some of the film\u2019s precious few laughs \u2013 his mind stays sharp. He\r\ncontinues his pursuit of the one simple, elegant equation that will explain\r\neverything in the universe. (And it should be noted that \u201cThe Theory of\r\nEverything\u201d is one of three films opening this week in which black holes figure\r\nprominently, alongside \u201cInterstellar\u201d and \u201cBig Hero 6.\u201d) Not unlike our own\r\ndear Roger Ebert, Hawking\u2019s mind became even more expansive and powerful once\r\nhe began losing his physical abilities. Eventually, \u201cThe Theory of\r\nEverything\u201d reaches a point where it toys with a challenging notion: the\r\npossibility that Jane and Hawking each had dalliances on the side with the\r\nother\u2019s tacit approval, once it became clear that their marriage had changed\r\nirreparably. Jane sought solace with Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox), the\r\nhunky, widowed choir director with big, brown puppy-dog eyes who served as\r\nHawking\u2019s caretaker, and the family\u2019s de facto husband and father figure. Hawking\r\nlater had the pleasure of spending time with the beautiful and vibrant\r\ntherapist Elaine (a charismatic Maxine Peake), who flirted with Stephen and\r\neven leafed through the pages of a Penthouse magazine for his perusal. But the film glosses over\r\nthese extra-marital relationships and their resolution with\r\nlittle muss, fuss, or emotional distress. It tiptoes toward the fire and then\r\nscurries back. It\u2019s unfortunately an apt metaphor for the film as a\r\nwhole.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Gimme Shelter", "Review": "\"Gimme Shelter\" starts with a lot of promise. We see shots of a gritty New York not often seen in films today: rattling above-ground subway lines, tenements, dank hallways filled with noise and chaos. Over the urban landscape shots, we hear a whispering female voice, \"I'm not scared. I can do this. I'm okay.\" Vanessa Hudgens, fully separated now from her \"High School Musical\" persona, having taken gritty almost feral roles in \"Sucker Punch,\" \"Spring Breakers,\" and \"Frozen Ground\", stands in a cramped bathroom, chopping off her black hair, whispering those words to herself. Her words will come up again as her character, Apple, makes a run for it, out of the life handed to her, into a life she created. Advertisement \"Gimme Shelter\" has an episodic structure that gives a monotonous \"and then this happened, and then this happened\" feel to all of the hardships that Apple encounters. There are car crashes and locked shelter doors, uncomprehending social workers and screaming families. Father McCarthy, a\u00a0kindly priest played by James Earl Jones, hovers around Apple, shining his benign light.\u00a0 Based on a true story, \"Gimme Shelter\" ultimately is about the work of Kathy DiFiore, who created Christian shelters for pregnant teens who want to keep their babies. The scenes of Apple in the shelter all the other pregnant girls are the film's best, but the shelter doesn't appear until halfway through, Krauss having decided for some reason to hold it back. What this does is it makes the shelter seem like a sub-plot, or another \"and then this happened\" episode, when it is actually the point of the whole thing.  Aside from James Earl Jones and a baffled and uptight Brendan Fraser, Vanessa Hudgens is the only \"name\" in the film. She is in every scene. She carries the action. Like the famous \"women's pictures\" in the 1940s, \"Gimme Shelter\" is interested in the up-and-down journey of its lead female character: her struggles and triumphs, failures and flaws. Every detail here is right. The piercings on Apple's nose and lips look infected, her skin is blotched and pimply, and when she gets a chance to eat, she shovels the food in her mouth like a wild animal. Apple has been \"in the system\" since her earliest days, she has been abused and raped and molested, and the \"system\" kept shoving her back into the pit. Her mother, played by an almost-unrecognizable Rosario Dawson, was \"born in the streets\", she has rotting yellow teeth, bruises on her legs. The \"system\" keeps trying to re-unite Apple with her mother, against Apple's clear wishes. But Apple is still a minor.  In the opening scenes of the film, Apple escapes from her mother's clutches and makes her way to New Jersey to track down the man who is her biological father (Brendan Fraser), a man she has never met. The man now lives in a Daddy Warbucks-level mansion with his wife (Stephanie Szostak) and two kids, and they try to adjust to the advent of Apple, who is rude and sullen, with atrocious table manners. When it becomes obvious that Apple is pregnant, Mrs. Daddy Warbucks takes her to a clinic to get an abortion. Apple stares at the ultrasound pictures, deciding whether she wants to keep the baby. She needs shelter, of course. Advertisement Kathy DiFiore is a character in the film. She's played by Ann Dowd, in a powerful and compassionate performance that doesn't look like acting. She seems like a real person. \u00a0She has a sense of mission towards the unborn babies under her care, as well as to the girls who live in her house. The girls in these scenes are wonderful, anonymous, they seem to have stepped right off the streets. Their interactions feel improvisational and fresh.While there is some bickering, none of it gets too harsh. For the most part it is a supportive family atmosphere.\u00a0 The couple of scenes between Dawson and Hudgens vibrate with pain and ugliness. The script is often obvious, with all feelings laid out too cleanly, but both actresses still manage to create a jagged relationship based on their characters' codependence and shared traumas. One of the film's strengths is its portrayal of the \"system\" and what it does to abused children, and the layers of bureaucracy that make it hard to bring about meaningful change in people's lives.  There's a reason the Christian media has been following this film closely. The religious aspect of \"Gimme Shelter\" is right out on the table, once the kindly priest shows up, but it's undercut by the grubby and warm reality of those girls in the shelter. There are some scenes where the girls grumble to one another at being made to collect donations in local churches, and be trotted out as success stories of living in the light of Jesus. The film never says the words \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\" It genuinely seems to be about how the system has broken down entirely, and how sometimes it is up to privately funded charities to provide a light at the end of the tunnel."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Father of My Children", "Review": "\"How much do I owe you?\u201d the producer asks someone on his cell phone. He chuckles. \u201cThat much?\u201d He is amused, busy, filled with energy. He handles two phones at a time while threading through Paris traffic and heading for a country weekend with his family. He smokes. He drives. He tells his wife, \u201cI'm almost on the highway.\u201d He's stopped by the cops, who ask if he knows why they stopped him. \u201cI have a vague idea,\u201d he says. In the opening sequence, we meet a plausible human being. A French film producer, an honest hustler, a loving father and husband, confident of his powers, enjoying his work. \u201cThe Father of My Children\u201d will watch this man come to pieces. It will not be dark melodrama or turgid psychology. It will simply be the story of a good man, well-loved, who runs into a dead end. Advertisement The man is named Gregoire (Louis-Do de Lencquesaing). The actor, like many French actors, is good-looking without being improbable. He runs his business in his head. He explains, \u201cI don't work with the kinds of directors who do television.\u201d He commits to a filmmaker and goes the limit for the film not because he has lofty ideas about Art, but because that's the kind of man he is. In the movie, he is plunging into debt while producing an obscure project of a temperamental auteur not a million miles distant from Lars von Trier. He gets phone reports from the set from his trusted assistant, hears of troublesome actors and bad weather, deals with money and debt, and meanwhile, loves his wife Sylvia (Chiara Caselli) and three daughters, Clemence (Alice de Lencquesaing), Valentine (Alice Gautier) and Billie (Manelle Driss). Their country house evokes quiet family togetherness, which is the idea, but Gregoire's mind is often elsewhere, trying to find a way out of his troubles. When very busy men are also essentially good men and working at something worthwhile, they tend to find themselves surrounded by supporters and enablers. Gregoire's office also serves as a family, in a way, and his employees share his vision. When calamity strikes, even his wife pitches in to help salvage his dream. The film's second half is the most touching, because it shows that our lives are not merely our own, but also belong to the events we set in motion. Louis-Do de Lencquesaing is effective here at not going into manic mode. He runs his business while improvising from moment to moment, he has some plans for getting through, he tries some scenarios, and he doesn't need anyone to tell him when they're not working. I appreciate the ability of the director, Mia Hansen-Love, to allow the situation to develop through observation of her hero, instead of using dialogue to explain everything.  Chiara Caselli, as Gregoire's wife, is, like many wives of workaholic men, better-informed of his business than he can imagine. She believes in him, therefore in his hopes, and touchingly relates with the members of his office family as they all try to move things along. And the film gives due attention to the children, particularly Clemence (played by de Lencquesaing's own daughter), who negotiate unfamiliar emotional territory with their mother. The title (in French, \u201cLe pere de mes enfants\u201d) is appropriate. Spoiler: The story is said to be inspired by the life of the real-life producer Humbert Balsan, who made Lars von Trier's \u201cManderlay\u201d (2005). Balsan had considerable success, making nearly 70 films, including three by James Ivory, and even acting for Robert Bresson. He committed suicide when his business imploded.  The film won the special jury prize in the Un Certain Regard section of Cannes 2009. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "If I Stay", "Review": "She\u2019s only 17, but already Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz has cemented\r\nher ability to play a wide variety of characters who are both girlish and wise\r\nbeyond their years, from the \u201cKick-Ass\u201d movies to \u201cLet Me In,\u201d and even last\r\nyear\u2019s\u00a0 \u201cCarrie\u201d remake. In \u201cIf I Stay,\u201d\r\nbased on the weepy young adult novel about a teenage girl trapped in an\r\nethereal realm who must choose between life and death, her grounded,\r\nnaturalistic presence goes a long way toward making mushy material palatable.  Moretz\u2019s performance\u2014and the easy chemistry she shares in\r\nflashbacks with co-star Jamie Blackley as her boyfriend\u2014help fortify a story\r\nthat, for all its popularity, is rather maudlin and painfully awkward at times.\r\n Advertisement Granted, a lot of this stuff works better on the page. Fans\r\nof Gayle Forman\u2019s best-selling novel will be happy to see that director R.J.\r\nCutler and screenwriter Shauna Cross have stayed true to its back-and-forth\r\nstructure, and the small tweaks in details here and there are improvements.\r\nCutler\u2014making his narrative feature debut following documentaries including\r\nthe \u201cThe September Issue,\u201d about Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour\u2014keeps\r\nthings moving in brisk, efficient fashion.  You get the sense in watching this that Cutler wanted to\r\nkeep the melodrama to a minimum, and indeed, \u201cIf I Stay\u201d does feature some\r\nmoments of powerful understatement. Still, there was major sobbing and\r\nsnuffling in the audience at the screening I attended. As in this year\u2019s other\r\ndying-girl drama based on a popular YA novel, \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d the\r\nexpectation and release are crucial to the catharsis. It\u2019s reliable and\r\nirresistible, and there is an audience for that sort of experience. And yet, the vision of Moretz\u2019s character, Mia, hovering\r\nover her own comatose body after a devastating car accident and running\r\nfrantically through hospital corridors searching for answers just feels jarring\r\nand forced compared to the comfortable energy that exists elsewhere. Imagining\r\na ghostly purgatory in your mind as you\u2019re reading is one thing; seeing it\r\ndepicted literally on screen is something else entirely, and it\u2019s clunky. \u201cIf I Stay\u201d begins in happier times. Mia, a cello prodigy\r\nwith dreams of attending Juilliard, is enjoying a snowy morning with her mother\r\nand father (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard), former rock \u2018n\u2019 rollers who\u2019ve\r\ntoned it down but maintained an irreverent sense of cool, and her younger\r\nbrother, Teddy (Jakob Davies). Mia will go on to say later in the movie that\r\nshe feels like a space alien in this family, with her quiet demeanor and love\r\nof classical music. But her honest exchanges with her parents\u2014particularly\r\nthe appealingly down-to-Earth Enos as her mother\u2014are among the film\u2019s\r\nstrongest moments. On their way to visit longtime friends and their new baby,\r\nthe family\u2019s car slams into an out-of-control vehicle on an icy Portland road. As emergency workers dash about treating the victims, Mia finds herself\r\nwandering among them in a hazy, out-of-body experience. She quickly hops into\r\nher own ambulance to the hospital and continues to follow herself from surgery\r\nto the intensive care unit. As her earthly self clings to life, her mind\r\nwanders to the past, bringing us up to speed on who she is and how she got\r\nhere.  Advertisement We see Mia and Blackley\u2019s Adam fall in love over their\r\nshared love of music, although as the lead singer and guitarist of a rock band\r\non the rise, his is a very different kind. The way in which they try to meet\r\neach other halfway and understand one another\u2019s tastes is sweet and playful.\r\nYou can see the dreamy allure he holds, with his puppy-dog eyes and a front man\u2019s\r\nedge. We see Mia passionately practicing her cello\u2014Bach\u2019s\r\n\u201cCello Suite No. 1 in G,\u201d naturally, as much of a standard as The Ramones\u2019 \u201cI\r\nWanna Be Sedated,\u201d which inspired Adam to pursue music at a tender age. We see\r\nher give the performance of her young life at her audition for Juilliard. And\r\nwe see her enjoying girl talk over coffee with her best friend, Kim (Liana\r\nLiberato, nicely underplaying the wisecracking sidekick role). Her life seems so rich and full and interesting\u2014and her\r\ndilemma over whether to move across the country to pursue her dreams or stay\r\nhome for the safety of true love is so compelling\u2014that the material that\r\nconstitutes the flashbacks could have been a fine coming-of-age drama in and of\r\nitself. But of course there is something of greater spiritual magnitude at play\r\nhere, complete with an extremely literal white light that beckons her to let go\r\nand follow it.  Should she stay or should she go? It\u2019s a musical question\r\nAdam is probably more familiar with, but Mia\u2019s answer is never in doubt."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Rebels of the Neon God", "Review": "Tsai Ming-Liang's debut film \"Rebels of the Neon God,\" a youth-in-revolt \r\nstory that's finally being released to US theaters 23 years after its \r\ndebut, is the director's most accessible film. That will seem like a \r\nfunny observation once you've seen it, because Tsai's most accessible \r\nfilm is more unusual and uncompromising than any you're likely to see \r\nthis year. The movie starts with the offscreen sound of a \r\ntropical storm battering a city, then observes two teenage \r\nsmartasses,\u00a0Ah Tze (Chen Chao-jung) and\u00a0Ah Bing (Jen Chang-bin), \r\ncrowding into a rain-smeared phone booth and robbing the coin box with \r\ncrude tools. Hardly a word passes between them. They're both smoking the\r\n whole time; the cigarettes rarely leave their lips. The next half-hour \r\nunfolds with a similar paucity of dialogue. You're just watching Ah Tze,\r\n Ah Bing and a handful of other major characters walking, riding \r\nscooters, talking, studying, stealing motherboards from video games, \r\narguing with parents, and acting and reacting within the context of \r\ntheir gigantic home city, Tapei\u2014which, despite the film's references to \r\nestablished deities, is obviously the \"neon god\" of the title. This\r\n is one of the great modern films about big cities and the mostly \r\nunacknowledged psychic toll of living in them.\u00a0Early on, a dutiful but \r\nfrustrated student,\u00a0Hsiao-kang (Lee Kang-sheng), impales a cockroach \r\nwith the sharp point of a compass and pins it to his desk to watch it \r\ndie slowly\u2014an expression of astonishing frustration and anger expressed \r\nin an offhand way. A couple of scenes later, he angrily tries to kill \r\nanother cockroach clinging to the outside of his bedroom window, \r\naccidentally shatters the glass, cuts himself, and has to staunch the \r\nblood, to the alarm of his parents\u00a0(Lu Yi-ching and Miao Tien). There \r\nare times when every character could be an inmate in a prison movie, \r\ndoing whatever he or she has to do to make the time go faster. There are\r\n many shots of people in cot-like beds, sometimes having sex or \r\npleasuring themselves but more often smoking or sleeping or staring at \r\nthe ceiling. Tsai lingers on details that express great longing, sadness\r\n and mystery, such as a when the camera tracks a series of objects \r\nfloating in floodwater on an apartment floor (including a crushed soda \r\ncan and a cigarette butt), or when we observe\u00a0Hsiao-kang exiting a \r\ncampus building amid a sea of parked scooters to discover that his has \r\nbeen towed, for some random reason. (In the background we hear a young \r\nwoman imploring cops not to tow her scooter as they're ignoring her and \r\nhoisting it onto a tow truck.)\u00a0 Advertisement Incredibly,\r\n though, considering how unpleasant many of the situations are, this is a\r\n different, vastly less oppressive feeling than we get from watching \r\nlater features by the director, such as \"What Time is There?\", \"The \r\nRiver\" and last year's \"Stray Dogs\"\u2014works in which the artist's gaze is \r\nmore merciless, his shots more carefully composed and held at much \r\ngreater length, and the characters' psychodrama even more pitilessly \r\nobserved, to the point where you feel as though you're watching a whole \r\nsociety being figuratively drawn-and-quartered on a coroner's \r\nexamination table. Here, when we watch lives of the student, his \r\nparents, the two petty thieves and their tag-along gal pal\u00a0Ah Kuei (Wang\r\n Yu-wen), the circumstances feel awfully dire a lot of the time\u2014the \r\nthieves' \u00a0apartment remains flooded throughout the film, and you often \r\nsee debris and dead cockroaches floating on the surface of the water\u2014and\r\n yet the youthful energy of the characters and the sheer ominous beauty \r\nof the movie's Tapei locations make the story, such as it is, feel oddly\r\n bouncy.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Wetlands", "Review": "\u201cWetlands\u201d is a film that wants to work in two ways: as a drama about a man desperately attempting to reestablish ties to his justifiably estranged teenage daughter, and as a gritty modern-day film noir filled with drugs, murder, gangsters, infidelity and even a genuine femme fatale thrown in for good measure. If first-time filmmaker Emanuele Della Valle had focused on one of these approaches, he might have come up with a reasonably compelling final product. But by shoving the two together and then tossing a couple of highly unnecessary subplots into the mix, he instead comes up with a terribly uneven narrative that doesn\u2019t especially work as drama or noir and which manages to waste a pretty good cast in the bargain. Advertisement   Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje stars as Babs Johnson (short for Babel, mind you), a one-time top cop in Philadelphia until he got himself caught up in a web of drug addiction and corruption that eventually led to an act so heinous that we are only informed of it via a gradually expanding flashback\u2014in black-and-white, no less\u2014running throughout the film proper. A year or so later, a newly sober Babs turns up in Atlantic City to work as a detective for the local police force in the hopes of reconnecting with ex-wife Savannah (Heather Graham) and their teenaged daughter Amy (Celeste O\u2019Connor). This will prove to be a little more difficult to pull off than he thinks. Amy quite rightfully resents the fact that her father bailed on her for so long and now thinks he can get back into her good graces with such tokens as an ice cream cone or a fishing trip. As for Savannah, she is still bitter at her ex and is now romantically involved with a younger woman who is known only as Surfer Girl (Reyna de Courcy), who dreams of one day leaving the Garden State behind to head off to California to open her own surf shop.   While trying to mend fences in his personal life, Babs spends his professional hours trying to bring an end to the area\u2019s thriving drug trade that is being run by local gangsters Jimmy Coconuts (Louis Mustillo) and Lollipop (Barry Markowitz). This also proves to be a little trickier than it seems because not only do the gangsters appear to be paying off the top cops in town, they also have Babs\u2019 motormouth partner (Christopher McDonald) under their thumbs due to extensive gambling debts. To complicate matters even further, Babs discovers that Surfer Girl is also tied up in the local drug trade and has been courting danger by repeatedly shortchanging Jimmy and Lollipop in their dealings, a move that could end up putting Savannah and Amy in danger as well. Things quickly go sideways and when a dead body eventually turns up, all signs point to Babs as the killer. Oh yeah, while all of this is going on, a late-season hurricane is threatening to hit the area with unexpected and potentially metaphorical force.   \u201cWetlands\u201d would clearly love to come across as a contemporary version of the classic film noirs that actors like the great Robert Mitchum used to crank out with offhand ease back in the day (though I seriously doubt that Mitchum would have ever consented to playing a character named Babs Johnson). Instead, the crime aspect of the story does not add up to much\u2014those scenes feel oddly truncated (when the key murder finally occurs, the film has only about 15 minutes or so to wrap it up) and what we do see offers nothing in the way of surprise. (Even that traumatic flashback, once finally revealed in full, will not raise too many eyebrows.) The more personal stuff doesn\u2019t work either because we never get any sense of the struggles Babs must be going through in trying to keep it together and show his ex-wife and daughter that he is once again worthy of their trust. Instead of fleshing out either of these areas, the screenplay instead wastes time on such dramatically pointless elements as Babs\u2019 clandestine relationship with his partner\u2019s wife (Jennifer Ehle), a newscaster who constantly pops diet pills in the hopes that she will not be replaced by someone younger, prettier and thinner. Then there is that hurricane, which is hyped to be a key element of the story but then peters out without making much of an impact. After this effort and Brian De Palma\u2019s otherwise great 1998 film \u201cSnake Eyes,\u201d perhaps filmmakers should just agree that thrillers about murder and corruption in Atlantic City and hurricane subplots just do not mix. Advertisement   \u201cWetlands\u201d has a number of good actors but none of them are served especially well by the script. Akinnuoye-Agbaje provides an undeniably strong presence that is almost too much for the thin character he is playing while McDonald certainly makes an impression with a cheerfully odd performance that is arguably the best thing on display here. Heather Graham, on the other hand, is given virtually nothing to do but since it is nice to have Graham on the big screen in a major role for the first time in a while, I am willing to overlook that. On the other end of the scale, de Courcy, playing the character who is supposed to tie everything together, is one of the less distinctive femme fatales to come along in a while. The worst performance, however, is delivered by Ehle, who is not convincing for a single second as a newscaster, a lover or even as a plausible human being. To be fair, her character is so badly conceived\u2014she seems to have been jammed into the narrative only to get Babs out of a tight spot with an admission of their affair\u2014that Ehle should probably be commended simply for keeping a straight face throughout.   Other than the novelty of being the only example of a gritty crime drama featuring a key male character named Babs, there is absolutely nothing interesting or memorable to be found in \u201cWetlands.\u201d The whole thing feels like the busted pilot to a mediocre television show and it is too blah to even get especially upset with, except in regard to the squandering of its actors."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Small, Beautifully Moving Parts", "Review": "Sarah Sparks is your friendly local technology guru. She can debug your computer, teach you how your cell phone works and repair your toaster. She seems compelled to disassemble every device she comes across, and when she uses a drugstore pregnancy test, she\u2019s fascinated by the typeface used on the product. The part she can\u2019t deal with is her pregnancy. She has no interest in babies and no desire to become a mother. The baby growing within her is like a computer bug that has invaded her hard drive. Her boyfriend Leon (Andre Holland) is thrilled. So is her father Henry (Richard Hoag). So is her sister Emily (Sarah Rafferty), who throws her a shower in L.A. Also Leon\u2019s sister Towie (Susan Kelechi Watson), who joins her in Las Vegas for a few days to offer massages and pick up the vibes of her chi. Advertisement \u201cSmall, Beautifully Moving Parts,\u201d written and directed by Annie Howell and Lisa Robinson, is effortlessly engaging in introducing us to these people. That\u2019s possibly because Anna Margaret Hollyman, who plays Sarah, has a lovable screen presence. In this early leading role of a brief career, she has the sort of charm we felt from the first films of Sandra Bullock or Greta Gerwig. She deals with a lot of emotions in the film\u2019s compact running time, and always feels natural and spontaneous. After learning she\u2019s pregnant, she becomes obsessed with motherhood, and her own mother, who disappeared from her life years ago. She learns vaguely that her mom is living \u201coff the map\u201d somewhere in the Nevada desert. Leon encourages Sarah to contact her, but her father and sister advise against it. Her father confesses he\u2019s baffled by the behavior of his former wife. Sarah perhaps unwisely sets off alone to drive off the map and back into her mother\u2019s life. This takes her near the Grand Canyon, where she snaps a family photo of some tourists and quizzes them like she\u2019s Errol Morris doing a blog on photography: \u201cIs taking family photos a way to run away from despair?\u201d  The deeper Sarah penetrates into the wilderness, the more her technology fails her. The GPS gives up. Her phone battery runs out. When she finally arrives at the Dome, which her mother is said to inhabit, she\u2019s been reduced to just \u2026 herself. The pleasure of everything up until this point has been intrinsic. Hollyman and the other actors are good company, and an obsession with technology could inspire a complete film. (Indeed, it has: Darren Aronofsky\u2019s \u201cPi\u201d comes to mind.) But when Sarah finally encounters her mother (Mary Beth Peil), the movie itself goes off the map, in a good way. It offers no answers, no facile psychological observations, just the mystery of personality. So I must not discuss those scenes. This is a small film and knows exactly how to be a small film. Like many New Yorker short stories, its purpose is to strike a particular note and allow it to reverberate. Life is made up of challenges that cannot be solved but only accepted. And Sarah will discover that her child will need a lot more maintenance than a microwave oven. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Bushwick", "Review": "This movie will lose the goodwill of any longtime New Yorker watching it within the first ten minutes. Under the opening credits, there are a series of relatively pleasant helicopter views of Brooklyn, starting from the shores of Coney Island. But these grow more sinister as we note the presence of a machine-gun barrel in the bottom of the frame. Yikes. Then: cut to an underground subway station. Church Avenue, service by the G and F lines, as the visible signage shows. Lucy, played by Brittany Snow, is wending her way to the exit, with her milquetoast boyfriend, played by Some Dude\u2122. They\u2019re mildly concerned because there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone around but otherwise are feeling jokey about milquetoast boyfriend\u2019s impending introduction to Lucy\u2019s grandmother. Their reverie is interrupted by a screaming man, his body entirely on fire, running down from the subway\u2019s street level stairs.  Advertisement (Side note: I know that screaming-man-on-fire is a favorite shock effect of hack filmmakers the world over, but \u201cstop drop and roll\u201d is a real-life thing, unlike \u201cshooting zombies in the head is the only way to kill them,\u201d which is only a movie thing. Stop, drop and roll works. I once set my entire forearm on fire in a lighter fluid mishap, and I stopped, dropped and rolled instinctually, and it worked! Why don\u2019t more movie characters try this?) Now sensible people might react to this sight by going back down to the track level and getting the next train to somewhere else, but Lucy and milquetoast boyfriend have to check out the situation, because apparently Grandma is hung up on punctuality. No sooner does milquetoast boyfriend get to the sidewalk than he too is incinerated. Lucy, whose grandmother must be really very strict, goes to the sidewalk anyway, to see an overturned flaming Mr. Softee truck, and varied parties shooting and blowing stuff up.  So she runs, and is pursued into a basement by two street menaces. One is white, or white-ish, while the other is black. For balance. Although the black one ends up being the more sexual-assault-menacing one. Interrupting this unsavory bit of race-baiting is Dave Bautista, an ex-Marine named \u201cStupe,\u201d who owns the basement in which the rape is considered. He dispatches the villains briskly, but he\u2019s not particularly friendly to Lucy, at least not at first.  As for the thing that will have New Yorkers checking out: When Lucy comes out of the subway station, she is indeed in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn; she runs past Jefferson Avenue\u2019s fabled Owl Juice Pub and other landmarks. Only problem is that the Church Avenue station from which she supposedly emerges isn\u2019t anywhere near Bushwick. Lucy later tells Stupe that she came in on the L train; as seen on the signage at the beginning of the movie, the Church Street station services the G and F. What\u2019s the big deal? Ask Martin Scorsese. He has recounted in several interviews how nuts it used to drive him, in old Hollywood movies, to see a couple turn a corner in Greenwich Village and wind up strolling down the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. But there\u2019s a deeper problem at work. Nick Damici and Graham Reznick, the screenwriters, seem to have based their portrayal of this transforming neighborhood in the county of Kings entirely on viewings of that old sensationalist TV cop drama \u201cBrooklyn South,\u201d which worried parents used to cite to their children when they wanted to dissuade them from moving to the borough.  Advertisement Additionally, they seem to have written their dialogue by typing out \u201cWe gotta get the f**k out of here!\u201d into their Final Draft document, copying that, and then pasting it onto each page, two or three times. For some reason they have crafted an inadvertently hilarious exchange between its two main characters: \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cHoboken.\u201d  Lucy is an entitled, petulant dolt whose most interesting trait is that she doesn\u2019t go into shock despite conditions that would put her there multiple times. Stupe is a stock Bautista type: taciturn, grunty, all that. He\u2019s an ex-Marine who\u2019s supposed to have Rambo-esque skills (and of course somebody makes a point of mentioning the Stallone character, for \u201cverisimilitude,\u201d I guess), but when he deigns to teach Lucy how to use a gun, he never shows her where the safety is.  The movie\u2019s main feature is a group of long-take, moving-camera action scenes that I guess might have been more engaging had the characters on the run and in battle been figures you wanted to spend any time with. They\u2019re not. These set pieces are either getting much easier to do, or they are the sole talent of co-directors Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott, because the filmmakers distinguish themselves in precisely zero other ways. The obnoxious, opportunistic premise is a menace-from-within scenario that\u2019s laughable even in the wake of certain current events. The numbskull faux nihilism of the ending is possibly intended as a homage to a recently departed horror movie director, but it\u2019s more like a callow insult."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri", "Review": "Anger is an energy in Martin McDonagh\u2019s brilliant \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d one of the best films of the year. In this \u201cSouthern American with an Irish attitude\u201d story from the \"In Bruges\" writer/director that, like a lot of his work, recalls Flannery O\u2019Connor in tone (the O'Connor quote \"The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it\" could be this movie's tagline), anger is not treated like something to be cured. Hollywood likes to teach us that anger is a sin, and that only through acceptance and understanding can we find true happiness. Easier said than done, right? How can you not be angry at an unfair world? Life will take children before parents. Life will give cancer to relatively young people. Life will be racist, sexist, and cruel. And you should throw a few back and yell at something that unfair. You should fight. It is only through that fighting and that rage that other emotions like empathy and understanding can surface. Anger is not a disease to be cured but a path on the road to comprehending the world. Advertisement No one does angry better than Frances McDormand, who does her best film work here since \u201cFargo\u201d as Mildred Hayes, a recently divorced mother who lost her daughter Angela less than a year ago. Angela was raped and murdered, but the case has gone cold. There was no matching DNA, so the spotlight has dimmed and Mildred is getting no updates. She\u2019s angry. She should be. One day, she sees three barren billboards on a rarely-traveled road, and she rents the space to ask the local chief of police, played by Woody Harrelson, why there are no answers. Local media becomes interested in the billboards, and the attention sparks a series of events involving not only the chief but one of his more loathsome officers, played by Sam Rockwell. Peter Dinklage, Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish, Lucas Hedges, Clarke Peters, and John Hawkes fill out a ridiculously perfect supporting cast. You might think you have your finger on what this will be like from that description, but McDonagh\u2019s simply perfect script is never quite what you expect it to be. The mystery of what happened to Angela would have dominated other versions of this story, but this is not really that movie. On one level, it is more about cause and effect than crime and resolution. Mildred rents the billboards, which leads to pressure on the chief, which leads to anger from his loyal officer, and so on and so on down the line. McDonagh spares no one, allowing almost all of his characters to be deeply flawed, especially McDormand\u2019s Mildred and Rockwell\u2019s Dixon. Life has screwed over both of these people, and it has made them both angry. Mildred is channeling her anger to solve her daughter\u2019s murder. Dixon has less of an idea of what to do with his, but one senses early on that it\u2019s probably going to eventually cost him his job. Rockwell often plays nice guys, but he\u2019s more effective here as a racist, violent cop than you might expect. He looks older and pudgier, like he drinks himself to sleep every night and doesn\u2019t really trust that life has much in store for him. Rockwell has a big arc in this film and he takes no false steps, as usual. Harrelson is great too, but the film belongs to McDormand, who can do more with a withering glare than most actresses can do with a monologue. She is simply stunning when it comes to internal language, so often revealing the pain underneath the rage. Her Mildred takes no prisoners, but also feels like someone literally torn apart inside by grief. McDormand can destroy a monologue, too\u2014a scene with a priest offering counsel is an all-timer, earning applause at my screening\u2014but she\u2019s even more impressive in the minor beats. It\u2019s the curl of a lip to fight back tears or the downward glance to stop herself from punching someone. This character is so completely, fully realized in ways that other actresses couldn\u2019t have come anywhere close to capturing. It\u2019s stunning to watch. Advertisement Of course, McDonagh deserves a ton of credit for not only directing her but giving her such a great part in such a smart script. Empathy and peace with the too-common injustice of our world is a common theme in cinema, but it\u2019s usually handled with kid gloves or pat resolutions. There are no easy answers in McDonagh\u2019s world\u2014no clear-cut heroes and villains. You will start to question Mildred and you will start to defend Dixon. In a sense, that\u2019s one of McDonagh\u2019s most stunning tricks with this film. The world is more complex than most movies would have you think, and it takes a writer of his remarkable ability to convey that. He\u2019s also operating at a more technically accomplished level than ever before, particularly in the way the film uses a great score from Coen regular Carter Burwell and well-balanced cinematography from Ben Davis. Not every speedbump given us by life teaches us tolerance. A daughter shouldn\u2019t die at all, much less brutally. But what do we do with that knowledge? How do we channel our anger at an unjust world? \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d is one of those truly rare films that feels both profound and grounded; inspirational without ever manipulatively trying to be so. Very few recent movies have made me laugh and cry in equal measure as much as this one. Very few films recently are this good. This review originally ran from the Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2017."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Death Sentence", "Review": "When he was asked by Johnny Carson how a magazine could quote him saying he really would murder to avenge his family, Charles Bronson looked Carson in the eye and said, \"Because the quote is accurate. I really could, and I would.\" There was a little silence then, because Bronson was totally convincing. He was publicizing \"Death Wish\" (1974), his film about a man whose wife is killed and daughter raped. He gets a gun and starts posing as bait for muggers, a middle-aged guy with a bag of groceries. Then he shoots them dead. I think he kills about 11 victims (17 in the book) and is nicknamed \"The New York Vigilante,\" but the homicide rate drops 50 percent in New York, and so a cop cuts him a deal: Get out of town. As the film ends, he's drawing a bead on a guy in Chicago. Advertisement Funny thing. When Bronson made \"Death Wish II\" (1982), it was set in Los Angeles, even though Brian Garfield, the author of the novel Death Wish, had written a 1975 sequel, Death Sentence, set in Chicago. Ah, yes, here's my copy right here, dedicated to \"Jay Robert Nash, John McHugh, Roger Ebert and Bill Granger, Chicago front-pagers all, with thanks.\" He was thanking us because he'd come to Chicago to research the city (in two days, as I recall), and we agreed to meet him at the Billy Goat to feed him the real dope. The Goat (\"no fries, cheeps\") is a hamburger-and-booze emporium tucked away on the lower level of Michigan Avenue, responsible for the enticing aroma of frying onions that pedestrians enjoy in front of the Wrigley Building. You will recognize the tavern on the book's Page 27, \"a block from Tribune Tower and equidistant from the Sun-Times and Daily News press rooms.\" His hero figures police reporters who hang out there \"might be the best source of information about the unfamiliar city.\" He carries his beer to the back of the bar, where \"there were nine or 10 men and women roughed up by alcohol and cigarettes and the cynicism of insider's experience.\" He got the Billy Goat right. Bronson went on to make \"Death Wish 3\" (1985), \"Death Wish 4\" (1987) and \"Death Wish V\" (1994), by which date he was 73 and didn't need the bag of groceries as bait. They were set variously in Los Angeles and New York, largely filmed in Toronto, and never did get back to Chicago, reportedly because Garfield hated the first movie and its sequels so much he would never sell the rights to Death Sentence. But now here at last, in 2007, is \"Death Sentence,\" and it is filmed in, that's right, South Carolina. It doesn't follow the book, either. Kevin Bacon steps into the Bronson role, although curiously, even with the real sequel to work with, his name is changed from Paul Benjamin to Nick Hume. In the movie's first press releases, he was John Hume. In the Bronson movies, he was Paul Kersey. There is always a legal reason for these things. I favor John Paul. Probably another bad idea. You may have no interest in the information I've shared so far, but I'll bet you don't read it anywhere else. Probably a reason for that, too. Everything that follows will be a spoiler of one sort or another, unless you have already guessed that John, I mean Nick, has lost a close family member, obtains a gun that would stop a charging locomotive and goes out for revenge. In the older movies, the killing mostly amounted to the hero shooting people, but \"Death Sentence\" is directed by the Australian James Wan (\"Saw,\" \"Dead Silence\"), who has a much more sensational line in violence. Advertisement In the Bronson movies, the hero just looked more and more determined until you felt if you tapped his face, it would explode. In \"Death Sentence,\" Bacon acts out a lot more, scaring his wife (Kelly Preston) and drawing the attention of a police detective (Aisha Tyler), who you would think, at a crucial point, would think to ask Nick why he has a blood-soaked bandage wrapped around his hand. Probably just smashed a mirror in grief. Wan's movie is very efficient. Bacon, skilled pro that he is, provides the character the movie needs, just as he has in such radically different films as \"Where the Truth Lies,\" \"The Woodsman\" and \"Mystic River.\" John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund are creepy and scary as the gun dealer Bones Darley and his skinhead son, Billy. Bones is the kind of gun dealer who looks like he would like to demonstrate his merchandise on you, and Billy is the kind of kid who is not satisfied with tattoos crawling up his neck but also has one of those goatees that tells you, \"I am either a perverted madman, the leader of a suicidal cult, or terrified you will not notice me.\" There is a courtroom scene of true surprise and suspense, and some other effective moments, but basically this is a movie about a lot of people shooting at each other, and during the parts I liked, the action audience will probably go out to get popcorn, or a tattoo or something."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Settlers", "Review": "Shimon Dotan\u2019s \u201cThe Settlers\u201d is a potent if problematic look at the hundreds of thousands of people, mainly Israeli Jews but also a few scattered Christians, who live on Arab lands occupied by Israel. The film starts out acknowledging how tricky the issue is by asking some of its subjects if they are settlers. The term is evidently a charged one. While some embrace it unapologetically, one man says he prefers \u201cinhabitant.\u201d But the real nub comes when one interviewee responds that the term itself belongs to \u201cleftists and the media.\u201d There you have the split that makes even talking about the issues that surround the settlements so difficult: While much of the world has condemned their continued expansion and the problems they represent to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the possibilities of a two-state solution, in Israel itself the left and right of the political spectrum reject each other\u2019s basic premises for understanding the situation. Advertisement It\u2019s ironic that, though their meanings are very different, both sides see the essential problem as resulting from an intrusion of European values upon Middle Eastern realities. For some left-leaning academics interviewed in the film, the religious-minded settlers are mistakenly embracing a kind of Western nationalism that sees land, rather than faith, as the foundation of identity. For the settlers and their rightist backers, who regard the territories they call Judea and Samaria as part of their Biblical birthright, the real European intrusion is the idea of democracy. Everything would be fine, one defender of the settlers says, if people didn\u2019t think Arabs should have political rights. This conflict points back to an innate duality in the original concept of Zionism. On one hand, the idea was to provide a homeland for the Jewish people. On the other hand, most of its first proponents saw their envisioned state as being democratic-socialist in its political nature. The pressure being put in Israel currently by the settler movement, as many have observed, results from the way it forces these two ideas onto a violent collision course. Among the curious features of \u201cThe Settlers\u201d that may inspire certain reservations among viewers are the number of issues and personalities it never mentions. These range from the Holocaust to Benjamin Netanyahu. Indeed, the half-century history of the Zionist project prior to the founding of Israel in 1948 goes unexamined. For most of its length, the film traces the history of the settler movement, using archival footage, and interviews with various academics, political figures and settlers both prominent and ordinary, old and young. While it notes that the United Nations Partition Plan of 1947 called for the British Mandate of Palestine to be divided into Jewish and Arab states, the film\u2019s narrative really begins in 1967 with a highly emotional speech by Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, who lamented the Jews' loss of contact with holy sites in the West Bank. When the Six-Day War of a month later gave Israel control of both the West Bank and Gaza, many of Kook\u2019s followers came to regard his words as prophetic; the ideology of the settler movement was the result. Advertisement As the film shows, early Israeli governments opposed the settler project and its practical consequences. But when one politician spoke airily of being able to contain \u201ca few dozen crazy Jews,\u201d the settlers\u2019 response was to come in the hundreds, then the thousands. Soon enough, there were enough \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d that a succession of governments began to accommodate their demands in ways that would make the prospect of returning the land to Arab control increasingly difficult. From early on, it\u2019s clear that some settlers are motivated primarily by religion. These range from the pioneer generation who wanted to reestablish contact with sites like the Cave of the Patriarchs and the city of Hebron to modern-day, mostly young \u201chilltop\u201d settlers who are literally trying to claim the high ground in what remains of the Arab West Bank. Most of these people come across as self-evidently sincere, although of varying degrees of candid racism and fanaticism. Among the more extreme are some who see Israel eventually expanding to include all lands between the Nile and the Euphrates. But there are also settlers who seem more motivated by bourgeois creature comforts and economic advantage, and whose influx to the West Bank has driven their numbers close to the half-million mark. These people are looking for nice places to live that cost far less than houses in Tel Aviv and the coastal cities. The Israeli government has increasingly catered to their demands by building sleek, modern, Jews-only highways and bridges that allow them to whisk from their West Bank homes to Jerusalem in minutes, without having to see any borders or the misery of their Arab neighbors. It\u2019s the willful moral blindness symbolized by this transformation of an ancient landscape that is finally the most striking and disturbing aspect of the film, one that will probably satisfy neither side in the ongoing debate over the settlements. Whatever its limitations, though, \u201cThe Settlers\u201d provides a vivid primer on a situation that looks inherently tragic."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame", "Review": "Detective Dee is a sleuth in China during the Tang Dynasty, circa 690. Like Sherlock Holmes, he based his detection largely on acute observation. He became famous in 17 mystery novels by Robert van Gulik, and now here he is in an extravaganza by Tsui Hark, a master of the choreography of action. \"Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame\" is a bewitching fantasy. The empress Wu Zetian is about to become the first woman to ascend the Imperial Throne, but powerful forces scheme against her. A woman as head of state was no more thinkable in China in 690 than it is in America today. The construction of a towering statue of a giant Buddha is being hurried toward completion before her coronation day, when progress is interrupted by the spontaneous human combustion of one of its designers. Much as I persist in doubting it, such a form of death is allegedly possible, but surely there is no precedent for a series of them at such a touchy time. Advertisement It appears to be the perfect crime, if it is a crime. The victims combust in full view with no one nearby. There are of course no murder weapons. The cause is unknown, although it seems to happen in sunlight. This is a case for the greatest investigator in the land, and so Wu Zetian (Carina Lau) summons Detective Dee (Andy Lau) from the imperial prison, whence she cast him some years ago. As heroes in such situations often do, Detective Dee is forgiving, is still loyal to her and has apparently only improved his skills during confinement. Now the stage is set for an epic of martial-arts action on a lavish scale, using vast sets which are both real and CGI. Tsui Hark is a genius of this genre, going back to the \"Chinese Ghost Story\" movies circa 1990 and nearly 60 other films, including \"The Swordsman\" and \"Once Upon a Time in China\" and its sequels. This film may represent the largest budget in his career, and one wonders how much of that went into the bizarre hair stylings of the empress. On the basis of its scale, energy and magical events, this is the Hong Kong equivalent of a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. But it transcends them with the stylization of the costumes, the panoply of the folklore, the richness of the setting, and the fact that none of the characters (allegedly) have superpowers. All the characters are presented as presumably real, with the exception of a talking stag \u2014 which, since it is an imperial stag, I suppose is permitted.  Detective Dee is assigned three assistants he is not sure he can entirely trust: Zhong (Tony Leung Ka-fai), who is an expert on the design and construction of the Buddha, and notices the missing scrolls; Jing'er (Li Bingbing), who enjoys the empress' favor, and Pei (Chao Deng), a police official who seems fixed in a state of constant brooding. They debate with great energy while Dee listens and observes (as Holmes did), but events move inexorably toward disaster, as victims continue to incinerate, and it is discovered that the giant Buddha is just exactly high enough that if it fell in the wrong direction, it would land precisely on the site of the planned coronation. By this point there's no reason to doubt that it would fall in that direction. Advertisement Tsui Hark began with the traditional techniques of martial-arts films, with athletic stars using concealed trampolines and invisible overhead wires to supplement their own considerable skills. One of the pleasures of watching traditional Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan films is that in many cases, the stars were actually doing what they seemed to be doing, much aided by editing and camera angles. Now those methods have been rendered obsolete by CGI, and the characters can leap any distance, defy gravity and virtually change direction in mid-air (when the laws of physics make that impossible). The humans here are as skilled as \u2014 well, as Kung Fu Panda.  The result lacks the exhilaration of watching Jackie Chan climb a wall or leap onto a truck in real time, but there's an undeniable fluid grace. And masters like Tsui Hark prefer their action to have a certain visual continuity and not be fragmented into the incomprehensible bits of action employed by Michael Bay. His camera is also disciplined; his wide-screen compositions are elegant and almost classical, given the tumult on the screen. That said, the movie exists very much in the moment, and although an attempt is made to flash back and reconstruct what must have happened, such explanations are required only by the conventions of the genre. In a way, Detective Dee is Sherlock Holmes, and we in the audience are slow-witted Watsons."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Boyhood", "Review": "The second shot of \"Boyhood\" doubles as the movie's poster image: a young child named Mason, Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) lying on his back in green grass, staring at the sky. He does not speak and there is no voice-over narration, so we cannot know what's in his head. But the movie is contemplating, among other things, the fleeting nature of existence\u2014the way that time, to quote \"Life Itself,\" slips through your fingers like a long silk scarf.\u00a0 \"Boyhood\" became the instant subject of media buzz last year when Linklater revealed that he'd been working on the project for 12 years, following the same actors (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the hero's parents, Olivia and Mason, Sr., and the director's daughter Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha) through the early part of the 21st century. We watch the children grow up and the adults thicken and grey. We see Olivia and Mason, Sr. in various relationships. Olivia is looking to replace her ex-husband and make her \"broken\" family intact again, and this search leads her into a series of arrangements that are wrong for her, sometimes horribly so. Mason, Sr., goes the other way, acting the role of bohemian free-spirit even as he works a series of rather typical jobs. The kids get taller and become interested in particular subjects, and in sex, and after a while they start to think about college and what they want to do with their lives.\u00a0 Advertisement It's all a blur. The blur is indescribably moving. We've seen people age in movies and on TV programs\u2014the kids in the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Up\" series, for instance, and little Ronny Howard on \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" and Kiernan Shipka on \"Mad Men\"\u2014but we've never seen it happen in such a compact span of screen time. That's what makes \"Boyhood\" singular. There is no other work to which one can directly compare it without distorting pop culture history. This movie is truly its own thing, as eccentrically unique as Linklater's breakthrough \"Slacker,\" another Austin-set feature to which \"Boyhood\" feels (curiously) like a companion piece, or perhaps a bookend. Mason is a child of divorce. He and his mother and his sister move around a lot, all over Texas, a U.S. state as big as France. Mason's dad does not have custody, so has to accommodate his wife's shifts in geography over the years, sometimes driving hundreds of miles to see his children. \u00a0Even though Olivia and Mason, Jr. love their kids, there are moments when they resent them, because once they had them they were locked into a particular track and had to put their kids first, always. The trick, though\u2014and this is where Linklater the writer shows how generous and kind he is\u2014lies in realizing that sometimes when parents think they're putting their kids first they're really responding to conditioning, or doing what their society or their gender or their parents told them was the correct thing to do. The movie's about social conditioning as well as time. It asks basic, deep questions. What makes us \"normal\"? Is there such a thing as \"normal\"? What makes us identify as men, as women, as children? Is the traditional domestic arrangement\u2014a wife, a husband and kids living in the same house\u2014really desirable for every person, and genuinely good for society, or does it inflict distress on those whose personalities and desires cannot function within it? Two important men in Olivia's life have drinking problems; alcoholism is a disease, but it's also a means of forgetting, of numbing pain, of denial. \u00a0Do we really change over time? Can we decide to change ourselves? Or is free will an illusion? \u00a0Do we seize moments or do moments seize us? (\"You are responsible for your own actions,\" warns a sign hanging in the hero's elementary school.)\u00a0 Advertisement Olivia seems, like many single moms, dispirited by the the responsibilities she bears. Early on we hear her arguing with her boyfriend, a single man who resents that she can't just come and go as she pleases, as he does. (\"I was somebody's daughter, and then I was somebody's fucking mother,\" she says.) She's chasing an idea of normalcy that may not be right for her. In an intense scene that occurs in a car outside of a school, not long after a period of domestic strife, Olivia asks for understanding because she's trying to build \"a family\" with a new boyfriend, and Mason exclaims, \"We already have a family!\"\u2014and he's right. Olivia is a college professor and a liberal feminist, but she's still bought into the husband-and-wife-and-two-kids-equals-a-real-family thing. She studies \"unconditioned response\" in one of her grad school courses but it takes a few years for her to figure out, in practical terms, what the phrase means. There are points near the end of \"Boyhood\" when\u00a0Olivia might remind you of George Bailey, the hero of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" Of the movie's two parents, she is nearly always the responsible one\u2014the \"boring\" one. Even her worst decisions were made for noble reasons, but the constraints that motherhood placed on her freedom always gnawed at her. Over time, though, she grows by leaps and bounds, finishing grad school and becoming a teacher and then a person of considerable influence in her community. We start to see the profound, lasting impact that her moral rectitude has had on the world. She evolves, as surely as her ex-husband and children evolve, but the process is subtler. It's not right out there, like her ex-husband's delayed maturation. The film's title and choice of protagonist have been criticized (gently but firmly) for unthinkingly confirming that heterosexual men are at the center of the universe. But this reading ignores the movie's constant (if empathetic) critique of American manhood, or what passes for American manhood: an entitled mental state that is really just boyhood with money and a driver's license. Mason, Sr., for all the love that he shows his kids, is an example of this. He's a great natural playmate for his son and daughter, joining them on the floor as they futz with toys and taking them on camping trips and trying to purchase their love with gifts as if every visitation were a miniature Christmas. But he doesn't express much real wisdom until his kids edge toward adolescence and become tight-lipped and undemonstrative, and he pulls the car over during a family trip to demand that they have real conversations (amusingly, Samantha makes the same request of him). \u00a0 Advertisement He has to learn to give in as well as to give\u2014and that giving in doesn't always have to mean giving up.\u00a0Even when Mason, Sr. is 30 or 40 he still lives like a 19-year old who just got his first place. He resents his ex-wife as a killjoy, and clings to his GTO the way little boys cling to their loveys. And yet\u00a0he matures onscreen along with his kids, mellowing over the years and becoming less strident and arrogant and more generous, learning that it's possible to be a person of integrity even if you aren't insisting that every single thing go your way at every single moment (a pattern of behavior that only narcissists mistake for freedom).\u00a0We get the sense that in some ways Mason the elder is un-learning what he learned during the first part of his life\u2014an experience that his kids are now going through, with different details. It's rough, this process. It's emotional boot camp, with versions of hazing. And I love how \"Boyhood\" admits that, in certain ways, growing up stinks. Every character has a least one moment in which they have to heed the advice of Corinthians and put away childish things. None of them like it. The adults in Mason, Jr.'s orbit (including his mother and father and various teachers and authority figures) all want to parent or mentor him by turning him into reflections or extensions of themselves. In high school, a photography teacher tells the budding shutterbug hero that he needs to move away from arty compositions and learn to shoot sports so that he can make a living, advice which assumes that Mason, Jr. wants to earn a living with photography rather than treating it as an avocation, or as the visual version of a diary. The manager of a restaurant where Mason, Jr. works as a dishwasher wants to groom him as a fry cook. The man's eyes light up as he describes this arc, as if he's moved by his own generosity. At various points during the boy's life he's pushed toward bad decisions by other boys who warn him that failure to act a certain way makes him a \"fag\" or a \"pussy.\" You sense the kid pushing back against these pressures. You realize that, for all their faults, and despite the geographical and emotional obstacles that they were up against, his parents did a good job raising him. Or maybe he absorbed their better qualities as if by osmosis. (Did he seize their better qualities, or did their better qualities seize him?) Linklater doesn't explain any of this\u2014the storytelling and filmmaking are intuitive; things that look like pointers or labels aren't\u2014and yet it's all there in the movie. You can feel it. Perhaps without meaning to, the film exemplifies the best piece of advice that anyone gives the hero: \"We're all just winging it.\" Advertisement \"Boyhood\" is broken into discrete dramatic chunks\u2014this is really an anthology of short movies with a recurring cast\u2014and there are no timestamps telling us that we've passed from 2002 into 2003 or from 2009 into 2010. We realize where we are on the timeline when we hear somebody talking about the Iraq war, or hear a song on the soundtrack that was big during a certain year, or realize that the boy has changed his haircut or gotten a little bit taller. The simultaneously nourishing and corrosive effects of time make the film quietly moving and humble-seeming, despite its three-hour length and conceptual audacity. Time is what makes the film cohere even when particular scenes, images or performances seem clunky or undernourished. Fixating on imperfections while discussing \"Boyhood\" would be as petty as criticizing the sculpting of individual stones in a cathedral.\u00a0The totality matters. Even more important is our recognition that the totality is as fleeting as life.\u00a0 Time, and our interaction with time, and the way in which we are all ultimately overmatched and worn down by time, and the notion of cinema as a means of sculpting with time: these and other aspects of temporality are at the heart of \"Boyhood.\" Time is the core around which all of this movie's musings on childhood and parenthood are woven. It's the river down which the scenes and characters travel without consciously realizing that they are on individual journeys that all have the same ending. If life is \"about\" anything, it's about realizing and accepting that fact: that everything is fleeting. Time gives birth and nourishes and then obliterates as it moves ahead, like the family which, in an early scene, prepares to move out of a house by covering murals and hand-lettered height charts with white paint. The film ends and the credits come up and you ask the same question that you ask at the end of an evening spent with old, dear friends: where did the time go?"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "In the Family", "Review": "\"In the Family\" centers on one of the notable performances I've seen \u2014 if, indeed, it is a performance. Perhaps Patrick Wang is exactly like that. Then he must be a very good man. He wrote, directed and stars in the film, but it's not a one-man show. It is about the meaning of \"family.\" This is his first feature, and may signal the opening of an important career. Wang plays Joey Williams, a Chinese-American man who has been living happily for about five years with Cody Hines (Trevor St. John) and Cody's 6-year-old son, Chip (Sebastian Banes). Chip's mother died in childbirth. Some months after that, to his own surprise, Cody fell in love with Joey, and they're raising Chip. This household is given enough screen time to establish it as a happy, healthy place. Advertisement Then Cody is killed in an accident. Chip stays with Joey, whose treatment of him is a study in wisdom and love. The boy is so irrepressibly joyous that we sense what a happy life he has led. But Cody's sister Eileen (Kelly McAndrew) reveals that her brother left a will years ago, granting her all of his property and custody of his child. This will, written after the death of Cody's wife and before he met Joey, has never been updated. On Thanksgiving Day, Joey drops the boy off at the sister's house and never sees him again. A lawyer in his Tennessee town tells him flatly he doesn't have a child custody case, and no judge in the state will rule in his favor. Neither this lawyer nor anyone else ever uses the words \"homosexual\" or \"gay.\" It isn't in any sense a \"gay rights\" film, nor is it an \"Asian-American\" film. It is about a father and son who have been separated against their wishes.  Its objectivity in these terms is possible because of Wang's extraordinary performance. I've been unable to discover any details about him, but he speaks in a relaxed, natural Tennessee accent and creates Joey as a particularly convincing character, a contractor who drives a red pickup truck. (Cody was a schoolteacher.) His own parents died when he was very young. He was adopted by foster parents, who gave him their name, and who died when he was a teenager. As a man of Asian birth who has been raised apart from other Asians, as an orphan and a foster child who for years had no family, we sense how important stability and continuity are to him.  And there is something else. Without ever making a point of it, he has been treated as an outsider. Wang, as director, indicates this by several scenes with the back of the character's head to the camera, so that we see the other characters from his POV, instead of seeing Joey mixed in visually. He is not a hothead, not neurotic, not psychologically damaged, but in this crisis, the entire basis of his being has been challenged. Having seen Cody, we can feel certain he would have granted custody to Joey if he had ever made another will. Cody's sister doesn't see it that way. What does she think about homosexuality? She never says. Advertisement Joey's case looks hopeless. Friends try to console him, but helplessly. He's working on a house for a local attorney who has an ornate law library, and he reveals his skills in bookbinding \u2014 an art learned from his foster father. This attorney, Paul Hawks (the authoritative and wise Brian Murray), offers his help and observes there may be no help within the court system but there may be a more human path around it. Then follows a scene of legal depositions, during which Patrick Wang's performance, in long takes that feel entirely spontaneous, recounts his life story. Joey's response to the offensively hostile attorney for the other side is masterful: He humiliates the other man simply by being a good person and telling the truth. \"In the Family\" is a long film, and truth to tell, could have been made shorter. (One dimly lit confrontation between Joey and a key participant seems unnecessary.) That said, I was completely absorbed from beginning to end. What a courageous first feature this is, a film that sidesteps shopworn stereotypes and tells a quiet, firm, deeply humanist story about doing the right thing. It is a film that avoids any message or statement and simply shows us, with infinite sympathy, how the life of a completely original character can help us lead our own."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Norwegian Wood", "Review": "\u201cI once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.\u201d \u2014 \u201cNorwegian Wood,\u201d by Lennon and McCartney There\u2019s something depressing about a young couple helplessly in love. Their state is so perfect, it must be doomed. They project such qualities on their lover that only disappointment can follow. Perhaps such truths help explain the success of Haruki Murakami\u2019s international best-seller Norwegian Wood. It\u2019s easier to identify with loss than love, because we have had so much more experience of it. The novel has been filmed by Tran Anh Hung, born in Vietnam, long resident in Paris; his \u201cThe Scent Of Green Papaya\u201d (1993) was a gorgeous romance I thought was one of the best films of that year. He seems to fall in love with his actors, finding beautiful faces and then caressing them in closeup. Advertisement Here he begins with two best friends and the girlfriend of one of them. (I thought of \u201cJules and Jim.\u201d) Life is joyous and carefree. Then Kizuki (Kengo Kora) commits suicide. At the risk of sounding crass, may I suggest he wanted to quit while he was ahead? Do suicidal young lovers realize that romance is short but death is long? Kizuki leaves behind his girlfriend, Naoko (Rinko Kikuchi), and his best friend, Toru Watanabe (Ken\u2019ichi Matsuyama). It feels wrong to them that they are only two. On her 20th birthday, Naoko loses her virginity to Toru and explains why Kizuki, who was so close to her ever since sixth grade, never made love with her. The reason is not what you may be thinking. Naoko disappears. Toru occupies himself with school, and then meets Midori (Kiko Mizuhara), a ribald girl who likes sex and flavors her speech with cheerful obscenities. Midori was the most popular character with the readers of Murakami\u2019s novel, probably because she wasn\u2019t as gloomy as the others. Here she is much toned down because Tran is more drawn to poignancy about the transience of happiness. Word comes that Naoko is living in some sort of retreat in a beautiful distant area, a place that seems halfway between a spa and a sanatorium. Here she is inseparable from an equally beautiful woman, a fellow patient who teaches music there. Toru comes to visit, and what follows between Naoko and him are dreamy scenes of languorous caresses and whispering poetic love talk. They are photographed in scenes of nature and snow, as if Tran seeks to create in his visuals the tenderness of their love. Let\u2019s hope Naoko doesn\u2019t learn about Midori. The naughty girl isn\u2019t all that important to Toru really, but she represents a flaw in Naoko\u2019s idea of Toru, and she is too fragile to sustain such a blow. I\u2019m sure there are ages and personalities that would find the young love in \u201cNorwegian Wood\u201d irresistible. Maybe a loving young couple would find their own story in it, as so many have found themselves in \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d There is something in the nature of director Tran Anh Hung, however, that seems to resist happy endings. In the emotional arc of his art, the high point seems to be bittersweet. It\u2019s sweet all the way up, wavers in dread and slides down to doom. The movie\u2019s cinematography, by Mark Lee Ping Bin, paints each frame in rapture. The actors are so attractive they could be models for Vogue, and perhaps they are; certainly they\u2019re effective in their roles, which require a lot of soft, intimate dialogue. There are a couple of points in the film when the Beatles song slips in; I wonder if Toru took note of this lyric: When I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Sacrament", "Review": "Low-budget horror tyro Ti West evokes Jonestown for a generation of viewers too young to remember the place, or the horrific event named for it, in \"The Sacrament.\" West is such a technically accomplished filmmaker, and his cast of semi-regulars so committed to the narrative, that the resultant movie gives enough unsettling atmosphere and upsetting gut-level shock that this viewer didn\u2019t mind too much all the stuff he wasn\u2019t getting, such as intellectual coherence, not to mention any kind of profound insight into the cult hive mind. Advertisement West sets his story in the present day. The movie\u2019s weakest sequence is its opening, done in faux-televised video style with static-punctuated jump cuts, showing a meeting at the offices of edgy media entity Vice (a written prologue explaining to the audience what Vice is ought to win a prize for Lamest Prose To Appear In A Motion Picture Nearly Ever) at which \"fashion photographer\" Patrick (Kentucker Audley) recounts to beardo editor Sam (A.J. Bowen) that his formerly drugged-out sister has quit the United States to live at some kind of sober commune that sounds kind of like a cult. Sam smells a story, so he, Patrick, and videographer Jake (filmmaker Joe Swanberg) set off to \"Eden Parish\" to check out the scene. There they find Patrick\u2019s sister Caroline (Amy Seimetz), now bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and clean, but a little freaked out by greeting a shoestring camera crew. She\u2019ll have to check with \"Father\" to see if these documentarians may be permitted to document. Folks of a certain age, or those who know a bit about nasty episodes in U.S. history, will have some idea of where this is going. The expression \"drank the Kool Aid,\" although historically inaccurate, has its roots in the Jonestown affair. Is that a spoiler? In any event, the intrigue is less in the tale than in the telling. The setup for the film suggests a \"Blair Witch\" style found-footage picture, but West wisely avoids that route. Yes, much of what we see is through the perspective of Jake, but as his character\u2019s a professional, it makes sense that the resultant digital video imagery straddles the ground between found-footage style rawness and more polished feature documentary style. This allows West the stylistic latitude to be more overtly expressive in his imagery. And to set up interestingly corresponding visuals against character observations such as \"this is nothing at all like the hippie commune we were expecting.\" Indeed, it is not, and the movie gains much power via the performance of the cast\u2019s oldest principal player, Gene Jones as the homey but steely \"Father.\" Jones has a background in voiceover, and his rich, mellifluous Southern tones imbue his character with a coziness that can turn sinister on a dime. In his eagerness to get on with the awfulness, West risks some plausibility complaints. The real Jonestown imploded after a year of investigations into the Guyana commune led by the Reverend Jim Jones (who, back in the day, was the subject of several fictionalized accounts, including the memorably titled \"Guyana: Cult of the Damned\"); in \"The Sacrament,\" they\u2019re mixing up the fruit drink after one night of scrutiny from the Vice crew. I know that people consider male urban hipster journalists pretty irritating, but come on. Once things build to a sickly conclusion, West takes advantage of the momentum to indulge in some pretty crass grindhouse exploitations. For all that, the movie gets its disreputable work done; not only will \"The Sacrament\" creep you out, it\u2019ll also make you want to shower. That\u2019s not nothing.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Sworn Virgin", "Review": "The concept being referred to in the title of \u201cSworn Virgin,\u201d a debut feature by Italian\r\nwriter-director Laura Bispuri, belongs to the traditional culture of Albania,\r\nwhere some of the film takes place. In a rugged, impoverished world where women\r\nare treated as chattel, some escape their hard, gender-determined fate\r\nby claiming the status of \u201csworn virgins\u201d before a dozen male elders, after\r\nwhich they don male garb and live as men. They are then allowed to carry rifles, hunt and engage in\r\nall privileged male activities, except one. They are not allowed to have sex\r\nwith either gender. This custom supposedly dates back at least a couple of\r\ncenturies and, though now dying is out, is still practiced by some women in\r\nAlbania\u2019s remote mountain villages. Advertisement The information given above would be a help to any viewer\r\ngoing into \u201cSworn Virgin.\u201d As it is, the film obliges viewers to puzzle out the\r\nnature of the sworn virgin tradition, and even at the tale\u2019s end, it may not be\r\nclear. This can only be counted a virtue by those who count obscurity and\r\nbafflement as artistic assets. The film\u2019s story has three strands, one present-tense and\r\nset in Italy, two set in Albania in years past. All three concern two Albanian\r\nsisters who have chosen different routes for escaping the gender-imposed\r\nhardships of their native culture. Lila (Flonja Kodheli) left Albania for Italy\r\nand a middle-class married life. When we meet her there, she has a teenage daughter\r\nnamed Jonida (Emily Ferratello). Years before, her sister Hana (Alba Rohrwacher) chose to\r\nlive as a sworn virgin named Mark. When the present-tense story opens, Mark\r\ncomes to Italy to visit Lila, still dressed as a man but evidently determined\r\nto start a new life away from her native culture. As we follow her tentative\r\nefforts to do this, the film repeatedly flashes back to the sisters\u2019 lives in\r\nAlbania as kids and around the age of 20, before Lila departs. The first thing to note about the film\u2019s central conceit is\r\nthat it makes \u201cSworn Virgin\u201d part of a long line of movies in which an actor\r\nplaying a character who\u2019s supposed to pass as a different gender is completely\r\nunconvincing.\u00a0Oddly enough, if that\u2019s a failure of sorts, it\u2019s one that\r\ndoesn\u2019t detract from the film\u2019s entertainment value and actually jibes with its\r\nthematic thrust. Whether or\u00a0not\u00a0we believe the actor as someone who successfully\r\npasses as a male, we get to compare our impressions to those of the people the\r\ncharacter meets, and reflect on the extent to which gender is performance, successful or not. Though its focus on blurred genders makes it part of a\r\nfashionable trend in movies, the film doesn\u2019t deliver much in the way of\r\ndramatic power or unexpected revelation, and its recurrent time-shifting, while\r\nintellectually apposite, further diminishes its narrative momentum. The most\r\nwinning aspects of Bispuri\u2019s approach involve details and subtle dramatic\r\ndevelopments, such as the evolving relationship between Mark/Hana and her\r\nniece, an Italian kid who\u2019s never known Albania. Though the niece is at first suspicious and\r\nresentful of this odd interloper, a sort of complicity emerges between\r\nthem. Advertisement The tale\u2019s most resonant setting is a public pool where\r\nfemale competitive swimmers must maintain a very specific high-gloss look, and\r\nwhere Mark is the one visitor who can never doff his clothes. It\u2019s in a\r\nbathroom there that he meets a guy who comes on to him apparently assuming he\u2019s\r\na boy\u2014a strange introduction to sex for a woman who would rather not be a\r\nmale. That reality underscores the fact that \u201cSworn Virgin\u201d is not\r\nthe tale of a transgender person. In fact, read from a political angle, its\r\nimplicit endorsement of gender birth roles can seem either unexamined or\r\nretrograde, though that may be putting too much weight on its rather simple\r\npremise. Another odd thing is that the sections in Albania (shot in\r\nthe aptly named Mountains of the Damned) don\u2019t delve into the role of religion.\r\nAre these folks Christian, Muslim or other, and do the local clerics approve of\r\nor ignore the sworn-virgin tradition? In most conservative rural societies like\r\nthis, religion plays a large and central role. But \u201cSworn Virgin\u201d is not the\r\nfirst film to give the impression that, in current European art cinema,\r\nreligion is the one subject that dare not speak its name."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Soul Surfer", "Review": "\"Soul Surfer\" is based on the true story of Bethany Hamilton, a champion surfer who in her early teens was attacked by a shark and lost almost all of her left arm. One month later, she was back on a surfboard, has since won several championships and is at age 21 a professional surfer. All of those are remarkable facts. My problem with \"Soul Surfer\" is that it makes it look too simple. Bethany (AnnaSophia Robb) has a loving family of professional surfers and a big, friendly dog. She lives in walking distance of the beach. She was and is a committed churchgoer and got great support from her spiritual leaders. She was an indomitable optimist with a fierce competitive spirit. Advertisement But there had to be more to it than that. I applaud her faith and spirit. I give her full credit for her determination. I realize she is a great athlete. But I feel something is missing. There had to be dark nights of the soul. Times of grief and rage. The temptation of nihilism. The lure of despair. Can a 13-year-old girl lose an arm and keep right on smiling? The flaw in the storytelling strategy of \"Soul Surfer\" is that it doesn't make Bethany easy to identify with. She's almost eerie in her optimism. Her religious faith is so unshaken, it feels taken for granted. The film feels more like an inspirational parable than a harrowing story of personal tragedy.  Even its portrait of her recovery and rehabilitation is perfunctory. There's a particularly unconvincing scene where she's fitted with a prosthetic arm and refuses to wear it. They're making remarkable progress in the field of prosthetics. But the arm that she's offered looks no more useful than the arm that she rips off her Barbie doll the same night (in one of the movie's rare moments of depression). Although I can understand a good prosthetic might not help her balance on a surfboard, I believe one might be of use in other situations \u2014 and I don't mean cosmetically. Maybe I'm mistaken.  Because Bethany actually was in the water a month after the attack, there can be no quarrel with those scenes in the film. What I missed was more information about her medical condition. What did her doctors advise? What risks were there to the wound? Having totaled almost a year in three trips through the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, I've known people who lost limbs and I know it's very difficult and complicated. Maybe Bethany was so young and resilient, and in such a happy situation with her family and her church, that it was this easy for her. But the movie feels too simple. Advertisement One of the best sequences in the film involves a trip that her church group makes to Thailand to bring aid and supplies to the survivors of a tsunami. This episode looks so realistic, it's uncanny. It has one detail that made me smile: Bethany packs cans of Spam for the victims. I don't know how you feel about Spam, but I know that in Hawaii, it's considered one of the basic food groups. (I like it with Colman's English Mustard \u2014 but I'm drifting.) \"Soul Surfer\" is a wholesome movie, intended as inspirational. Whether it will cheer viewers who are not as capable as Bethany is an excellent question. AnnaSophia Robb is a convincing, cheerful heroine. Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt, as Bethany's parents, are stalwart and supportive, although the script indeed leaves them with no other choice.  One character I question is Malina Birch (Sonya Balmores), one of Bethany's competitors, who sneers and is mean and does cruel things and, of course, always wears black. Why? Does she know that she has been cast as the villain?"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Happy New Year", "Review": "Expectations can be a burden, and \u201cHappy New Year\u201d is heavy\r\nladen: director Farah Khan and leading man Shahrukh Khan (no relation) have\r\nmade two prior features, 2004's \u201cMain Hoon Na\u201d and 2007's \u201cOm Shanti Om,\u201d that\r\nfall anywhere between \u201ca lot of fun\u201d and \u201call-time classic\u201d depending on whom\r\none asks, and there are plenty of people one can ask, as both films were\r\nenormously popular. Not to mention, Farah's choreography kept Shahrukh from\r\nfalling off the top of a train in \u201cDil Se.\u201d For Western audiences unfamiliar\r\nwith these titles, suffice to say, this director-star duo's reunion is A Very\r\nBig Deal. And, as if that wasn't enough, they've been developing, to some degree\r\nor other, \u201cHappy New Year\u201d for almost a decade. Advertisement While a compelling argument that expecting another \u201cOm\r\nShanti Om\u201d or a work of similarly awe-inspiring scale is setting the bar\r\nunfairly high, even resetting all factors to neutral, \u201cHappy New Year\u201d would be\r\na mysteriously sloppy piece of work. Its premise is a tantalizing one given\r\nthe director's immense skill as a choreographer and visual stylist and deft\r\nhand with comedy. The son of a convicted thief assembles a team to exact\r\nrevenge against the sinister tycoon who framed the father by stealing a set of\r\ninvaluable diamonds, which requires that the avengers enter a dance\r\ncompetition. The execution of that premise is extremely erratic; there are few\r\nmovies in living memory that ricochet between shockingly offensive comic business and utterly disarming hilarity as drastically as this one. It's that mercurial aspect to the comedy that causes\r\nhesitation before branding it outright as homophobic or racist. There are\r\nmean-spirited straight male gay panic gags side by side with awkward\u00a0 but clearly affectionate normalizing of gay\r\ndesire. There are truly shocking moments of racism toward East Asians\r\n(including a \u201cthey all look alike\u201d joke that, although scorned by another\r\ncharacter on-screen, is still a \u201cthey all look alike\u201d joke in 2014), side by\r\nside with a whole subplot about Shahrukh showing how progressive he is by being\r\nnice to a North Korean kid. Almost the entire first half of the movie, until the\r\nintermission, is a bit of a disaster. The second half, featuring more dancing\r\nand the fruition of the heist plot, is a good deal more fun. The heist\r\nsequences are tensely staged, goofily over-the-top convolution in the spirit of\r\n\u201cOcean's Eleven\u201d or Shahrukh Khan's own \u201cDon\u201d remake and sequel, defying logic\r\nand even rational linearity at every turn, and quite fun. But it's the dance\r\nsequences, featuring cortex-melting costume design and Farah Khan\r\nchoreography\u2014it's not her best work, but even a slightly off-her-game Farah\r\nKhan towers over mere mortals\u2014go a long way toward making the whole enterprise\r\nworthwhile. Advertisement That the sum total of the enterprise is \u201ca bunch of movie\r\nstars goofing off and dancing a bit\u201d shouldn't serve entirely as a dismissal.\r\nAbshishek Bachchan is a surprising standout in a dual role as the villain's\r\nlayabout son\u2014complete with blue contact lenses and a hilariously on-point\r\nAmerican accent\u2014and the out-of-control drunk the good guys recruit because he's\r\na dead ringer. Often a fatally stiff actor and atrocious dancer, Bachchan seems\r\nlike someone opened his physical comedy valve here, giving his loosest,\r\nfunniest performance in years, if not ever. And as for his dancing, well, the\r\nwhole point is that the heroes are bad dancers here. Deepika Padukone's role as\r\nthe professional brought in to whip them into shape is lamentably small and\r\nundemanding; hiring a star of her caliber for a role this undemanding is\r\noverkill. But that's one of \u201cHappy New Year\u201d's principal reasons for being:\r\neveryone in the movie is a star. This is not, to put it mildly, Shahrukh Khan operating at\r\nthe peak of his powers. That Padukone quotes one of his better moments (a\r\nmotivational speech he delivered to the girl's field hockey team he coached in\r\n\u201cChak De! India\u201d) with the genders flipped, before cutting to an annoyed\r\nreaction shot from SRK, says a lot about\r\nthe movie as a whole. That and other callbacks to his previous glories merely\r\nhighlight the degree to which he's on autopilot for much of the film here. But,\r\nas with the director, even sub-peak SRK is better than most. Where this differs\r\nis that there are a bunch of other movie stars visibly trying a lot harder\r\nright there in the same scenes with him. If \u201cHappy New Year\u201d inspires anyone to check out \u201cMain Hoon\r\nNa\u201d or \u201cOm Shanti Om,\u201d it will count as a success on that ground alone. On its\r\nown merits, it has some wildly fun dance sequences, some funny bits, and an\r\nimpressive roster of mainstream Bollywood talent. It's a shame that those\r\npositives can't entirely outweigh the messy, lazy and dumb stuff that pads out\r\nthe remainder of the running time."}

Like Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d this is a movie about a boxer that was shot in black-and-white. Like Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d this is a movie about a boxer that was shot in black and white and that is not a \u201cboxing movie\u201d despite being a movie about a boxer and having a fair amount of authentic-looking boxing recreations in it.  And all these similarities notwithstanding, \u201cThe Happiest Day in the Life of Olli M\u00e4ki,\u201d a Finnish film that\u2019s the debut feature from director Juho Kuosmanen, is the antithesis of \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d Perhaps all the similarities are there to underscore that point. Because Olli M\u00e4ki, the real-life boxer on whose biggest match this movie is based, is the antithesis of Jake LaMotta, the real-life basis of \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d Olli, a compact lightweight boxer played by the appealing Jarkko Lahti, is not a fellow prone to violence, battling inner demons and sexual jealousy. As his manager and hypeman Elis contends, he\u2019s a simple baker from Kokkola who\u2019s going to put Finland on the map by fighting the American featherweight Davey Moore, who\u2019s coming to Helsinki for the bout.  Advertisement But in the weeks prior to the big match, Olli finds himself strangely distracted. The movie opens with him driving his steadily dysfunctional little automobile to his girlfriend\u2019s place, only to learn that their date that night is to attend a wedding, for which he\u2019s not dressed. To top off the harriedness, his car breaks down for good. So Olli balances his sweet, pretty girlfriend Raija (Oona Airola) on the handlebars of a bicycle and off they go. The long, steady shot of the couple calmly gliding down the road has a lyricism that\u2019s the basis of the movie\u2019s rhythm.  Not all is placid for so long. Olli then makes his way for Helsinki, with Raija in tow. Manager Elis is putting them up in his place\u2014they have to sleep in the bunk beds that usually belong to his kids. The big money and accommodations of boxing have not yet come to Helsinki, it seems. Elis was once a boxer himself, and he\u2019s constantly trying to sell Olli on the glamour that accrues to a champion, swearing to his acolyte that the day Elli won a particular championship was \u201cthe happiest day of my life.\u201d  But Elis is not an ideal mentor. He has set up Olli in any number of sponsorship schemes, and is constantly insisting the socially ill-at-ease and na\u00efve boxer perform like a trained monkey at photo shoots and dinners. There\u2019s also the matter of weight, which Olli tries to explain to a friend in one of the movie\u2019s funniest scenes. Olli is most comfortable as a lightweight, but Elis, in order to get the bout with Moore, has ordered Olli to trim down to featherweight, which Olli is hard-pressed to do. Not least because of the epiphany that hits him like a thunderbolt during a press conference at which he can\u2019t stop looking at Raija smiling at him from the back of the room. He is truly in love, he decides then. And he makes the mistake of confiding to Elis about it.  Advertisement Resentment and backbiting ensue. Raija is compelled to take a train back to Kokkola, and Elis is revealed to be spending money on promoting the match far faster than he can accrue actual revenue from it, compelling HIS wife to kick him out of the house. A scene in which Elis has to beg a consortium of promoters for expense money as his kids wait in the car in a torrential downpour, and then one of said kids wanders into the building because he needs a bathroom, is one of the movie\u2019s most cringeworthy hilarious set pieces. It all builds up to the title event, a day that is the happiest not because of the outcome of the fight.  This movie won an award in the Un Certain Regard section of Cannes last year, and was also Finland\u2019s entry for consideration for a 2016 Academy Award. For all that, I should warn some readers that this is a movie that\u2019s laid back to what many would consider a fault. Its portrayal of Olli M\u00e4ki\u2019s ordinary-guyness risks making him ordinary to the point of invisibility. The movie doesn\u2019t hammer too hard on its ostensible theme that what one may be good at doesn\u2019t always define what one is. In this case, Olli is a reasonably skilled boxer whose temperament is antithetical to what one needs to be a great boxer. Which is not brutishness but single-mindedness. Lacking that single-mindedness with respect to boxing, Olli concludes that all he needs is love. A lesson for our time? I can only hope."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", "Review": "Whatever happened to the delight and, if you'll excuse the term, the magic in the \"Harry Potter\" series? As the characters grow up, the stories grow, too, leaving the innocence behind and confusing us with plots so labyrinthine that it takes a Ph.D from Hogwarts to figure them out. \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" still has much of the enchantment of the earlier films, but Harry no longer has as much joy. His face is lacking the gosh-wow-this-is-really-neat grin. He has internalized the secrets and delights of the world of wizards, and is now instinctively using them to save his life. Advertisement An early scene illustrates this change. Harry and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors, and in desperation he uses a secret spell to defeat them. But that earns the disapproval of his superiors at Hogwarts, and he is threatened with expulsion, because the spell is not to be used in public around Muggles. What is it, like a secret Masonic grip? When you're about to get your clock stopped by Dementors and you know the spell, what are you expected to do? Fall over passively and get Demented? There will come a time, I fear, as we approach the end of the series (one book and two films to go), that Harry and his friends will grow up and smell the coffee. They weren't trained as magicians for fun. When they eventually arrive at some apocalyptic crossroads, as I fear they will, can the series continue to live in PG-13 land? The archvillain Voldemort is shaping up as the star of nightmares. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has reason to fear that playtime is long behind. As a wizard chosen in childhood for his special powers, he has reason to believe Voldemort has returned and will have to be dealt with. The Ministry of Magic, like many a government agency, is hidebound in outdated convictions and considers Harry's warning to be heresy; at Hogwarts, a fierce new professor of the dark arts, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), has been installed to whip Harry into line. Her enemies include Harry's protector Dumbledore (Michael Gambon, looking as shabby as a homeless headmaster). Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) join Harry in fomenting resistance to Umbridge (sounds like \"umbrage\"), and soon they are mapping clandestine schemes to defend Dumbledore. Their plots, alas, seem more serious than the mischief Harry and friends would have thought up in earlier days. Yes, I know time passes, and the actors are eight years older than when they started filming. But if a kid starts watching \"Potter\" movies with this film, would he guess they used to be a little more whimsical? Advertisement By now, if we know anything at all about the \"Potter\" series, it's that nothing is as it seems, and the most unlikely characters have occult connections. Yes, but so many surprises have popped out of the hat that a veteran \"Potter\" watcher can almost, by a process of elimination, figure out who will surprise us next. For Harry, like many another leader before him, it is time to leave the nest and begin to work in the world. For the first time since we saw platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross, the city of London has a major role now, as Harry and sidekicks fly down the Thames and swoop past Big Ben. That causes me to wonder, what is the practical connection between the world of magic and the world of Muggles? Will Harry, or should Harry, become a world leader? Can wands and spells be of use in today's geopolitical turmoil? Or are Hogwarts grads living in a dimension of their own? All will be told, I guess, in the final book in J.K. Rowling's series, and then the retail book industry will be back on its own again. These things said, there is no denying that \"Order of the Phoenix\" is a well-crafted entry in the \"Potter\" series. The British have a way of keeping up production values in a series, even when the stories occasionally stumble. There have been lesser James Bond movies, but never a badly made one. And the necessary use of CGI here is justifiable, because what does magic create, anyway, other than real-life CGI without the computers? As for the cast, the \"Potter\" series has turned into a work-release program for great British actors mired in respectable roles. Staunton is perfect here as the Teacher From Hell. Helena Bonham Carter looks like the double for all three of Macbeth's witches. And then take a roll call: Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes (in the wings as Voldemort), Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, Warwick Davis, Julie Walters and the incomparable Maggie Smith. My hope, as we plow onward through \"Potters\" Nos. 6-7, is that the series will not grow darker still. Yet I suppose even at the beginning, with those cute little mail-owls, we knew the whimsy was too good to last. Now that Harry has experienced his first kiss, with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), we can only imagine what new opportunities lie ahead. Agent 009.75? Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Chronicle", "Review": "Man, you couldn't get me down into that hole in the ground for all the beans in Boston. It's perfectly circular, in the middle of a gloomy, grassy field, and Matt and Steve talk Andrew into bringing his new video camera and filming as they disappear into its dark maw. They use the camera's light and of course the screens of their iPhones. They can't see the bottom. It's spoiling hardly anything to tell you they find some sort of weird crystalline object. The letters UFO spring to mind. They stare at it and maybe it stares back. Then they discover they can move LEGO pieces using only their minds. This is called telekinesis. Matt looks it up in the dictionary. Advertisement From this deceptively ordinary beginning, John Trank's \"Chronicle\" grows into an uncommonly entertaining movie that involves elements of a superhero origin story, a science-fic\u00adtion fantasy and a drama about a disturbed teenager. Andrew (Dane DeHaan) is a shy and unpopular high school student with a dying mother and a mean-tempered drunk for a father. Matt (Alex Russell) is his cousin and only friend, a smart kid who quotes Plato as they descend into the hole. Steve (Michael B. Jordan) is cheerful, handsome and running for class president \u2014 all the things Andrew isn't. Whatever it is that happened to them in the hole gives them something overwhelming in common: They have new, challenging superpowers. Discovering this, they act like a bunch of kids. Hell, they are a bunch of kids, and the screenplay by Max Landis does a convincing job of making them realistic teenagers. This is a \"found footage\" movie like \"Blair Witch,\" allegedly shot on Andrew's camera. Then at a dance, Matt meets the friendly Casey (Ashley Hinshaw), who is making a video diary of her own life for her blog. With two cameras, \"Chronicle\" gets around the problem that with found footage you never see the character holding the camera. Later, we'll see other points of view: surveillance cameras, cell phone video and, toward the end, some sensational events on TV news. The movie is delightful for its first hour or so, and then turns dark and disturbing. The friends test their new powers and decide they're like muscles \u2014 you have to build them up slowly. This they do like mischievous teenagers. If you can lift a leaf blower at a distance, for example, you can use it to blow cheerleaders' skirts above their heads. You can put on an amazing magic show at school. For that matter, you can levitate the camera and get nice steadicam shots. Matt, the most responsible one, believes they should keep their powers secret. That will be impossible once Andrew begins to act out on the anti-social rage boiling inside himself. Advertisement Sometimes a movie arrives out of the blue that announces the arrival of considerable new talents. Josh Trank is 26, and this is his directing debut. Max Landis, also 26, has written a couple of shorts. His father is the director John Landis, but connections don't teach you how to write. Dane DeHaan, Michael B. Jordan and Alex Russell are in their early or mid-20s, have some experience and work together easily here as an ensemble. It's their convincing acting and Landis' dialogue \u2014 not just the late drama but the early goofing around \u2014 that gives the movie a natural authenticity. \"Chronicle\" seems at first to be all goofing around. It's Andrew's tortured personal life that steers it into deep currents, although they have fun getting there. They are teenagers who must think they'll live forever. Not only do they go down into that hole, but they discover they can fly up into thunderstorms.  Even if you could fly to 10,000 feet, would you want to? \"It's cold up here!\" one of them shouts. I forget which one. There was some lightning at the time."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Final Girls", "Review": "Dissertations have been written about the trope of The Final Girl. Stacie Ponder named her excellent blog after The Final Girl. What does The Final Girl(TM) say about our culture, and film, and female sexuality? To be fair, \"The Final Girls,\" directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson, with a script by Joshua John Miller and M.A. Fortin, does not set out to address those questions, except in the most surface-level way. It's more of an affectionate spoof on 1980's \"summer camp\" slasher films, spinning the familiar into a knowing world of \"meta\" commentary. It's similar to the \"X-Files\" episode \"Hollywood A.D.,\" when Scully and Mulder realize a movie is being made about their lives. A little of this goes a long way. Advertisement Max (played by Vera Farmiga's younger sister Taissa Farmiga) is a mousy high school student in mourning for her dead mother. Her mother (Malin Akerman) was once a Scream Queen whose definitive role was 20 years before in the \"classic\" \"Camp Bloodbath.\" \"Camp Bloodbath\" has gained such a cult following that its fans refer to themselves as \"Bathematicians.\" Max's mother played Amanda, the sweet blonde camp counselor \"with a clipboard and a guitar\" slashed to death after losing her virginity on a waterbed. Max has ambivalent feelings about \"Camp Bloodbath,\" so when she's invited to attend a screening of the movie in honor of her mother, she hesitates but then obliges, going with Chris (Alexander Ludwig), a handsome classmate who obviously has a crush on her. During the screening, through some convergence of audience/movie fandom and Max's yearning to see her mother again, Max and four of her pals are thrust into the fictional world of \"Camp Bloodbath.\" They stand in the woods, watching with confusion as the yellow VW van filled with raucous camp counselors careen down the road. Do the fictional characters know they're not real? Should the \"real\" characters warn the fictional characters that one by one they will be picked off by the machete-wielding burn victim Billy Murphy (Dan B. Norris)? The fictional Camp Bloodbath characters are played with broad yet well-observed specificity. There's Kurt (Adam DeVine), the sexist pig jock. There's Tina (played by Angela Trimbur), the \"slutty\" party girl. There's Blake (Tory N. Thompson), the black sidekick. Of course, there's sweet virgin Amanda. Finally, there's Paula (Chloe Bridges), the \"final girl,\" who enters smoking Marlboros and mentioning a \"bitchin' Firebird\" she wants to buy.\u00a0 Advertisement Max and her friends are also types. There's Vicki (Nina Dobrev), the mean girl, Gertie (Alia Shawkat), Max's vivacious freckled friend, Duncan (Thomas Middleditch), the nerdy \"Bathematician\" who knows the original movie by heart, and Chuck, the gorgeous nice guy.\u00a0These two groups end up being competing Breakfast Clubs (the true energy of the movie).\u00a0 The real\u00a0characters take on parental roles to the fictional characters, patiently explaining wireless phones and correcting Kurt when he uses the word \"fag.\" The real characters want to protect the fictional characters from harm, so they take control of the narrative (which continues to roll on regardless). Max finds herself bonding with the fictional character once played by her mother. Could it be more emotionally fraught?\u00a0 There are some innovative bits. The real characters end up going into the black-and-white flashback in the original \"Camp Bloodbath\" to witness Billy's origin story. \"Have I suddenly gone color-blind?\" gasps Gertie. (The words \"Summer 1957\" that start the flashback become actual three-dimensional objects that the characters have to step over.)\u00a0 \"The Final Girls\" is never once scary, the effects are schlocky, and the action/fight scenes are confusing, especially one that takes place in a dark shack where it is impossible to tell what is happening. Horror should be dark, yes. But so dark you can't see a thing? Many of the climactic moments are telegraphed from a mile away because horror movies are familiar. Will the black characters die first? Will the party girl be punished for her sexiness? Amanda's slow acceptance, through Max's gentle encouragement, that she doesn't need to be just the girl who loses her virginity and then dies, is pretty sentimental, but leavened with humorous moments when Amanda realizes that she, and the camp, are not real. \"What kind of camp has a waterbed anyway?\" she murmurs, as though it had never occurred to her before.\u00a0 The exploration of time-loops and fiction vs. real are somewhat funny but lacking the profundity of, say, \"Stranger Than Fiction\", \"Groundhog Day\" or \"Edge of\u00a0Tomorrow.\" The clearest example of the experimentation with time and narrative is Amanda's solemn monologue in \"Camp Bloodbath\" where she tells the other counselors \"the legend of Billy Murphy.\" That monologue is played a total of four times in \"The Final Girls,\" each one in a different context, until the \"re-enactment\" part of it, that it's all fiction anyway, is clear even to Amanda.\u00a0 Angela Trimbur, the actress who plays dumb promicuous Tina, almost walks away with the whole thing. It's a relatively small part, but she seems like she could have legitimately stepped out of a 1980s slasher film. Trimbur gives an extremely funny performance. Watch her in the background of group scenes. The comedy never stops. \"The Final Girls\" is a pretty disappointing experience if you are devoted to The Final Girl(TM), but it's not completely devoid of interest.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Sal", "Review": "James Franco's \"Sal,\" a film about the last day in the life of 1950s teen heartthrob Sal Mineo, was made in 2011, and it is only now getting a token release. This is Franco's fifth feature as a director, and in the two years since he shot it in nine days he has made four other features, two documentaries, and two shorts while continuing to act in movies and write short stories and put together art shows. In the fourth feature he directed, \"The Broken Tower,\" Franco cast himself as the great American poet Hart Crane and made a dreamy black-and-white hash of Crane's life, filled with student film visuals and dorm-room philosophizing. It was a disgraceful movie, disconnected from any but the most superficial understanding of Crane's work and life, and Franco has only somewhat better luck with \"Sal,\" a film about a likable but minor actor and icon.  Advertisement \"Sal\" opens with actual news footage of Mineo's 1976 murder, which is followed by a lengthy sequence in which Mineo (Val Lauren) strenuously works out. This is followed by a long lunch conversation between Mineo and a man he wants to produce a movie he is angling to direct. It becomes clear in this scene that Franco is going for realism, but what winds up on screen are formless conversations that don't sound much like people talking but do sound like unprepared actors just winging it and trying their best. Lauren looks and sounds enough like Mineo to be acceptable in the role, but the film gives him very little to do and very little to play. \"Sal\" would be a bad movie if it shoehorned in exposition on Mineo into this last day of his life, but by keeping almost all exposition at bay Franco makes a film as morbid as Gus Van Sant's \"Last Days,\" where all we do is wait through uneventful hours with the protagonist until their foreordained death comes as a kind of finale and release.   We see Lauren's Mineo talking on the phone a lot, trying to get people to come and see a play he's rehearsing, \"P.S. Your Cat Is Dead!\" He complains about his co-star Keir Dullea (Jim Parrack) and says, \"Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow,\" a No\u00ebl Coward quip that is not credited to Coward. Is Mineo supposed to be just passing it off as his own joke? Toward the end of the film, after we have seen a long rehearsal of the play, Mineo actually makes this joke to Dullea's face, but he gets no response. Certainly the rehearsal of the play is more interesting than all the scenes where we watch Sal drive, or Sal go to the doctor, or Sal talk to his actress friend Jill Haworth on the phone, but \"P.S. Your Cat Is Dead!\" looks so awful that any \"Mineo could have been a contender\" vibe gets shut down.  Mineo was gay, and fairly open about that fact. He had played maybe the first gay teenager in an American movie, Plato in Nicholas Ray's \"Rebel Without a Cause,\" and Plato needs to be killed off in that film because he is seen as too different and too disturbed to survive. Mineo, on the other hand, was stabbed to death because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film ends with footage of his corpse on the sidewalk, and then a scene from \"Rebel.\" From the first footage of the newscast on Mineo's death to this last tasteless film of his body lying in the street, nothing much has been learned about Mineo.  Advertisement Franco gave probably his best performance in the TV movie \"James Dean,\" and so maybe that's why he wanted to do a film about Dean's \"Rebel\" co-star Mineo, but that isn't enough of a reason to make a movie. Who was this film made for? Particularly hardcore Sal Mineo fans? For all his activity, Franco is still an amateur filmmaker, a hobbyist who vacuums up gay culture for no clear reason or purpose. The most that can be said for \"Sal\" is that at least Franco's small sensibility fits the smallness of his subject, whereas he should know enough by now to leave literary giants like Hart Crane and William Faulkner alone (his film of Faulkner's \"As I Lay Dying\" is also getting a token release this year). If Franco could be made to understand that just because you can do something doesn't mean you should do it maybe we could stop or at least stem the tide of his arbitrary projects like \"Sal.\""}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Life of Crime", "Review": "The late great Elmore Leonard, on whose novel \u201cThe Switch\u201d\r\nthis movie is based, gets an executive producer credit on the movie. It\u2019s\r\nsignificant, perhaps, that said credit doesn\u2019t appear until after the movie\u2019s\r\nplayed out. Shows a certain confidence on the part of the other filmmakers:\r\nthey didn\u2019t feel the need to stack the deck with an emblem of Leonard\u2019s\r\napproval at the film\u2019s onset. It turns out, the confidence was warranted: \u201cLife\r\nof Crime\u201d is a pretty engaging, and pretty authentically Leonardesque, comedic\r\ncrime movie. While it doesn\u2019t hit the highs of the very best movies based on\r\nthe author\u2019s works\u2014those would be Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cOut of Sight\u201d and\r\nQuentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cJackie Brown,\u201d two outstanding examples of American\r\nnarrative cinema of the \u201890s\u2014it\u2019s also far less slick and ingratiating than the\r\nwatchable but very Hollywood-processed likes of \u201cGet Shorty\u201d and \u201cBe Cool.\u201d  Advertisement The assets of \u201cLife Of Crime\u201d include a relatively credible\r\n1978 Detroit setting, a generous array of seamy characters with seamy\r\naspirations (and interesting ways of talking), and a pretty first-rate cast\r\nplaying those characters. John Hawkes and the performer usually known as Mos\r\nDef, here going by the name Yasiin Bey (no, I don\u2019t know why) are the criminals\r\nLouis and Ordell, and yes, these are the same characters who turn up in \u201cRum\r\nPunch,\u201d which was the novel on which \u201cJackie Brown\u201d is based. For the purposes\r\nof this story, both of these bad guys are a little less\u2026awful than they are in\r\nTarantino\u2019s film. Point of fact, they\u2019re kind of likable, especially Louis.\r\nHe\u2019s first seen being talked into a kidnapping scheme by Bey\u2019s Ordell, who\r\nsubsequently proves his get-the-criminal-job-done bonafides by facing down an\r\nobstreperous pimp. Ordell\u2019s scheme is to kidnap the wife of a corrupt local\r\nbusinessman, and demand as ransom the money he\u2019s been secretly stashing down in\r\na tax-shelter bank in the Bahamas. There are already a lot of holes in this\r\nscheme to begin with\u2014Leonard\u2019s crooks are rarely the brightest bulbs on the\r\nChristmas tree\u2014but the biggest comes to light after the pair kidnap the\r\ndisillusioned wife, Mickey, and stash her in the home of an accomplice who\u2019s a\r\nNazi gun nut. That is, Mickey\u2019s husband, stiff-necked drunkard and all-around\r\nunpleasant fellow Frank, isn\u2019t all that interested in getting his wife back.\r\nAnd he\u2019s also got a little girlfriend at his Caribbean love nest, and she sees\r\nan opportunity in Mickey\u2019s misfortune.  Before I got off on the plot synopsis I was praising the\r\ncast, and of course Hawkes and to a lesser degree the artist formerly known as\r\nMos Def are reliable screen goods. As are Tim Robbins as Frank (a role\r\nthat would have looked tailor-made for Christopher MacDonald 20 years ago),\r\nIsla Fisher as Frank\u2019s, um, little chippie, Mark Boone Junior as the Nazi gun\r\nnut, and Will Forte as a social peer of the unhappy couple who\u2019s got a weird thing\r\nfor Mickey. The big surprise here is Aniston, who gives one of her best if not\r\nbest ever movie performances here. Although she\u2019s the female lead, she really lets\r\nherself melt into the ensemble, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the part or if she\u2019s\r\nreally upped her acting game, but her performance is measured, engrossing, and\r\nempathy-generating without any overt\r\nstriving, cutesy stuff, or sitcom-style tics. She actually develops quite a\r\nrapport with Hawkes, not a fellow you expect her to mix with either in\r\ncharacter or not.

{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "We Come as Friends", "Review": "Feel-bad docu-essay \"We Come As Friends\" is a deliberately vague portrait of Sudan as a country beset by self-interested neocolonialist outsiders. Fitfully narrated by director Hubert Sauper (\"Darwin's Nightmare\"), \"We Come As Friends\" adopts an apolitical, and largely anecdotal approach to its presentation of Sudan and its inhabitants. Interview subjects are almost never introduced by name since Sauper's footage is meant to be accepted on an implicit, symbolic level. This approach is infuriating since it constantly asks viewers to understand scenes in a general way. Viewers are not privileged with a more thoughtful, specific view of the institutionalized problems that Sudanese natives face because Sauper's not interested in making that kind of film. Instead, he provokes viewers by juxtaposing quasi-archetypal stories and loaded footage that are, as they're arranged in the film, only as meaningful as you want them to be. Advertisement \"We Come As Friends\" begins and ends with an unidentified speaker rhetorically asking \"Did you know that the moon belongs to the white man?\" That pseudo-naive question makes a little more sense at the beginning of Sauper's film since it is the punchline to a story about the voracious nature of white countries who, during the Space Race, were vain enough to try to claim outer space for their respective countries. Sauper repeatedly sympathizes with this kind of mythical revisionist history by over-extending, though never cogently developing, its logic.\u00a0 We are told that in Sudan, rich foreigners assimilate everything. People sing songs about and in the voice of French, British, American, and Chinese celebrities, politicians and philanthropists. Religion is perceived in binary form: there are only Christians and Muslims, and nary a Jew, Sikh, Buddhist, atheist, or anything else in between. Children are punished if they do not wear Western uniforms. They are taught to sing about the value of \"cooperating and development.\" And outsiders are called \"aliens,\" as in the scene where Sauper asks a trio of indifferent Chinese engineers \"which planet did you come from.\" One engineer shoots back a blank stare that speaks volumes, but doesn't necessarily confirm Sauper's simplistic adopted perspective.\u00a0 At this point, I must point out that I am sympathetic to the pessimistic but pragmatic ideas that are forcefully presented throughout \"We Come As Friends.\" I also think that Sauper's presentation demands a critical response. Viewers\u2014even ones who are part of the choir Sauper is preaching to\u2014should not trust \"We Come As Friends\" because it constantly expects its audience to understand conflicts and interview segments without any contextualizing information. What does it matter if one engineer tells viewers to \"be careful of cultural differences\" while a clip from \"Star Wars: A New Hope\" plays on a laptop right next to Sauper's subject? This clip means nothing beyond its implicit, over-burdened message. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Late Bloomers", "Review": "\"I'm getting old. And you're getting old, too.\" Mary looks her husband in the eyes and says out loud something they both know, but which only she is willing to deal with. Isabella Rossellini and William Hurt star in \"Late Bloomers,\" an uneven but touching comedy with a cheery score that sounds too much like whistling on the way past the graveyard. Without even trying to be profound, the film communicates a great deal of truth. Perhaps it seems particularly true to me, because Rossellini and I both have our birthdays coming up on the 18th of this month. If she's old, I'm 10 years older. Advertisement Adam (Hurt) is an architect working in London. Mary (Rossellini), his wife, was born in Italy. They've been married for 30 years. The film opens with her undergoing a medical examination, which returns good news, but something like that can help you imagine the bells tolling. We see Mary taking exercise classes in a local swimming pool and looking for more to do with her time; her friend Charlotte (Joanna Lumley) suggests the old standby, volunteer work. Adam has just received the sort of award that comes near the end of a career and is incapable of thinking of his career in such a way. They seem happy enough, although the actors are useful in suggesting their differences: Rossellini glows and has a warm smile as usual, and Hurt is detached and has his angular look as usual. Their three grown children sense something is shifting in the marriage. Adam's firm was founded to take unpopular assignments and find exciting solutions for them. Now he's asked to design a senior retirement home, the last thing he could have wished for. Charlotte lines up Mary for volunteer work at a foundation where the woman in charge is unbearably condescending to a room full of her older volunteers. Although Mary was a teacher of advanced Italian, this horrible woman asks her to bake cakes. Mary begins to improve their home with gadgets: a telephone with enlarged numbers, grab bars above the bathtub and lift-off bars on either side of the toilet. You never know when you might need such things. Adam is offended. At work, he skulks over the old-age home assignment until some young colleagues express their admiration for him, and then he makes them a secret task force to work on the project with him. Part of his renewed interest may involve a warm-eyed young woman (Arta Dobroshi), who considers him a hero. Communication between Mary and Adam begins to shut down. Advertisement \"Late Bloomers,\" directed by Julie Gavras, doesn't use fraught scenes and heated dialogue to reflect their troubles. They aren't those kind of people, and this isn't that kind of film. It offers shallow pleasures and the satisfaction of seeing two actors in performances better than the film deserves. They're surrounded by easy supporting turns: Simon Callow as Adam's boss, Doreen Mantle as Mary's mother, and their three children are the dry and stuffy James (Aidan McArdle); the sweet Giulia (Kate Ashfield), and the feckless Benjamin (Luke Treadaway). Not much communication between the generations, either. If \"Late Boomers\" offers good acting and useful truths, it also offers some condescension of its own. There's one of those familiar but unbelievable movie scenes where a man opens his door and about 15 complete strangers sweep past him without a word, followed by his wife with a smug smile. They're all old people and should have better manners."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Company Men", "Review": "The happiest people I come into contact with seem to be those who have real jobs. In the last few weeks, I've talked with a Mac\u00adintosh tutor, a doctor, a set designer, a stagehand, a heating and air-conditioning man, a lawyer, a Web designer, my editor, an animator and Millie Salmon, the woman who is my caregiver, although that job description makes me sound more decrepit than I am. All of these people work hard, know what they're doing, think it's worth doing, enjoy it and take pride in it. There is the same serenity I sensed from my father, who was an electrician and a damned good one. I do not, however, pick up good feelings from those people I know who are largely involved in \u201cmaking money for the stockholders.\" They focus on moving money around, hiring and firing, cutting costs, serving the bottom line. They are caregivers for corporations, which would be more satisfactory if corporations were not essentially balance sheets. I know the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations are individuals, but when did one ever tell you a good joke? Advertisement \u201cThe Company Men\" follows the stories of characters who have oriented their lives around a corporation once named General Transportation Systems. Years ago, this company involved two men who began building ships; small ones at first, and then big ones. Now it's called GTX, which is how we spell Acme these days. Caught in the economic downturn, GTX is downsizing, and some of its employees are discovering their primary occupation was making and spending a lot of money, and that without those jobs, there isn't much they really know how to do. We focus at first on Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck), who drives a Porsche and has a nice golf handicap, a big suburban house and a wife named Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt), who is an expert consumer. Bobby loses his job. His severance and \u201csavings cushion\" can't support his overhead. He enters, with great displeasure, the shadow world of the unemployed. His company has paid for temporary office space at a job search center that helps him with his resume. He attends group therapy sessions where he learns how to present himself and think positively. He loathes them. Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), an older man at GTX, is also fired. If there is no great demand for Bobby, there is none for an unemployed executive around 60. He was literally his job. Without it, in economic terms, he is a man with no buyers and nothing to sell. He was under the impression he had importance and value. He realizes that was a fiction. Employees of corporations are like free-ranging scavenger cells. When the corporation inhales in good times, they find themselves in a warm place with good nurture. When it exhales in bad times, they go spinning into the vast, indifferent world. Advertisement GTX was started by Salinger (Craig T. Nelson) and McClary (Tommy Lee Jones). McClary preserves the belief that a corporation owes its employees some loyalty, and that it should serve a useful function. Salinger has outgrown that phase and realizes a corporation survives only by maximizing its profits and producing one primary product: income. As Salinger's vision prevails over McClary's old-fashioned idealism, the inexorable task of \u201cworking for the shareholder\" is reduced to \u201csacrificing the jobs and lives of others for the bottom line.\" Although the actors are convincing and the film well-crafted, \u201cThe Company Men\" delivers few satisfactory character portraits because the movie isn't really about characters, it's about economic units. When a corporation fires you, it doesn't much care whether you're a good friend, a loving father, a louse or a liar. You are an investment it carries on its books, or not. The movie's impact comes when these people realize it doesn't matter in economic terms who they are. There's one character who really does something. This is Jack Dolan (Kevin Costner), Bobby's brother-in-law, who owns a small construction company that builds one house at a time. He and his workers know how to make house siding lie true, how to use materials efficiently, how to \u2014 well, how to drive a nail. Bobby has always dismissed Jack as a \u201cworking man,\" but when you're out of work that looks pretty good. Written and directed by John Wells, \u201cThe Company Men\" offers no great elation or despair. Its world is what it is. We all live in it. In good times, young people go to the movies and dream of becoming Gordon Gekko. In bad times, a house builder looks more like a Master of the Universe. It happens I've been talking with a few young people who are trying to make career decisions. My advice involves the old cliche, \u201cFind what you really love doing and make that your profession.\" I think this is true. If you have to be unemployed, it might seem less bleak if you hated doing the job, anyway. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Very Semi-Serious", "Review": "Few people were greater fans of The New Yorker cartoon caption contest than Roger Ebert. Out of an approximate 200 submissions, one received first place, though several more have been published online, both by Ebert and New Yorker cartoon editor\u00a0Bob Mankoff. After Ebert\u2019s death in 2013, Mankoff listed some of the funniest entries made by the late critic, and noted that the last one\u2014written a week prior to his passing\u2014was for the image of a chef lying in a coffin. Though Mankoff admitted that it didn\u2019t rank among Ebert\u2019s best captions, he imagined the critic would have quipped, \u201cHey, give me a break. Dying is easy, comedy is hard.\u201d Advertisement It\u2019s easy to see why people like Ebert would be so taken with the droll charm of New Yorker cartoons, which essentially serve as cultural criticism. They can accentuate the absurdities of everyday life with sketches that are at once spare and expressive, silly and sophisticated. There\u2019s no doubt that most critics who watch Leah Wolchok\u2019s playful documentary, \u201cVery Semi-Serious,\u201d will find the array of cartoonists interviewed eminently relatable, in part because their cherished work will never pay the bills, thus rendering day jobs a necessity. There\u2019s a particularly poignant cartoon where a boss matter-of-factly informs his employee that, \u201cWe have a new financial model where you don\u2019t get paid anything.\u201d Catnip for writers and humorists of all stripes, Wolchok\u2019s film provides delightful breakdowns of various cartoons, examining the comedic rhythm of their design and detail. Occasionally the camera will pan down an elaborate drawing before lingering on a succinct caption of deadpan understatement. Unlike \u201cWordplay,\u201d Patrick Creadon\u2019s 2006 profile of New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz, \u201cVery Semi-Serious\u201d is not limited to the story of one man and his many admirers. At a brisk 83 minutes, the film does live up to its tongue-in-cheek subtitle promising \u201ca partially thorough portrait of New Yorker cartoonists,\u201d though Wolchok does an admirable job of providing amble screen time for numerous artists\u2014both veteran and aspiring\u2014while enabling us to survey their distinctive styles (the most iconic of which belongs to Gothic satirist Charles Addams).\u00a0 Part of the New Yorker cartoons\u2019 appeal lies in their timelessness. It\u2019s startling to observe how a cartoon from the publication\u2019s inaugural year of 1925\u2014juxtaposing an ape hanging from a branch and a commuter clutching the handle of a subway train, accompanied by the caption, \u201c700,000 years of progress\u201d\u2014could\u2019ve been dreamed up yesterday. Mankoff refers to one new cartoonist, Ed Steed, as a genius in how he creates imagery that could\u2019ve resonated in any era. Oftentimes his drawings don\u2019t require a caption in order to elicit a laugh. The same cannot be said of Liana Finck, another fresh-faced, soft-spoken talent whose submissions rely heavily on her own handwritten captions. Though she has difficulty in getting her work published, one hopes to see much more of it in The New Yorker, since it\u2019s among the funniest featured in the film. I especially love her sample sketch entitled, \u201cThe Wisdom of Used Tissues,\u201d in which crumbled kleenexes lie on the ground, wistfully musing, \u201cAt least we\u2019ll have our memories.\u201d Advertisement At the center of the film, of course, is Mankoff, who resembles a grayer yet cheerier Joel Coen, and is credited with keeping his department relevant after taking over as cartoon editor in 1997. It was his idea to make the cartoons intergenerational by giving young people the chance to contribute their work, which tends to be inspired more by \u201cRen and Stimpy\u201d than \u201cGoofus and Gallant\u201d (Mankoff asks one artist to dial back on the seemingly crack-fueled expressions of his characters). The emergence of female voices has also been key in subverting the publication\u2019s predominantly male gaze. In an excerpt of archival footage, the head of twentysomething cartoonist Roz Chast is seen bobbing its way through a sea of men at a staff party, an indelible image worthy of its own caption. Chast has since become one of The New Yorker\u2019s most prolific cartoonists, with taboo-busting peers like Emily Flake following in her footsteps. Flake considers the bullying and alienation she endured in her youth not only preparation for her career as a cartoonist, but a pre-requisite.\u00a0 Nothing provides better fodder for comedy than the unescapable seriousness of life. Though no cartoons ran in the issue following the 2001 terror attacks, the second post-9/11 issue featured a classic sketch by Leo Cullum, in which a badly dressed man is told by a jovial woman, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d laugh again, but then I saw your shirt.\u201d Aside from minor slip-ups, such as two similar cartoons running back-to-back, there are no scandals to speak of in the cartoon department\u2019s history, at least according to the documentary. No mention is made of Charlie Hebdo, though viewers will likely speculate about whether the free speech championed by publications like The New Yorker\u00a0will be compromised by the threat of terrorism. My guess is that it won\u2019t at all, considering editor David Remnick\u2019s response to a colleague cautioning that a cartoon parodying The Last Supper will receive hate mail: \u201cWho cares?\u201d Though the subjects remain acutely aware of Wolchok\u2019s camera throughout, there is one instance of unguarded emotion where Mankoff and his wife recall the recent death of their son. Tears begin to flow as they explain that their recent change of houses was motivated by their need to escape painful memories that existed in every signifier of the past. For nearly a century, The New Yorker cartoons have provided readers with the sort of visual diversions that have made it possible for life to continue to be lived, even in the wake of unthinkable despair. We seek solace in them, and so do their creators. In one classic cartoon, a man is guided out of his bedroom by the Grim Reaper, while his wife calmly replies, \u201cThink of it as one less thing to worry about.\u201d Death will eventually guide us all out the door, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have the last laugh.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Rememory", "Review": "Any description of \"Rememory\" is bound to make it sound\u00a0more inviting than it is. I was, admittedly, drawn in by the story's high-concept\u00a0premise: Gordon Dunn (Martin Donovan),\u00a0the inventor\u00a0of a cutting-edge, memory-extracting machine, is found dead, and it's up to mysterious friend Sam Bloom (Peter Dinklage) to solve the case. Gordon's device is intriguing because it gives us a supposedly objective window into any user's past. When you see the\u00a0past\u00a0through\u00a0this invention, you're supposedly\u00a0watching events\u00a0replay without the impediments of\u00a0personal bias, or natural forgetfulness.\u00a0 Advertisement Better yet: as you watch footage recorded directly from users' brains, you\u00a0assume the\u00a0position of the person revisiting their past.\u00a0The camera shows us\u00a0what users observed\u00a0in\u00a0the past during major life events, like\u00a0birthday parties, breathtaking trips to exotic locations, moments of physical intimacy\u00a0with loved ones, or even\u00a0screaming matches with those same loved ones. Unfortunately,\u00a0co-writer/director Mark Palansky doesn't do enough with this fantastic main\u00a0conceit. There is nothing vicariously joyful\u00a0about Sam's process of discovery, nor any memorably provocative moments of\u00a0reflection from Gordon's patients, almost all of whom regret\u00a0having gotten involved\u00a0with him, and his futuristic memory. Instead, we watch as Sam drifts\u00a0from one encounter to the next without\u00a0making a lasting impression. It's a maddening experience, watching a film with\u00a0a great\u00a0kernel of an idea fail to grow\u00a0into something equally impressive. We start from the premise that Sam Bloom is, like so many amateur detectives, a stranger observing a gallery of loosely-connected\u00a0outsiders. Gordon's death has not been officially called a homicide, but that doesn't matter to Sam. He knows that any blemish on\u00a0Gordon's legacy could negatively affect his company\u00a0Cortex,\u00a0represented in the film by selfish bureaucrat\u00a0Lawton (\"Lost\" star Henry Ian Cusick),\u00a0and nervous flunky Neil Frankel (Chad Krowchuk). So, Sam starts his own independent search for answers, starting with an impromptu meeting with Gordon's widow Carolyn (Julia Ormond). During this casual conversation, Sam steals Gordon's memory-transcribing prototype, and proceeds to track down Gordon's patients. During this process, Sam lies to suspects and their family members about his own identity. He assumes false names, and is evasive about his personal connection to Gordon. But viewers know, thanks to an early conversation with Carolyn, that Sam and Gordon met by chance during a thunderstorm at a hotel bar, and made a deep connection after much imbibing. Sam and Gordon's bond is largely represented through Dinklage's impassioned line delivery, and his character's recollection of his eventful evening with Gordon.\u00a0Palansky also shows us a snippet from Sam's memory of Gordon,\u00a0laughing and smiling beatifically as he's pelted with enough rain to give\u00a0the healthiest male athlete a crippling case of pneumonia. Sam's memory looks like a film school student's approximation\u00a0of\u00a0a post-\"Tree of Life\" Terrence Malick flashback, only it's been\u00a0lensed by\u00a0one of the featured photographers in\u00a0those eye-roll-inducing\u00a0\"Shot on iPhone\"\u00a0advertisements.\u00a0So while this scene should be dazzling and tantalizing,\u00a0it's unconvincing and banal. Advertisement The limitations of Palansky and co-writer Mike Vukadinovich's shared\u00a0vision are, realistically, the biggest problem with \"Rememory.\" They\u00a0don't spend enough time examining the fundamental disconnect between the way characters\u00a0see themselves, and their true,\u00a0\"objective\" nature, whatever that might be. Maybe the deciding moments\u00a0in\u00a0characters' lives play out exactly as they are\u00a0remembered. Or, more likely, maybe people don't recognize the people they once were. I couldn't tell based on\u00a0chopped-up, over-prettified flashback fragments\u00a0because these characters are valuable\u00a0to Sam as suspects.\u00a0They stop mattering to\u00a0him after he's sifted through their backstories, and determined if they were\u00a0a threat to Gordon.\u00a0So we don't\u00a0learn anything substantial when, by\u00a0film's end,\u00a0Sam\u00a0has a breakthrough, and realizes that all he was looking for was \"focus\" and \"resolution,\" and not clarity, or closure. There's a difference between these two sets of values, but you couldn't tell based on \"Rememory.\" Palansky and Vukadinovich never accomplish what the makers of other superior\u00a0films, like \"Defending Your Life,\" \"After Life,\" or even \"Human Nature,\" previously did by forcing their characters to\u00a0reconsider the impact they've had on others' lives. I really\u00a0wanted to like \"Rememory,\" if only because I\u00a0normally\u00a0enjoy the work of\u00a0its talented cast members, especially Dinklage, and the late Anton Yelchin, the latter of whom has a negligible, minutes-long walk-on part. But to enjoy \"Rememory,\" you have to care about\u00a0Palansky and Vukadinovich's\u00a0plot as a character-revealing mechanism. \"Rememory\" never works\u00a0as a procedural, so it's\u00a0an\u00a0unsurprisingly lifeless\u00a0piece of science-fiction."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Ratatouille", "Review": "A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably \"Shrek,\" but Brad Bird's \"Ratatouille\" is the first one that made me positively desire one. Remy, the earnest little rat who is its hero, is such a lovable, determined, gifted rodent that I want to know happens to him next, now that he has conquered the summit of French cuisine. I think running for office might not be beyond his reach, and there's certainly something de Gaullean about his snout. Remy is a member of a large family of rats (a horde, I think, is the word) who ply the trash cans and sewers of a Parisian suburb, just like good rats should. \"Eat your garbage!\" commands Remy's father, Django, obviously a loving parent. The rats are evicted from their cozy home in a cottage-kitchen ceiling in a scene that will have rat-haters in the audience cringing (and who among us will claim they don't hate rats more than a little?), and they are swept through the sewers in a torrential flood. Students of Victor Hugo will know that the hero Jean Valjean of Les Miserables found the Seine because he knew that every sewer must necessarily run downhill toward it, and indeed Remy washes up near the river, in view of the most famous restaurant in tout le France. This is the establishment of Auguste Gusteau, author of the best-seller Anyone Can Cook, a title that might not go over very well in France, which is why the book appears to be in English, and might well be titled, Anyone Can Cook Better Than the English. (Famous British recipe: \"Cook until gray.\") Advertisement Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) has always been blessed, or cursed, with a refined palate and a sensitive nose, and now he starts skulking around the kitchen of Gusteau, his culinary hero (voice of Brad Garrett). Alas, when the monstrous food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) issues a scathing indictment of Gusteau's recent cooking, the chef dies in a paroxysm of grief or perhaps it is not a paroxysm, but I like the word, and the kitchen is taken over by the sniveling little snipe Skinner (Ian Holm). Lowest of the low is Gusteau's \"nephew\" Linguini (Lou Romano), who must be hired, but is assigned to the wretched job of plongeur -- literally, one who washes the dishes by plunging them into soapy water. Linguini and Remy meet, somehow establish trust and communication, and when Linguini gets credit for a soup that the rat has saved with strategic seasonings, they team up. Remy burrows into Linguini's hair, is concealed by his toque, can see through its transparent sides and controls Linguini by pulling on his hair as if each tuft were a joystick. Together, they astonish Paris with their genius. All of this begins as a dubious premise and ends as a triumph of animation, comedy, imagination and, yes, humanity. What is most lovable about Remy is his modesty and shyness, even for a rat. He has body language so expressive than many humans would trade for it. Many animated characters seem to communicate with semaphores, but Remy has a repertory of tiny French hand gestures, shrugs and physical expressiveness. Does any other nationality have more ways of moving a finger and an eyebrow less than an inch while signaling something as complex as, \"I would do anything for you, monsieur, but as you see, I have only two hands, and these times we live in do not permit me the luxury of fulfilling such requests.\" Brad Bird and his executive producer, John Lasseter, clearly have taken over the leadership in the animation field right now. Yes, Bird made \"The Incredibles,\" but the one that got away was his wonderful \"The Iron Giant,\" in which a towering robot was as subtle, gentle and touching as Remy. His eye for detail is remarkable. Every prop and utensil and spice and ingredient in the kitchen is almost tangible, and I for one would never turn off the Food Channel if Remy hosted a program named \"Any Rat Can Cook.\" This is clearly one of the best of the year's films. Every time an animated film is successful, you have to read all over again about how animation isn't \"just for children\" but \"for the whole family,\" and \"even for adults going on their own.\" No kidding!

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Like Father, Like Son", "Review": "Too soon! Comma or not, the English-language title of Japanese writer/director Hirokazu Kore-eda often wrenching new family drama (winner of the Jury Prize at last year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival) bears too distinct a resemblance to the name of 1987\u2019s universally beloved Dudley Moore/Kirk Cameron starter. What\u2019s next, Japan? A movie whose title translates into \"Gone, With The Wind?\" Okay, that\u2019s enough out of me. But in all seriousness, the not inapt but too on-the-nose English language title of \"Soshite chichi ni naru\" (which, Google Translate tells me, works out to something like \"And I Will Be His Father\") is the worst thing about this movie. Kore-eda, whose pictures don\u2019t exactly alternate between soulful, understated fantastic fables (\"Afterlife,\" \"Air Doll\") and quiet family dramas (\"Still Walking\"), brings his trademark delicate but deliberate eye (and ear) to a really heartbreaking scenario. Six years into raising their only child Keita, whose birth left the young mother unable to have any more children, young couple Ryota and Midori are told that the child is not, in fact, theirs at all: that a hospital error switched two baby boys at birth. Soon the couple are meeting their biological child for the first time, along with the family that raised him.  Advertisement As would not be unexpected in a domestic melodrama, the two families could not be more different. While Ryota (Masaharu Fukuyama) is a cold-to-icy ambitious salaryman, next to whom Midori (Machiko Ono) sometimes looks resentfully dutiful, their biological son, named Ryusei, has been growing up with two young siblings, in a cozy raucous household whose tinkerer dad Yudai (Lily Franky) and ramen-restaurant-server mom Yukari (Yoko Maki) dote on their kids despite their limited means.  Initially the clash of classes seems a little schematic. The straightforward Yudai sees a big payoff from the hospital, while Ryota adopts an arguably fake-noble stance with his insistence that the money doesn\u2019t matter, that they have to come up with a plan for what\u2019s best for the kids. Obviously a swap has to be made, eventually. But is that conclusion really so obvious? In a series of beautifully calibrated scenes, Kore-eda explores not just the nature of parental love but of filial love, and as the painful alienated past of Ryota comes to light, his stiffness and lack of empathy become more comprehensible but no less kind of infuriating. It\u2019s a testimony to Fukuyama\u2019s acting skills that as pig-headedly alienating as the character can be, he never becomes a complete turn-off. That\u2019s also a testimony to the way Kore-eda presents the situation; while the perspective is never not clear-headed, the abject heartbreak of the scenario is ever present. (Imagine the way that a typical Hollywood film about this story would make a deliberate burlesque of it.) A second act plot twist of sorts doesn\u2019t just accelerate the dramatic momentum; it forces the characters to confront the uglier sides of themselves. Every now and then, Kore-eda will overplay his representations a little bit; there\u2019s a scene in which Ono\u2019s character contemplates an escape from the torment of potentially trading the son she loves for a child she doesn\u2019t know, biology or not; this takes place on a train, and as her thoughts grow darker, the shadows of the station that the train is pulling into throw her and the child actor into literal darkness. It\u2019s a well-orchestrated effect that hinges on obvious. On the other hand, I suspect the only reason it stands out is because most of the movie is so subtle and straightforward. While I\u2019m not a parent myself, I can see how \"Like Father, Like Son\" would be a tough sit for any parent. Tough, but extremely worthwhile."}

Yet you feel as if you\u2019re being trolled by the film, because it puts the completely-coated Saldana in a shower, a swimming pool and against Clorox bleach-bright white sheets that are just itching to become smudged. Genuine suspense is created by the possible exposure of Saldana\u2019s original shade, but like actual Blackness, the color stays on without incident. You\u2019ll see some durable makeup in \u201cNina.\" What you won\u2019t see is any justification why this film should exist. Advertisement \u201cNina\u201d is completely clueless about what made\u00a0Nina\u00a0Simone great. Her music is butchered by Saldana, who sings the songs herself in an ever-escalating series of terrible numbers. Simone\u2019s dark skin color and distinctly African-American features, proud badges of honor that were often problematic in society, are unrealistically recreated rather than realistically cast. Her career-long activism for her people is reduced to a few throwaway lines; never once do we feel how this struggle affected her. This is a film that not only doesn\u2019t give us \u201cMississippi Goddam,\" it can\u2019t even say the full name of the song. The lack of the incendiary \u201cgoddam\u201d in dialogue about the song is a symbolic representation of how this film neuters and whitewashes its subject. \u201cNina\u201d chronicles an unstable, older Simone, which means that, in addition to colorizing Saldana, she\u2019s also aged several years. No one considered reworking the screenplay to focus on a\u00a0Nina\u00a0Simone closer to Saldana\u2019s actual age. This is because the film would have to get its hands dirty\u2014the thirty-something\u00a0Nina\u00a0Simone was deeply entrenched within the Civil Rights Movement, singing angry songs and clearly harshing a mellow that the filmmakers do not wish to disturb. Doing so would require a character who was less of a victim than writer/director Cynthia Mort\u2019s script wants to portray. One gets the feeling that Mort wants to play the hero here, saving that \"poor Negro singer\" she\u2019s a casual fan of rather than letting her have any agency. So \u201cNina\u201d becomes a story about the real life Clifton Henderson (David Oyelowo), the nurse who was, according to this film, Simone\u2019s manager, savior and the catalyst for her \u201ctriumphant return to the stage.\" He\u2019s presented with hot mess\u00a0Nina\u00a0Simone, whose extreme drinking and refusal to take her bipolar depression pills have led her to be temporarily institutionalized. Henderson isn\u2019t a fan\u2014he barely knows her music\u2014yet he inexplicably decides to drop everything and fly to France to be her caretaker. There, he is privy to numerous violent and emotional outbursts by Simone, which occur in almost sitcom-like fashion. None of these dramatic scenes are credibly performed by Saldana, who gives the worst performance of her career. At one point, she just stands and stares angrily into the distance, as if awaiting direction from her first-time director. Oyelowo spends the entire movie looking confused, which is perfect because he\u2019s the stand-in for the equally confused audience. Advertisement We\u2019re never clued in about Henderson\u2019s homosexuality, because the film wants to play coy with his relationship with Simone. When her graphic sexual advances are rebuffed, Simone calls him a gay slur, but the film repeatedly implies that something may happen between them. She sings \u201cI Put a Spell on You\u201d to him during a night out with his parents (Keith David and Ella Joyce in cringe-worthy cameos). Mrs. Henderson blatantly asks her son if he\u2019s screwing the soul legend. And Mort sometimes shoots Oyelowo and Saldana gazing at each other with questionable intent. None of this is remotely necessary, and it reeks of desperation. Meanwhile, Henderson tries to reboot Simone\u2019s career, though her past erratic behavior has made her many enemies who won\u2019t book her. Her former agent, Henri (Ronald Guttman) is a hideous lout who repeatedly Whitesplains things to Henderson and who treats Simone like crap. Henri stars in yet another scene from a 2016 movie where a once popular Black musician pulls a gun on a record executive.\u00a0Like all the other scenes of trauma, Mort plays this for laughs that never come. I could go on plot-wise, but instead I\u2019ll ask why this film was even released. Mort has gone on record stating that her vision was reconfigured by the producers of \u201cNina,\" and that she initially wanted her name taken off the finished product. With all the controversy surrounding the casting, it would lack attendance by Simone\u2019s fans, none of whom were happy with Mort\u2019s choice of lead actress. With them gone, who would the audience be for this feature? Biopic fans would pass after taking one look at the amateurish nature of the trailer (which does no justice to how bad the entire film looks and feels). Saldana\u2019s fans, whom the filmmakers were counting on for box office, would shun it as well, because who wants to see an actress they love trapped in a bad movie? One gets the feeling that this is showing up on VOD and at movie theaters near you solely because the producers are delusional in thinking their movie does justice to its subject. And unless the producers re-shot most of the film, Mort should shoulder the blame for how bad it is. \u201cNina\u201d is as offensive and insulting as you\u2019ve heard. Even worse, it spits on the legacy of one of the most important African-American performer-activists in American music history. Agent Henri gets the line that sums up how \u201cNina\u201d feels about its subject: \u201cShe\u2019s a fucked up alcoholic and drug addict, yet people will still pay to see her.\u201d\u00a0Do not pay to see this!\u00a0Nina\u00a0Simone deserves better."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Tiger Zinda Hai", "Review": "The cheese-soaked Bollywood action blockbuster \"Tiger Zinda Hai,\" a big splashy movie where Indian and Pakistani special agents team up to defeat Syrian terrorists holed up in Iraq, is\u00a0retrograde, bloated, and formulaic. It's\u00a0also\u00a0consistently\u00a0sincere,\u00a0energizing, and\u00a0charming.\u00a0 So it's not surprising that \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" is the second highest grossing Indian film of the year (after \"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion\"). This\u00a0is, after all, the kind of chest-thumping, nationalistic spectacle that Peter Berg has, at his best, successfully translated into big\u00a0box office bank here in America.\u00a0\"Tiger Zinda Hai\"\u2014translated from Hindi as \"Tiger is Alive\"\u2014is also the sequel to \"Ek Tha Tiger,\" the #1 2012\u00a0movie at the Indian box office. Why wouldn't it make a mint? Advertisement Arguably, what's most refreshing about \"Tiger Zinda Hai\"\u00a0is that its creators don't just pay lip service to their characters' humanitarian values, and ideas like the makers of \"Ek Tha Tiger\" did.\u00a0For starters, \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" is essentially\u00a0an ensemble film\u00a0headlined by co-stars Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif. This is no small feat since \"Ek Tha Tiger\" feels\u00a0like\u00a0a Salman Khan vehicle that also features Kaif.\u00a0Think of the way that the recent \"Ocean's Eleven\" films\u00a0are pretty much\u00a0\"putting on a show\"-style musicals with more casino heists, and less dancing. In those films, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon put their guys in place, and then let them do their respective things.  That's\u00a0what\u00a0\"Tiger Zinda Hai\"\u00a0is like, only instead of robbing Al Pacino and Andy Garc\u00eda, these guys try to free a group of 25\u00a0Indian and 15\u00a0Pakistani nurses from a group of Syrian/Iraqi fundamentalist kidnappers/terrorists. Indian bureaucrat Shenoy (Girish Karnada)\u00a0knows that\u00a0only one man\u00a0can stop the terrorists, and their\u00a0cartoonishly vindictive\u00a0leader\u00a0Abu Usman (Sajjad Delafrooz). And that man is Tiger (Khan), a retired Indian\u00a0super-spy who at the end of \"Ek Tha Tiger\" eloped with, rather than\u00a0neutralized,\u00a0his\u00a0Pakistani super-spy wife Zoya (Kaif). True to cornball formula, Tiger returns from retirement\u2014\"somewhere in the Alps\"\u2014after briefly considering the consequences of returning to a violent but efficient life of shooting, stabbing, and exploding enemy combatants. Still, Zoya and their young son Junior (Sartaaj Kakkar) give Tiger the green light, so he goes ahead, and assembles a crack team comprised exclusively\u00a0of war movie cliches\u00a0(The dynamite expert! The sniper! The hacker!).\u00a0Thankfully, Zoya and her own team of Pakistani spies join Tiger\u00a0mid-way through the film's\u00a0hefty\u00a0165-minute proceedings. At this point, the group's members\u00a0put their political differences aside, and vow to work together\u00a0for the sake of, uh, all\u00a0\"humanity.\" Advertisement At this point,\u00a0\"Tiger Zinda Hai\" has seemingly\u00a0achieved toxic levels of cheesiness. This is, admittedly, the kind of movie where women are regularly terrorized for the sake of getting a rise out of audiences of either gender, like whenever the kidnapped nurses gasp and\u00a0shriek audibly while bullets and rockets fly\u00a0over their heads. This is also a movie where Khan, without any ironic winking, uses his shirt as a gas mask so he can give audiences two eyes-full of his well-oiled,\u00a0Texas-Steak-sized\u00a0abs and pecs. That kind of self-loving maneuver\u00a0might as well have been swiped\u00a0directly from\u00a0the\u00a0Old Man Tom Cruise playbook.\u00a0 But somehow, \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" transcends its inane nature through the sheer force of its creators'\u00a0convictions. This is, after all,\u00a0the kind of movie where Kaif gets four or five action\u00a0scenes\u2014instead of just a token one or two\u2014to\u00a0flex her muscles. And those sequences\u00a0are some of the best in the film! Just look at\u00a0the bit where Kaif launches\u00a0Tiger, his team, and\u00a0Zoya up a ramp, and over a group of terrorists. Or how about the scene where Kaif gets to dispatch a room full of baddies after putting on a gymnastics, gun-and-sword-fighting, and wire-fu routine that's just as rousing\u2014and arguably more technically polished--than any big set piece\u00a0in \"Wonder Woman.\" This is also the kind of movie where even\u00a0supporting characters like selfish\u00a0Indian mercenary\u00a0Firdaus (Paresh Rawal!) and\u00a0Zoya's fellow Pakistani agents are given time and room enough to show off their skills. See the\u00a0the disarming moment\u2014if totally contrived\u2014moment that Indian and Pakistani agents share talking about their favorite cricket players.\u00a0 So yes, \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" is an action movie\u00a0with more red meat than grey\u00a0matter between its ears. It won't challenge your core beliefs, or tell you anything daring or new (unless you think putting aside your differences for humanity's sake is a radical concept). But it is exceptionally good comfort food cinema because its creators\u00a0take their time here to deliver the kind of preposterous canned action poses and improbably heroic feats that action filmmakers have been repackaging and reheating since the '80s, if not earlier.\u00a0 Advertisement No, the biggest difference between \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" and other recent\u00a0proud-to-be-from-Country-X films like\u00a0\"Wolf Warrior II\" (the highest grossing Chinese film of this year, and of all time) and \"The Admiral: Roaring Currents\" (the\u00a0highest grossing Korean film of 2014, and of all time) is that \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" is superior cheese. How could you say no to a film that concludes with its two\u00a0leads dancing\u00a0joyfully around\u00a0Greek ruins\u00a0while back-up dancers break-dance, twerk, and pop-and-lock behind them? \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" is genuinely charming, and that makes all the difference."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Starlet", "Review": "In another time and another place, \"Starlet\" could have inspired a short story by Chekhov or O. Henry \u2014 a story about two women, one 22, the other 85, who are linked by one of those accidental plot twists explaining why they come together. Indeed, for almost an hour, the story is all the movie is about: That, and performances so effective they're enough all by themselves, even while we know next to nothing about the characters. Jane (Dree Hemingway) is a leggy blonde, the type who causes people to observe, \"she'd be a real beauty, if only she did something with herself.\" She dresses carelessly, does little with her hair and makeup, lives with two roommates in an apartment building in the San Fernando Valley that you could hardly describe if you had to. She sleeps late, has the first of two or three cigarettes for the day, and takes her pet Chihuahua tooling around in search of yard sales.  Advertisement She wanders into a front yard so densely planted that she almost doesn't see the old lady hidden in the shadows. This is Sadie (Besedka Johnson), plainspoken, no-nonsense, with not a shred of \"sweet little old lady\" about her. \"Does this hold dead people?\" she asks, holding up a possible purchase. \"No!\" says Sadie crossly. \"That's a vase! It's a dollar.\" Jane buys it. \"No refunds!\" Sadie tells her. Jane takes it home, cleans it and is surprised to find that the vase is stuffed with rolls of $100 bills, tightly wrapped in rubber bands. She spends some of the money on a fake-diamond dog halter. Her dog is a male, but the halter says \"Starlet,\" so that becomes the dog's name. The dog doesn't care.  Jane thinks to do the right thing. She returns to Sadie's house, knocks on the door, and can't begin speaking before the old lady snarls, \"No refunds!\" Jane has a conscience. She trails Sadie in a taxi, pays the taxi to leave, and is waiting for Sadie when she comes out looking for it. She says she'll give her a ride home. Sadie is immediately suspicious. She's even more standoffish when Jane turns up at her table at her church's weekly bingo game. Sadie doesn't warm easily. She's not looking for a new friend. This may be a spoiler, although the movie's promotion doesn't do enough to conceal it: Jane works for a production company that makes pornos in the Valley. It's a numbing occupation, but Jane hardly seems touched by it. Sex in general seems to mean little in her life, and apart from one mechanical scene, the movie doesn't make much of it. Sadie, in fact, is the most interesting thing that's happened to Jane in a while. She presses herself on the old lady, drives her places, asks her questions.  I learn from Variety that Besedka Johnson, playing Sadie, is a first-time actress who was discovered by the filmmakers at the West Hollywood YMCA. Dree Hemingway is the daughter of Mariel Hemingway, who also played a sexually daring role early in her career, as a Playboy Playmate of the Year in \"Star 80\" (1983). These two women, so very different, are the film's heart and soul, inviting us to decide for ourselves what's beneath their seemingly obvious facades. Advertisement The portrait of the porn industry here suggests a strictly-for-business existence, matter-of-fact, run out of offices filled with computers and file cabinets. Everybody seems to work by routine. Even Jane's roommates, also in porn, are more interested in playing video games. Nor does director Sean Baker seem to make any effort to exploit any particular abilities or cute tricks by the ever-present Chihuahua. This is a low-energy dog who often seems on the lookout for a nap. All leads up to Jane discovering a way she may be able to spend Sadie's money (which she didn't know was in the vase) on her. This involves Jane's discovery of a fact about Sadie's past that, when it finally is revealed, is a little underwhelming. But the film itself deserves praise for its portraits of these two women and the different worlds they inhabit. And if they instructed Besedka Johnson to make no effort to make Sadie sympathetic, it certainly worked. Note: \"Starlet,\" distributed by Chicago-based Music Box Films, is nominated for seven Independent Spirit Awards."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Lola Montes", "Review": "One of the signs of a great director is his ability to sustain a consistent personal tone throughout a film. The work of certain directors can be recognized almost at once; a few hundred feet of Godard or Fellini are sufficient. Max Ophuls was such a director, and his \"Lola Montes\" has as much unity of tone as any film I can remember. It is all of a piece from beginning to end: The mood, the music, the remarkably fluid camera movement, the sets, the costumes. It is a director's film. The actors are in Ophuls' complete control, an additional element in his examination of the romantic myth. Advertisement His story involves the infamous Lola Montes, \"The Most Scandalous Woman in the World,\" the mistress of Franz Liszt and King Ludwig of Bavaria, of students and artists, of soldiers and ringmasters. We find her in a New Orleans circus, the star attraction in a review of her sensational career. Peter Ustinov, the ringmaster, narrates her past as Lola revolves on a platform. Later the customers will have their chance to spend a dollar and kiss her hand. The device of the circus is as successful as it is daring. Using it to supply his narrative thread, Ophuls slides through a series of flashbacks with as much ease, and psychological completeness, as Welles exhibited in \"Citizen Kane.\" The structure of the film is terribly artificial -- flashbacks suspended from a fantasy circus -- and the style itself is a highly mannered romanticism. But it works; Ophuls understands and justifies his method. He is not so successful, unfortunately, with the performance of the late Martine Carol in the title role. Famous in the 1950s as a sort of prototype Bardot, Carol was a third-rate actress, and she comes across as wooden, shallow, not even very attractive. Ophuls apparently needed Carol's box-office name to help justify his $1.5 million budget (this was the most expensive French film to date when it was completed in 1955). He tries to make an advantage of her weakness by directing her almost as a doll; her function is to watch impassively while her lovers save her scenes. The best performance in the film is by Anton Walbrook as the deaf, touching old king. Peter Ustinov is typically excellent. Oskar Werner, as a young student, is not much better than ever. \"Lola Montes\" was a commercial flop when Ophuls released it in 1955, shortened against his will. He died two years later, still engaged in a battle with the film's producers. An even more savagely butchered version was in circulation for a few years. Through the efforts of the Village Voice's Andrew Sarris and other lovers of the film, a somewhat restored version was shown at the first New York Film Festival in 1963 and in an improved version in 1968. In reviews at the time, Sarris called it \"the greatest film of all time.\" Advertisement Now, thanks to the discovery of additional footage and new digital technology, the film finally has been restored to Ophuls' original version, thought lost after the cuts in the 1950s. It showed for the third time at the 2008 New York Film Festival in October. It is now complete and looks better than at any time in its viewing history. In fact, it is breath-taking, an extravaganza of bright circus colors and Ophuls' fluid camera and in wide-screen Cinemascope. It opens today at the Music Box, 3733 N. Southport. This is a revised and lengthened version of an earlier review. Ophuls' \"The Earrings of Madame de...\" is in the Great Movies Collection."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Great Invisible", "Review": "On April 10, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of  Mexico, killing 11 workers on the rig, and dumping what amounted to  almost 5 million barrels of crude into the gulf. The leak continued  without interruption for 87 days, devastating the Gulf coastline, its  wildlife, its beaches and its entire fishing industry (the main source  of income for many in the bayou). BP's lack of response to the initial  spill brought ferocious criticism to the company. BP tried to pass the  blame off onto Transocean, the company to whom they leased the rig.  Years have passed. Many who have put in claims to BP for financial  compensation have yet to see any cash. Just last month, however, a  federal judge stated that BP was the one most responsible for the spill,  and the company could be looking at fines of up to $18 billion. Even in  the oil industry, that is a lot of money. Margaret Brown's documentary  \"The Great Invisible\" personalizes the well-publicized event, bringing  us close to those affected by it, fishermen, survivors and seafood workers: the \"invisible\" victims of the massive catastrophe. Winner of the SXSW  Grand Jury Prize for Documentary, \"The Great Invisible\" is strongest  when it focuses on the micro rather than the macro. How the spill  impacted individuals in the region is the real story of \"The Great  Invisible.\" Advertisement Brown hails from Alabama, and her wonderful 2008 documentary \"The Order  of Myths\" was a full-immersion look at Mobile's long-standing Mardi Gras  celebration (one for whites, one for blacks). It was territory Brown  knew well (her grandfather was interviewed for the documentary), and the  film felt personal and confident. \"The Great Invisible\" lacks that  intimacy, and the fact that BP refused to participate in the making of  the documentary inhibited Brown's approach. Her only \"way in\" was  through the residents of the bayou and those who had worked on the rig.  These are touching interviews, mixed with footage from news stories  about the spill, and C-Span footage of hearings in the U.S. House of  Representatives, where one of the oil company CEOs admitted point-blank  under tough questioning, \"We are not well-equipped to handle\" spills.  All of this was well-documented at the time, the BP spill dominating the  news for weeks. There aren't any revelations in \"The Great Invisible\",  in terms of how poorly the spill was handled, and how badly the region  was impacted. That was front page news. The aftermath lingers, however,  and \"The Great Invisible\" is an urgent reminder. Brown's gift is in the interviews she gets, which include a grieving  father whose son was killed in the explosion and two oil rig workers who  now suffer from a variety of maladies, including PTSD and depression  (one guy pulls W. Somerset Maugham's \"The Razor's Edge\" off of his  crowded bookshelf and explains that he had read it in college, but now  he really \"vibes\" to it in a different way because of what he has gone  through). Brown also interviews many seafood workers in Bayou La Batre,  the seafood capital of Alabama. The shrimp boat captains, the workers  who crack open oysters, the ones whose livelihood dried up post-spill\u2026these are the front-line witnesses to the financial impact. These  details provide texture and understanding of the area. One small boy,  seen in a classroom discussion about the spill, talks with some hurt  about \"everyone up in the Northern states\" who have no concept of  just how bad it is down there. The most interesting man we meet is Roosevelt Harris, a seemingly  full-time volunteer for a local church, who collects donated food and  drives it around to those in need. He is a one-man charity organization.  He cooks up spaghetti, knowing that he may need to feed 300 people. If  there is any information to be imparted about BP's compensation plans,  he is the one who spreads the word. Roosevelt drives through an area  called Hardluck City, where people live in trailers, tents, old school  buses, old boats. These people are off the grid, poverty-struck,  desperate, proud. One guy has nailed up a sign on the side of his  trailer: \"Nothing left to steal.\" Roosevelt is a talker, entertaining  and informative, supportive and optimistic, although at one point he  admits to the camera, \"Alabama's my home state but I declare I wish I been  born somewhere else.\" If there is a hero in \"The Great Invisible,\"  Roosevelt is it. He does good because someone has to do good in this  world. It feels good to help others. Roosevelt understands the social  contract. Advertisement The closest Brown gets to the oil industry is showing the massive oil  conference that occurs every year, with CEOs and executives descending  on Houston from all over the world to present the latest technology,  hob-nob, and bask in their own reflected glory. It's an interesting  glimpse into a world rarely seen. A group of executives go out for  seafood, drink Scotch, smoke cigars, and talk about oil. The  conversation they have is fascinating, as they address the problem of  consumers wanting cheap gasoline, and the challenges of the industry as a  whole. We are all a part of the oil problem as it exists currently, and  these guys know that, and speak knowledgeably about it. Brown chooses  to film their conversation in a pretty heavy-handed way, with closeups  of cigar smoke and platters covered in delicious-looking shellfish, with  the Houston skyline in the background. It is impossible to look at  these guys and not contrast it to the residents of Hardluck City, but it  would be a mistake to dismiss their commentary entirely. The ending of \"The Great Invisible\" leaves one with a hopeless and  enraged feeling, a sense that BP has escaped responsibility entirely,  that nothing has changed and another catastrophic spill is inevitable.  The ruling in September 2014, declaring BP the main culprit of the  spill, could be a watershed moment. BP has contested the ruling, and  there will be a lengthy appeals process, but no one can say now that BP  has escaped responsibility. United States Attorney General Eric H.  Holder Jr. said in response to the ruling, \u201cWe are pleased. The court\u2019s  finding will ensure that the company is held fully accountable for its  recklessness.\" Let's hope."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Confessions of a Shopaholic", "Review": "I like \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" about as much as I disliked \"Sex and the City.\" Both are about clueless women, but this one knows it. \"SATC\" is about women searching for love in most of the wrong places, and \"Shopaholic\" is about a woman searching for happiness in the places that are absolutely right for her: Prada, Gucci, Macy's, Barneys, Saks and on down the avenue. The plotting is on automatic pilot. It needs Chesley B. Sullenberger III. There is not a single unanticipated blip in the story arc. But here's what sort of redeems it: It glories in its silliness, and the actors are permitted the sort of goofy acting that distinguished screwball comedy. We get double takes, slow burns, pratfalls, exploding clothes wardrobes, dropped trays, tear-away dresses, missing maids of honor, overnight fame, public disgrace and not, amazingly, a single obnoxious cat or dog. Advertisement At the center of this maelstrom is a genuinely funny comedienne named Isla Fisher. She reminds me of Lucille Ball, and not only because she's a redhead. She does one of the most difficult things any actress can do, which is physical comedy: Walk into doors, drop trays, fall into people, go ass over teakettle. She plays a Perfect Ditz in the sense of the Perfect Storm, carrying all before her. Give her a fan and 20 seconds of tango lessons, and get off the floor. It is to the credit of the director, P.J. Hogan of \"My Best Friend's Wedding,\" that he gives Fisher freedom and yet modulates it, so her character's earnest desire to please shines through. It was the same on \"I Love Lucy.\" Lucy wasn't a klutz because she was trying to look funny. She was a klutz because she was trying not to. Fisher plays Rebecca Bloomwood, the only child of blue-collar parents (Joan Cusack and John Goodman), who has been reborn as a Most Preferred Customer through the miracle of credit cards. She begins with a narration describing the nearly erotic bliss she feels while shopping, and we follow her through store after store in an endless cycle of accessorizing outfits, and then buying outfits to match the accessories. It's like the dilemma of the 10 hot dogs and eight buns: You can never come out even at the end. She dreams of working for a famous fashion magazine, but stumbles, literally, into a money management magazine published by the same company. How does this woman who knows nothing about money or its management get the job? By impressing the editor (Hugh Dancy) with her eccentric brilliance. Everything she does that's wrong turns out right. Also she benefits from a brave roommate, Suze (Krysten Ritter), who plays the Ethel Mertz role: co-conspirator and occasional voice of reason. Meanwhile, the villainous bill collector Derek Smeath (Robert Stanton) is on her trail, hints that breaking her legs is not out of the question and eventually has one of the funnier scenes in the movie. After she gains (highly improbable) international fame overnight on the basis of her writing, it would destroy her, she fears, to be unmasked. Whether it does or not, I leave it to your experience of cinematic plotting to determine. Look. \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" is no masterpiece. But it's funny, Isla Fisher is a joy, and -- of supreme importance -- it is more entertaining to a viewer with absolutely no eagerness to see it (like me) than \"Sex and the City\" was. Also, no movie can be all bad where the heroine attends a Shopaholics Anonymous meeting and meets a former Chicago Bulls star. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire", "Review": "Precious has shut down. She avoids looking at people, she hardly ever speaks, she's nearly illiterate. Inside her lives a great hurt, and also her child, conceived in a rape. She is fat. Her clothes are too tight. School is an ordeal of mocking cruelty. Home is worse. Her mother, defeated by life, takes it out on her daughter. After Precious is raped by her father, her mother, is angry not at the man, but at the child for \"stealing\" him. There's one element in the film that redeems this landscape of despair. That element is hope. Not the hope of Precious, but that of two women who want better for her. It's not that Precious \"shows promise.\" I think it's that these women, having in their jobs seen a great deal, can hardly imagine a girl more obviously in pain. Advertisement That is the starting point for \"Precious,\" a great American film that somehow finds an authentic way to move from these beginnings to an inspiring ending. Gabourey \"Gabby\" Sidibe, a young actress in her debut performance as Precious, says, \"I know this girl. I know her in my family, I know her in my friends, I've seen her, I've lived beside this girl.\" We may have seen her, too, if we looked. People often don't really look. They see, evaluate, dismiss. Sidibe is heartbreaking as Precious, that poor girl. Three other actresses perform so powerfully in the film that academy voters will be hard-pressed to choose among them. Audiences may be hard-pressed to recognize them. The comedian Mo'Nique plays Mary, Precious' chain-smoking couch potato of a mother, treating her daughter like a domestic servant and turning a blind eye on years of abuse. Paula Patton is Ms. Rain, Precious' teacher, who is able to see through the girl's sullen withdrawal and her vulgarities, and wonder what pain it may be masking. Mariah Carey is Ms. Weiss, a social worker. This casting looks almost cynical on paper, as if reflecting old Hollywood days when stars were slipped into \"character roles\" with a wink. But Lee Daniels, the director, didn't cast them for their names, and actually doesn't use any of their star qualities. He requires them to act. Somehow he was able to see beneath the surface and trust that they had within the emotional resources to play these women, and he was right. Daniels began his career by producing \"Monster's Ball,\" in which Halle Berry shed her glamour and found such depths that she won an Oscar. Daniels must have an instinct for performances waiting to flower. Carey and Patton are equal with Sidibe in screen impact; the film holds the girl in the center of their attempt to save her future. Why would a teacher and a social worker go to such lengths to intervene? They must see tragic victims of abuse every day. Mary, the mother, is perhaps not a bad woman but simply one defeated by the forces she now employs against her daughter. Mo'Nique is frighteningly convincing. The film is a tribute to Sidibe's ability to engage our empathy. Her work is still another demonstration of the mystery of some actors, who evoke feelings in ways beyond words and techniques. She so completely creates the Precious character that you rather wonder if she's very much like her. You meet Sidibe, who is engaging, outgoing and 10 years older than her character, and you're almost startled. She's not at all like Precious, but in her first performance, she not only understands this character but knows how to make her attract the sympathy of her teacher, the social worker -- and ourselves. I don't know how she does it but there you are. My interview with \u201cGabby\u201d Sidibe. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Mechanic: Resurrection", "Review": "Usually, when a studio declines to screen a movie for\r\nreviewers, the reflexive assumption is that the picture is a dog. This largely\r\nturns out to be true, but not always. As for \u201cMechanic: Resurrection,\u201d the disinclination of\r\nLionsgate to present it to viewers was a little puzzling in a different\r\nrespect. Sure, the 2011 film \u201cThe Mechanic,\u201d a Jason Statham/Ben Foster starring remake\r\nof the 1972 Charles Bronson/Jan-Michael Vincent master hitman thriller, only\r\ngot a 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but I thought it was pretty okay,\r\nand that\u2019s all that counts. Given that the sequel pairs off Statham\u2019s\r\nimplacable best-of-the-best anonymous assassin with charming genre movie mascot\r\nJessica Alba, and has Tommy Lee Jones third-billed or so, with Hong Kong\r\neminence Michelle Yeoh rounding out the supporting cast, well, how bad could it\r\nbe? Advertisement Not good, is the answer, learned at an early Thursday\r\nevening screening. Despite some of the most picturesque locations money can\r\nbuy, and some not unimpressive looking movable props (yachts with helipads and\r\nsuch) and so on, \u201cMechanic: Resurrection\u201d suffers from a storyline and script\r\nthat strains credulity and insults intelligence even by the low bar set by the\r\nmajority of contemporary action movies.\u00a0 The picture opens with Statham\u2019s Arthur Bishop\r\ncomfortably ensconced, \u00e0 la Travis McGee, on a houseboat in Rio. The steadiness\r\nof the houseboat is such that Bishop, now known as Santos, can rock out with a\r\nvinyl turntable. But not for long. Lunching at his favorite cliffside outdoor\r\nrestaurant, he\u2019s approached by a femme fatale who Knows Who He Really Is, and\r\nwho tells him her \u201cPrincipal\u201d wants him to kill three targets. Santos/Bishop\u2019s\r\nviolent refusal to play ball is met with an attack by a small military\r\nbattalion\u2019s worth of men. Not only does this action sequence fail to build a\r\nhead of steam, but the lack of logic is a little startling. I need you to kill\r\nthese men for me, because only you can do it, and if you refuse, I will kill\r\nyou myself. Spot the flaw in this thinking.  Bishop of course escapes, and regroups at a seaside village\r\nin Thailand, watched over by old pal Mei, played by Yeoh. Soon enough a honey\r\ntrap with Alba as the bait makes itself known. But Alba\u2019s not a villainess. Her\r\ncharacter, Gina, is being extorted in a sense by supervillain Crain, a bland\r\nSam Hazeldine. If Gina doesn\u2019t play ball, Crain\u2019s going to torch the Cambodian\r\norphanage at which Gina is a beloved fixture. Yes, you read that right.  Tending to Gina\u2019s wounds in one scene, Mei says to her\r\npatient, \u201cMy father was a doctor of Eastern medicine. He was a healer.\u201d Well,\r\nyes, I would hope so. Later in the movie, Gina says to Bishop, \u201cThose kids are\r\neverything to me. If they get trafficked or killed I just couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d\r\nBishop responds, \u201cI was an orphan too.\u201d Wow. This isn\u2019t just a character note:\r\nit\u2019s a plot point. Crain was a childhood friend of Bishop back at the\r\norphanage. This wasn\u2019t particularly convincing in the last James Bond film and\r\nit works even less here, although if you choose to buy it you may wonder what\r\nit is with British orphanages that make them turn out such efficient killers.\r\nThere\u2019s also the matter of the phrasing of the dialogue itself. \u201cIf they get\r\ntrafficked or killed\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly roll off the tongue. Alba is an\r\nappealing screen presence (and director Daniel Gansel takes some advantage of\r\nthis with a few beach-set shots of the sort that they used to call\r\n\u201ccheesecake\u201d). She is not the most virtuoso actor, but not even Meryl Streep\r\ncould make such dialogue sing.  It\u2019s kind of perplexing: clearly not too much expense was\r\nspared in the beautiful locations and blow-stuff-up effects tech. Writers in\r\nevery industry come cheaper and cheaper these days; surely the producers could\r\nhave invested some of their financing in a script with more\r\ninventiveness and engagement power than the one they had on set. Of\r\ncourse, this still would have left the uninspired direction of Gansel. Might\r\nhe have delivered something more enjoyable with better material? We\u2019ll never\r\nknow. As for Tommy Lee Jones, his role as a roguish arms dealer is not much more than\r\na cameo, for which he chooses to repeat many of the performing riffs he\r\nworked to good effect way way back in 1992\u2019s \u201cUnder Siege,\u201d the elemental but\r\nenjoyable action film that kind of made Jones into a big star. His work here is\r\none of two pieces of wit the movie has to offer; the other is courtesy of production designers Sebastian T. Krawinkel and Antonello Rubino, who\r\nplace a replica of the sculpture in the Mosfilm logo title shot in the\r\nrepository of Soviet kitsch that serves as Jones\u2019 character\u2019s panic room.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Siddharth", "Review": "Mahendra Saini (Rajesh Tailang) is a chain-wallah who peddles his zipper repair skills on the streets of Delhi. Armed with a megaphone, Mahendra markets himself to anyone within earshot. As with any service-oriented business, location is everything. So when his usual beat stops being fruitful, Mahendra\u2019s 12-year old son, Siddharth, is recruited to earn a second income. Mahendra\u2019s brother-in-law, Ranjit (Anurag Arora) suggests a trolley factory where child labor, though illegal, is a means of income. Siddharth travels to the factory unharmed, but two weeks before he is to return home, he disappears. Advertisement \u201cSiddharth\u201d uses this story to comment on the state of abducted and runaway children in India. It defies expectation by resisting the potentially exploitative aspects of its subject matter. Instead, director and co-writer Richie Mehta focuses on the parental and societal response to Siddharth\u2019s disappearance. Mahendra sets out on an exhausting journey to find his son, and each person he encounters, from the police, to child services, to the factory manager who hired Siddharth, reacts in a nonchalant manner. It\u2019s as if the disappearance of a child has become so commonplace that it has lost its shock value and outrage. A sense of hopelessness invades every frame of \u201cSiddharth,\u201d yet its story is not emotionally manipulative. Those looking for the typical children-in-peril style mystery, one that ends with a standard resolution, will be dissatisfied. It is clear early on that Siddharth\u2019s disappearance will be used in service to a much bigger issue, and that we may never find out his whereabouts. As Mahendra\u2019s search goes on, its sense of dramatic urgency is tempered by the realism of Mahendra\u2019s financial situation. As much as he\u2019d like to drop everything to seek out his son, these monetary issues force a much slower call to action. As the film waits for Mahendra to earn enough money to buy a train or bus ticket to track down his latest lead, time mercilessly passes.  \u201cChildren missing longer than two days are very hard to find,\u201d one child services rep tells Mahendra. \u201cYour son\u2019s been gone two weeks.\u201d  When Mahendra files a report with his local police chief, she abruptly scolds him for his actions. \u201cYou people never learn,\u201d she says. She lectures him on how far too many people opt to send their children to work illegally rather than put them in schools. \u201cHe was going to have to work sometime,\u201d Mahendra protests, though this is his pride speaking. Like so many others faced with this decision, he would rather have been the sole breadwinner in the family than farm out his kid. His economic situation forced his hand. Advertisement To its detriment, \u201cSiddharth\u201d doesn\u2019t focus enough on the economic aspect of the problem. It does, however, explore how the Saini family dynamic is affected after their son disappears. Mahendra\u2019s wife, Suman (Tannishtha Chatterjee, in a fine performance) shows more outward emotion than her husband. She has a very good scene where she echoes the same commentary Mahendra heard from the police chief. She chides him for not being able to support his family, blaming him for their tragedy. When Mahendra points out that Suman supported sending Siddharth away, her retort speaks volumes about how much say she has in decision-making: \u201cI didn\u2019t approve. I remained silent.\u201d  In a seemingly more sinister context, Ranjit also remains silent. He knew about Siddharth\u2019s disappearance far longer than Mahendra and Suman did. The factory owner, Om Prakash (Amitabh Srivasta), reported to Ranjit that Siddharth ran away from the factory long before his work contract ended. That Ranjit doesn\u2019t report this, and his reasons for not doing so, are weak spots in the script. An even bigger problem is the idea that, despite having cell phones, neither parent has a picture of their son. Whether a picture or a quicker response from Ranjit would have changed the final outcome remains unknown, though a large shadow of doubt is cast by \u201cSiddharth\u2019s\u201d resolution. The film follows Mahendra on every lead he has while trying to find his son. It takes him to the factory, where Siddharth\u2019s roommate suggests a location he\u2019s heard missing children are found, and to that location in Mumbai. Rather than stoking suspense, Mehta uses these trips to provide information and social commentary. I wish the film\u2019s tone were angrier while delivering its message, though I think the lack of outright anger is Mehta\u2019s point. More than once, the people Mahendra encounters express a cavalier attitude toward his missing kid (\u201cYou can always make another one,\u201d one person tells him), but others share his frustration. A social worker shows empathy, but ultimately laments \u201cwe\u2019re underfunded as it is,\u201d when Mahendra seeks her help. Advertisement Tailing underplays his emotions\u2014sometimes too much\u2014but late in the film, he\u2019s very good at depicting scenes of Mahendra\u2019s stress-fueled unraveling. The last few minutes of \u201cSiddharth\u201d find him engaging in two brutally honest conversations. The second is with Mahendra\u2019s father, who provides a seemingly vicious though realistic piece of advice. The first conversation is with runaway Mumbai street kids who ask stinging yet pertinent questions before one nonchalantly states the sad truth that Mahendra may have to accept. \u201cMaybe Siddharth got lucky and left this world.\u201d \u201cSiddharth\u201d leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether this lucky notion is a comfort or a tragedy."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Lebanon", "Review": "\"Lebanon,\" written and directed by Israeli filmmaker Samuel Maoz, is an immersive war-movie experience like \"The Hurt Locker,\" but turned inside out. Or, perhaps more accurately, outside in. Kathryn Bigelow's Oscar-winning combat picture propels us out into the open with an American bomb squad in Iraq \u2014 surrounded from every angle by gazing eyes, cameras and telescopes. Maoz's film, winner of the Golden Lion at the 2009 Venice Film Festival, shuts us into a tank with an Israeli crew on a mission in Lebanon for virtually its entire running time.  Advertisement So the sensations of overheated overexposure the audience shares with the characters in \"The Hurt Locker\" are replaced by a sweltering claustrophobia in \"Lebanon.\" Both movies are stylistically experimental films of a sort: At one extreme, there are Bigelow's rapid-fire, multi-camera orchestrations of light and space and distance; at the other, Maoz's compression of desert warfare into the confines of a single dark metal box. With the exception of three shots \u2014 the opening and two closing images \u2014 everything we see is inside, or from inside, the tank. Because we're at such close quarters, the main characters \u2014 a commander, a gunner, a loader and a driver \u2014 never appear whole within the frame, only as dismembered figures: faces, heads, torsos, legs, feet. There's not enough room in this cramped mechanical compartment for entire human beings.  What's happening in the world outside is gleaned only through the blinkered perspective of a scope marked with crosshairs, enhanced when necessary by night-vision technology. Occasionally, this point of view shifts into a more psychologically subjective telephoto view (signaled by a metallic thunk on the soundtrack), almost as if an optometrist had flipped to another lens, bringing a piece of your vision into sharper focus. What the men see and hear out there is horrific.  Even worse, the victims of the chaos outside sometimes stare right at the lens, as if they can see into the souls of the humans behind it, hunkered down within the machine. These moments are piercing reminders that we, along with those manning the tank, are \u2014 for all the heavy armor around us \u2014 not just observers, witnesses, voyeurs. We are participants in what is going on out there.  Sometimes, when the hatch opens, the outside comes in: the steely officer who keeps returning to give mission orders, the bloodied body of a slain Israeli soldier, a Syrian hostage. At times, it feels like we're trapped in an absurdist nightmare by Samuel Beckett or Edward Albee, dreading not only where this bucket is headed, but who or what might suddenly drop in. This is a platoon picture in a rumbling, rolling crate. Like all such movies (Samuel Fuller's quintessential \"The Big Red One\" comes to mind), the structure of \"Lebanon\" is anecdotal, with scenes built around the inevitable atrocities of war that can seem as commonplace as cliches until you see them realized again this vividly. When, for example, a new gunner finds himself unable to shoot at an oncoming car (he can see the driver's face too clearly \u2014 or imagines he can), the tragic consequences for his fellow soldiers, and the next vehicle that comes along, are compounded by his failure of nerve.  Advertisement Maoz was 20 years old when he served as an Israeli tank gunner during the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Like World War II vet Fuller, he has the ability to fuse the immediacy and authenticity of his wartime experience with images bold enough to bear the weight of their metaphors. Engraved on the inside of the tank are the words: \u201cMan is steel. The tank is only iron.\u201d Like the Nostromo in \"Alien,\" the sweating, groaning tank is a fusion of flesh and machine. The floor of the vessel is a festering stew of foul liquids (water, oil, urine) and decomposing solids (cigarette butts, ammo shells, soda cans, spilled rations). This is what it means to be in the belly of the beast."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Misery Loves Comedy", "Review": "It's hard to tell if Kevin Pollak's documentary \"Misery Loves Comedy\" is too much of a good thing or not enough.  In the abstract, it would seem to have everything it needs to be a totally satisfying nonfiction feature about the history and craft of standup comedy and the personality types that tend to be drawn to it. And it couldn't ask for a more outwardly suitable director. Pollak is a brilliant standup comic himself, and a killer impressionist, and a fine actor who's spent lots of time on film sets absorbing the craft of movie storytelling.  Advertisement He's also very much an insider in the tightly knit world of standup, somebody who's probably logged thousands of hours standing in spotlights in front of brick walls, which means there's no working comedian of any age with a brain in his or her head who wouldn't be willing to follow him as he leads them into more personal terrain than they're maybe used to visiting in interviews. Judging solely from the lineup of talking heads assembled here\u2014a murderer's row that includes Larry David, Whoopi Goldberg, Amy Schumer, Jimmy Fallon, Martin Short, Christopher Guest, Janeane Garofalo, Kumail Nanjiani, Jason Alexander and forty other boldfaced names\u2014he's a man who commands an extraordinary degree of trust, and this is confirmed when you hear the subjects open up to his skillful questions.  Freddie Prinze, Jr., for one, talks about how he was more or less ordered into standup comedy by his grandfather after his troubled dad, star of TV's \"Chico and the Man,\" committed suicide, in order to \"fix what your father fucked up.\" Nearly every other comedian who's included in the \"origins\" portion of the documentary shares some version of a tragic, or at least uncomfortable, backstory, as well as a feeling of emptiness that could only be filled by hearing the laughter of strangers. Comedy as catharsis and a means of public sharing also gets a segment; the emotional peak is Maria Bamford talking about the first time she used her stint in a mental hospital as fuel for a routine, and heard audience members shouting out their own traumas in response. We also hear secondhand stories about Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Sam Kinison and other standup legends whose demons fueled their art and set fire to the personal lives.  The problem, unfortunately, is that Pollak's film isn't content to zero in on the assertion promised by the title: \"Misery Loves Comedy.\" That phrase clearly holds true for the people interviewed here: to some degree, they're all people whose unhappiness drove them to make people laugh, then perhaps try to steer that laughter towards shared introspection. (\"What kind of clown are you?\" somebody asks Bill Murray's Bozo-garbed bank robber in \"Quick Change,\" to which he replies, \"The crying on the inside kind, I guess.\") But that's not the focus. In fact it's often difficult to say what the film's focus actually is; a more accurate title might've been \"Bits and Pieces of Interviews with 50 Comedians,\" but that wouldn't fit on most marquees. Advertisement While genial and never dull, the film is all over the place, a classic example of trying to do and say too much. There are dozens of biographical nuggets, including anecdotes about being the class clown, and lots of discussion of the practical aspects of standup, including how it feels when a line bombs, how it makes the comic feel, and the various ways they've reacted to failure; these are edited together (by Robert Legato) skillfully, sometimes brilliantly, as when several subjects seem to be telling variations of the same story and the movie cuts between them so that they all seem to be collectively participating in the construction of one very long sentence. This sort of cleverness unfortunately doesn't counteract the nagging feeling that \"Misery Loves Comedy\" is trying to turn a liability (too many subjects, too many stories, too much repetition) into a creative asset, when the wiser, though admittedly much harder move might've been to cut twenty or thirty or forty of the interviewees out of the film, the better to focus on the most complex, fascinating and charismatic subjects, and let their stories breathe, and in the process, allow a goodhearted but scattered film to find something like a calm center."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Promotion", "Review": "\"The Promotion\" is a human comedy about two supermarket employees who are always ill at ease. It's their state of being. I felt a little ill at ease watching it because I was never quite sure whether I was supposed to be laughing at them or feeling sorry for them. It's one of those off-balance movies that seems searching for the right tone. The setting: a Chicago supermarket. The central characters: Doug (Seann William Scott), 33, a loyal employee, and Richard (John C. Reilly), mid-30s, a Canadian who has emigrated to America with his Scottish wife, Laurie (Lili Taylor), and their daughter. Doug is recently married to Jen (Jenna Fischer). When their supermarket chain decides to open a new store, the two men are in line for a promotion to store manager. Advertisement They both desperately desire and need this job. Doug has convinced his wife he's a \"shoo-in,\" and they invest all of their savings in a non-refundable deposit on a house. Richard is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, now in AA, trying to prove he is a trustworthy husband and father. The two men fight for the job not in a slapstick way but in an understated, underhanded way that Doug feels bad about, Richard not so much. (\"We're all just out here to get some food,\" Richard philosophizes. \"Sometimes we bump into each other.\") The movie is unusually quiet and introspective for a comedy. Doug provides a narration, and Richard gets one of his own in the form of a self-help tape he obsessively listens to. Doug decides Richard is a \"nice guy,\" and observes, \"All Canadians are nice.\" That's before Richard fakes an injury to lodge a dreaded \"in-store complaint\" that could cost Doug his job. Richard himself is on a self-destruct mission. Consider an episode when Doug hits a young black man who has thrown a bottle of Yoo-Hoo at him in the parking lot. Doug apologizes to a \"community forum,\" backed up by a panel including Richard and the store's board of directors. He says something about \"a few bad apples.\" Apology accepted. Afterward, however, when they're all standing around relieved, Richard tells one of the community leaders, \"You are not a black apple to me.\" Explaining this digs him in deeper, until he's reduced to speechlessness. He has a gift for saying the wrong things at the wrong times. Richard actually is nice at times. As a member of a motorcycle gang, he once watched his fellow members roar through a toll gate without paying, and then sheepishly told the collector, \"I'll pay for them all.\" Doug empathizes with Richard, even to the point of defending him to the board, but he feels rotten inside: Having lied to his wife that he has the job, he finds a present of long-sleeve shirts they can't afford. He's afraid he's stuck in the ranks of the short-sleeve guys. I was interested in the fates of these two men, but mildly. I was expecting to laugh but I only smiled. Some of the race-based situations made me feel uncomfortable. All of the characters, especially the straight-arrow chairman of the board (Gil Bellows), needed to be pushed further into the realms of comedy. More could have been done with the store's other employees. At the end of \"The Promotion,\" I wondered what the atmosphere was like on the set every day. How does it feel to make a movie where the characters don't seem sure about who they are? Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Hot Pursuit", "Review": "As a movie, \u201cHot Pursuit\u201d can barely be said to exist.

Is that possible for a movie like\r\nthis?) won\u2019t bother you all that much. And you\u2019ll also deserve congratulation,\r\nI suppose for being a very easygoing movie viewer. In any event: here\r\nWitherspoon plays Cooper (the fact that nobody ever refers to her by her first\r\nname is kind of a \u201ccharacter point\u201d) a perky and ultra by-the-book\r\ngoody-two-shoes cop who gets what she thinks is a dream assignment when she\u2019s\r\ntold to escort a witness in a drug-lord case to her Grand Jury appointment.\r\nThat witness is Vergara\u2019s Daniella, who\u2019s very Vergara: brash, blinged-out,\r\nsuper confident and a potential fount of English-language malapropism, although\r\nthe film doesn\u2019t, for better or worse, exploit that last bit of comic potential\r\nmuch.\u00a0 Rather, after a scene in which both another witness and a bonafide\r\nFederal Marshall are killed\u2014you\u2019ll notice that by opening with a double murder,\r\nyou get the comic tone set and fixed right there\u2014Witherspoon and Vergara\u2019s\r\ncharacters spend a lot of energy and time insulting each others personal\r\nappearances, pausing only to outwit the bad guys who wanna kill them via an\r\noutpouring of guilt power. The funniest bit is the most biologically graphic,\r\nin which the duo convince their potential assassins to grant them a bathroom\r\nbreak by describing human female menstruation in detail to the grossed-out Evil\r\nBros. Powerful Sisterhood, however, consistently eludes Cooper and Daniella, as\r\nthe script\u2019s too-busy and eventually utterly beside-the-point plot twists\r\ncompel Vergara\u2019s redeemable Bad Girl to keep stabbing Cooper in the back. Okay,\r\nmaybe that\u2019s too strong. More like she kicks her in the shins and runs.\r\nLiterally. And over and over again.  The energy, commitment, and good will displayed by the lead\r\nperformers is pretty much the movie\u2019s only redeeming quality.

Those films were not terribly substantial, but at least their makers\r\nhad some sense of story carpentry, even when the story served no purpose except\r\nto let the top dogs riff. They would not, for instance, kick off the action of\r\ntheir scenarios with a scene of a cop getting murdered. They\u2019d find another way\r\nto get their characters into a fix. I\u2019m not saying this because I found the set\r\nup of \u201cHot Pursuit\u201d to be actually offensive. Just lazy. Really, really lazy. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "A Bag of Marbles", "Review": "There was a time in which films set during the Holocaust were made with the expressed intention of keeping history alive for future generations. For my junior high history class, I analyzed three movies that observed the impact of Nazi atrocities from strikingly different perspectives\u2014the encroaching dread of a family in hiding in George Stevens\u2019 \u201cThe Diary of Anne Frank,\u201d the visceral horrors of a concentration camp in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and the monstrous denial of Nazi judges on trial in Stanley Kramer\u2019s \u201cJudgment at Nuremberg.\u201d As a kid, this unofficial trilogy served as a sobering illustration of the unthinkable evil committed by ordinary human beings when their minds are warped by intolerance. Spielberg\u2019s film has routinely been criticized for choosing to focus on those who survived rather than perished, yet it was always the senseless slaughter\u2014depicted with newsreel-level realism by Janusz Kaminski\u2019s camera\u2014that remained unforgettably etched in my memory. What cinema once strived to remind us has now become impossible to forget, as Nazism has received newfound empowerment from politicians whose careers have been built on the stoking of fear and hatred in voters. Holocaust films were always educating us about our past as well as our present, and that truth has perhaps never been more apparent than in the months following last August\u2019s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Advertisement The great value of Christian Duguay\u2019s \u201cA Bag of Marbles\u201d is the degree to which it makes such a barbaric and bewildering chapter in human history comprehensible for young audiences. Yes, the film recounts a real-life tale of survival, but the fate of its lead protagonists in no way diminishes the grueling hardships they face on every step of their journey. Based on the 1973 memoir of the same name by Joseph Joffo, which was previously adapted for the screen by Jacques Doillon shortly after its publication, this film aims to construct, in Joffo\u2019s own words, a more \u201chonest\u201d portrayal of the author\u2019s experiences as a Jewish youth in occupied France. This isn\u2019t the sort of somber, slow-paced dirge guaranteed to make students fall asleep in a dimly lit classroom. I imagine junior high-age kids will be wholly absorbed by every moment of this two-hour picture, which is wrenching and scary when it needs to be, yet also contains stretches of whimsy that are earned rather than forced. The vast majority of scenes are viewed from the perspective of 10-year-old Joseph (Dorian Le Clech), who must flee from his home in Paris in order to reach a \u201cfree zone\u201d in Nice, while accompanied by his 12-year-old brother, Maurice (Batyste Fleurial). Duguay and his screenwriters allow these characters to behave like actual children instead of miniature adults, even as they\u2019re forced to grow up much faster than they would\u2019ve preferred. Humor and wonder will often sneak into our lives when we least expect them to materialize, and as Joseph and Maurice embark on their arduous journey, they embrace any opportunity to distract themselves from the harsh reality of their plight, whether it be frolicking in a sun-drenched field or toying with one another in brotherly fashion. Adding immeasurably to the film\u2019s tone is composer Armand Amar, who previously scored \u201cBelle & Sebastian,\u201d another family film about a child outwitting Nazis.\u00a0 As the boys first set out on their escape from Paris, there is a sweeping effects shot of a train chugging along a bridge, as the camera closes in on Joseph\u2019s face framed in the window. The shot is quite similar to the one in \u201cHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\u201d which occurs just before the titular hero encounters a Nazi-esque Dementor on his Hogwarts-bound train. Other touches are positively Spielbergian, from the faceless men wielding predatory beams of light in a forest to the heroic American planes viewed from a rooftop, signaling the impending liberation of our protagonists. This joyous image was viewed from an even more glorified angle in Spielberg\u2019s \u201cEmpire of the Sun,\u201d another fact-based account of a boy\u2019s survival amidst occupying forces\u2014in his case, that of the Japanese\u2014during WWII. Just as the debut performance of 13-year-old Christian Bale served as the emotional anchor of \u201cEmpire,\u201d so does the wonderful work of newcomer Le Clech for this film. Not once does his acting strain to tug at the heartstrings with shameless sentimentality. When tears start to form in his eyes, he often struggles to contain them, such as when his father, Roman (Patrick Bruel), resorts to bruising methods in order to teach his boys a crucial lesson. Having survived anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia at a young age, Roman knows that his children must be equipped to deal with pain so that they won\u2019t be killed in order to avoid being hurt later. To prepare Joseph for Nazi interrogations, he slaps him repeatedly while demanding to know whether the boy is Jewish. This act of performance is no less improvisational or necessary as the moment when Roman\u2019s wife, Anna (Elsa Zylberstein), talks her family out of a tight corner by taking offense to a Nazi\u2019s claim that she was playing Jewish music on her violin.\u00a0 Bruel may initially seem rather aloof as Joseph\u2019s father, yet the coolness of his demeanor is fueled by his need to put on a strong face for his family. Two of his scenes are among the most deeply moving in the picture, the first being when Roman is faced with leaving his boys\u00a0for another prolonged period of time. Only when turning away from his children does he allow his face to collapse in despair. Equally indelible is the shot of Roman sitting in the back of a car as Joseph and Maurice sleep on either side of him, resting their heads on his shoulders. Everything about this shot is hauntingly bittersweet, as the father savors this isolated moment of peace before the world intrudes on them again. Like its characters, \u201cA Bag of Marbles\u201d is perpetually on the move, running from one location to the next as the brothers must rely on the kindness of strangers while simultaneously keeping their guard up. It\u2019s to the film\u2019s credit that many of these side characters come off as vividly realized people in their own right, including the SS chief who develops an obsession with the boys and the two good Christian men who protect the children as if they were their own kin. Editor Olivier Gajan has a background in music videos, and there were some occasions where I wished he had held on a shot for a beat longer before cutting to the next sequence. The boys\u2019 first reunion with their parents is so abrupt and so awash in white light that I assumed it was a dream sequence, and in a sense, it is\u2014conveying a sense of lasting tranquility that the characters will never be able to obtain together. The audience is often lulled into a sense of contentment before malevolence rears its head unexpectedly\u2014in one case, it takes the form of silence so protracted it grows sickening. Gajan\u2019s editing is most effective in scenes where he ups the tension with quick cuts, accentuating how every second counts for these characters, such as when the sun peers out from a cloudy sky, alerting Joseph to imminent danger he would\u2019ve otherwise overlooked.\u00a0 Advertisement Over the years, some critics have debated the accuracy of Joffo\u2019s text, insisting that the writer couldn\u2019t possibly have remembered the events as clearly as he had written of them decades later. Even if \u201cA Bag of Marbles\u201d is more of a parable based in reality, that puts it in good standing among classics like \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d of which it shares many a meaningful climb up vertiginous mountains. For much of its running time, Duguay\u2019s film succeeds as a very good historical drama, but in its final act, it blossoms into a near-great one. Le Clech beautifully captures the courageous spirit of his character, who didn\u2019t shy away from hurling a Nazi into a lamp when the man started beating on his brother. Rather than cry for his mommy, Joseph is often heard uttering the indignant refrain, \u201cI\u2019m so sick of this.\u201d As swastika-bearing flags are finally torn down from France and Nazi collaborators are pummeled in the streets, Joseph makes a decision so pure and heartfelt that it had me applauding. It\u2019s a moment that echoes a slight of hand administered by his father at the film\u2019s opening, which he performed as a way of tricking Nazis into acknowledging the humanity in people they supposedly reviled. Joseph\u2019s selfless act at the end of this movie embodies a long-held belief I\u2019ve had that has been continuously affirmed by modern day heroes such as Malala Yousafzai, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez and Sonita Alizadeh. If I am certain about anything these days, it\u2019s that young people speaking their truth will be our salvation."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Voyeur", "Review": "Superficially, Gay Talese and Gerald Foos would seem to have nothing in common besides their age. The former is a veteran, celebrated New York writer: the impeccably dressed and highly influential pioneer of New Journalism. The latter is a former Colorado motel owner: a hot-tempered, heavyset man who lives in paranoid suburban seclusion. But as they come together as interviewer and subject in the documentary \u201cVoyeur,\u201d it becomes clear how many traits they share\u2014and how their decades-long connection reveals uncomfortable truths about both themselves and human nature. Advertisement Directors Myles Kane and Josh Koury spent years with these men, documenting their unlikely friendship and mutual fascination. Both Talese and Foos are raconteurs with larger-than-life senses of self. Both are obsessive collectors who have crammed their basements with tidily catalogued items: Talese of the articles, photographs, notes and memorabilia from a life spent in journalism; Foos of the baseball cards, coins, stamps and dolls he hopes will make him a fortune one day. And both are fascinated with sex\u2014Foos to such an extent that he bought a motel in Aurora, Colorado, in the late 1960s, built a hidden observation platform in the attic above the rooms and spied on his guests through the vents. With his dyed hair and beard and oversized, smoked eyeglasses, Foos explains in richly resonant tones that he knows he\u2019ll be viewed as a pervert and a peeping Tom for his activities: \u201cI\u2019m prepared for that,\u201d he says defiantly. But he didn\u2019t want to die without sharing his \u201cfindings.\u201d Ostensibly, Foos was invading his customers\u2019 privacy in the name of social research, methodically documenting their activities and proclivities to gain a comprehensive understanding of an evolving, Vietnam-era America. He had grandiose notions of functioning as an all-knowing, all-seeing Godlike figure, albeit for the greater good. Mostly, though, he wanted to watch people getting it on. Talese, the famed author of the groundbreaking 1980 book about sex in America, \u201cThy Neighbor\u2019s Wife,\u201d was understandably fascinated (and a little disturbed) when Foos contacted him to tell his story and share his journals. \u201cI\u2019m a voyeur myself,\u201d Talese says in explaining why he was a natural to tell Foos\u2019 story. And that\u2019s exactly what he did in the April 11, 2016, issue of\u00a0New Yorker magazine as a precursor to the release of a non-fiction book on the subject, \u201cThe Voyeur\u2019s Motel,\u201d three months later. But something happened during those three months that changed everything. You may have heard or read about the credibility questions that arose after the New Yorker piece came out, ones Talese himself acknowledged high up in the lengthy article: \u201cCould such a man be a reliable source?\u201d he wondered, given that he was the lone voice and his claims were outrageous. In that case, the film\u2019s broad strokes won\u2019t come as a complete surprise. Whether or not you\u2019re familiar with this story, though, \u201cVoyeur\u201d takes us on a roller coaster ride of deviant behavior and delicate egos, as two men who\u2019d forged an unexpected and intimate bond suddenly find themselves questioning each other over the nature of the truth. Advertisement The term \u201cFake News\u201d gets bandied about a lot these days\u2014mostly by the President of the United States, unfortunately. But \u201cVoyeur\u201d explores the lengths to which seasoned reporters can go to get a tough story right and still end up being duped, as well as the ethical and emotional entanglements that can spring from investigative journalism. The documentary is fascinating in an admittedly prurient way for the first half or so, then shifts and becomes compelling in an even larger, more relevant context. And as it does, it exposes the extreme elements of both men\u2019s personalities. As the narrative morphs, it also calls to mind the 2007 documentary \u201cMy Kid Could Paint That,\u201d in which director Amir Bar-Lev investigated the paintings of a four-year-old girl whose work was being compared to Picasso and ended up becoming part of the story itself the deeper he questioned its truth. Lines get blurred when you spend so much time with a subject\u2014and by nature, the filmmakers themselves are voyeurs, too. \u201cVoyeur\u201d gains momentum as Kane and Koury cross-cut between the two men in the days leading up to the book\u2019s release, with Joel Goodman\u2019s score adding to the tension. We see Talese standing proudly before his tailor, being fitted for the bespoke suit he\u2019ll wear to promote \"The Voyeur\u2019s Motel\u201d on \u201cLate Night With Seth Myers.\u201d Meanwhile Foos has lost his swagger altogether\u2014except for the occasional rant\u2014and holes up with his quietly supportive wife, Anita, in their side-by-side recliners. (The scene in which he delivers a rapid-fire screed while slowly descending the stairs in a mechanical chair is darkly funny and deeply sad at once.) When the directors allow the natural drama of this relationship to play out\u2014and when they let us simmer in the inherent ickiness of it all and decide for ourselves how we feel about it\u2014\u201cVoyeur\u201d feels bracingly relevant. At a time when we all share every mundane detail of our daily lives online and every Google search and Amazon purchase we make follows us for all of eternity, there is no such thing as privacy anymore. But too often, Kane and Koury don\u2019t seem to trust entirely what they have, and they needlessly pad \u201cVoyeur\u201d with miniatures, re-enactments and an overall light, playful tone. It all seems at odds with the story\u2019s fundamentally disturbing\u2014yet gripping\u2014content. Talese and Foos are both in their mid-80s now, and as Talese put it, Foos will probably earn an obituary in the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0someday\u00a0for his bizarre place in pop culture. No doubt, it will be meticulously fact-checked. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Atonement", "Review": "\"Atonement\" begins on joyous gossamer wings, and descends into an abyss of tragedy and loss. Its opening scenes in an English country house between the wars are like a dream of elegance, and then a 13-year-old girl sees something she misunderstands, tells a lie and destroys all possibility of happiness in three lives, including her own. The movie's opening act is like a breathless celebration of pure heedless joy, a demonstration of the theory that the pinnacle of human happiness was reached by life in an English country house between the wars. Of course that was more true of those upstairs than downstairs. We meet Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley), the bold, older daughter of an old family, and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), their housekeeper's promising son, who is an Oxford graduate, thanks to the generosity of Cecilia's father. Despite their difference in social class, they are powerfully attracted to each other, and that leads to a charged erotic episode next to a fountain on the house lawn. Advertisement This meeting is seen from an upstairs window by Cecilia's younger sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), who thinks she sees Robbie mistreating her sister in his idea of rude sex play. We see the same scene later from Robbie and Cecilia's point of view, and realize it involves their first expression of mutual love. But Briony does not understand, has a crush on Robbie herself, and as she reads an intercepted letter and interrupts a private tryst, her resentment grows until she tells the lie that will send Robbie out of Cecilia's reach. Oh, but the earlier scenes have floated effortlessly. Cecilia, as played by Knightley with stunning style, speaks rapidly in that upper-class accent that sounds like performance art. When I hear it, I despair that we Americans will ever approach such style with our words, which march out like baked potatoes. She is so beautiful, so graceful, so young, and Robbie may be working as a groundsman but is true blue, intelligent and in love with her. They deserve each other. But that is not to be, as you know if you have read the Ian McEwan best seller that the movie is inspired so faithfully by. McEwan, one of the best novelists alive, allows the results of Briony's vindictive behavior to grow offstage until we meet the principals again in the early days of the war. Robbie has enlisted and been posted to France. Cecilia is a nurse in London, and so is Briony, now 18, trying to atone for what she realizes was a tragic error. There is a meeting of the three, only once, in London, that demonstrates to them what they have all lost. The film cuts back and forth between the war in France and the bombing of London, and there is a single (apparently) unbroken shot of the beach at Dunkirk that is one of the great takes in film history, achieved or augmented with CGI though it is. (If it looks real, in movie logic, it is real.) After an agonizing trek from behind enemy lines, Robbie is among the troops waiting to be evacuated, in a Dunkirk much more of a bloody mess than legend would have us believe. In the months before, the lovers have written, promising each other the happiness they have earned. Advertisement Each period and scene in the movie is compelling on its own terms, and then compelling on a deeper level as a playing out of the destiny that was sealed beside the fountain on that perfect summer's day. It is only at the end of the film, when Briony, now an aged novelist played by Vanessa Redgrave, reveals facts about the story that we realize how thoroughly, how stupidly, she has continued for a lifetime to betray Cecilia, Robbie and herself. The structure of the McEwan novel and this film directed by Joe Wright is relentless. How many films have we seen that fascinate in every moment and then, in the last moments, pose a question about all that has gone before, one that forces us to think deeply about what betrayal and atonement might really entail? Wright, who also directed Knightley in his first film, \"Pride and Prejudice,\" (2005) shows a mastery of nuance and epic, sometimes in adjacent scenes. In the McEwan novel, he has a story that can hardly fail him and an ending that blindsides us with its implications. This is one of the year's best films, a certain best picture nominee."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Lovely Bones", "Review": "\"The Lovely Bones\" is a deplorable film with this message: If you're a 14-year-old girl who has been brutally raped and murdered by a serial killer, you have a lot to look forward to. You can get together in heaven with the other teenage victims of the same killer, and gaze down in benevolence upon your family members as they mourn you and realize what a wonderful person you were. Sure, you miss your friends, but your fellow fatalities come dancing to greet you in a meadow of wildflowers, and how cool is that? Advertisement The makers of this film seem to have given slight thought to the psychology of teenage girls, less to the possibility that there is no heaven, and none at all to the likelihood that if there is one, it will not resemble a happy gathering of new Facebook friends. In its version of the events, the serial killer can almost be seen as a hero for liberating these girls from the tiresome ordeal of growing up and dispatching them directly to the Elysian Fields. The film's primary effect was to make me squirmy. It's based on the best-seller by Alice Sebold that everybody seemed to be reading a couple of years ago. I hope it's not faithful to the book; if it is, millions of Americans are scary. The murder of a young person is a tragedy, the murderer is a monster, and making the victim a sweet, poetic narrator is creepy. This movie sells the philosophy that even evil things are God's will, and their victims are happier now. Isn't it nice to think so. I think it's best if they don't happen at all. But if they do, why pretend they don't hurt? Those girls are dead. I'm assured, however, that Sebold's novel is well-written and sensitive. I presume the director, Peter Jackson, has distorted elements to fit his own \"vision,\" which involves nearly as many special effects in some sequences as his \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. A more useful way to deal with this material would be with observant, subtle performances in a thoughtful screenplay. It's not a feel-good story. Perhaps Jackson's team made the mistake of fearing the novel was too dark. But its millions of readers must know it's not like this. The target audience might be doom-besotted teenage girls -- the \"Twilight\" crowd. Advertisement The owner of the lovely bones is named Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan, a very good young actress, who cannot be faulted here). The heaven Susie occupies looks a little like a Flower Power world in the kind of fantasy that, murdered in 1973, she might have imagined. Seems to me that heaven, by definition outside time and space, would have neither colors nor a lack of colors -- would be a state with no sensations. Nor would there be thinking there, let alone narration. In an eternity spent in the presence of infinite goodness, you don't go around thinking, \"Man! Is this great!\" You simply are. I have a lot of theologians on my side here. But no. From her movie-set Valhalla, Susie gazes down as her mother (Rachel Weisz) grieves and her father (Mark Wahlberg) tries to solve the case himself. There's not much of a case to solve; we know who the killer is almost from the get-go, and, under the Law of Economy of Characters that's who he has to be, because (a) he's played by an otherwise unnecessary movie star, and (b) there's no one else in the movie it could be. Here's something bittersweet. Weisz and Wahlberg are effective as the parents. Because the pyrotechnics are mostly upstairs with the special effects, all they need to be are convincing parents who have lost their daughter. This they do with touching subtlety. We also meet one of Susie's grandmothers (Susan Sarandon), an unwise drinker who comes on to provide hard-boiled comic relief, in the Shakespearean tradition that every tragedy needs its clown. Well, she's good, too. This whole film is Jackson's fault. It doesn't fail simply because I suspect its message. It fails on its own terms. It isn't emotionally convincing that this girl, having had these experiences and destined apparently to be 14 forever (although cleaned up and with a new wardrobe), would produce this heavenly creature. What's left for us to pity? We should all end up like her, and the sooner the better; preferably not after being raped and murdered."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Lakeview Terrace", "Review": "Neil LaBute's \"Lakeview Terrace\" is a film about a black cop who makes life hell for an interracial couple who move in next door. It will inspire strong reactions among its viewers, including outrage. It is intended to. LaBute often creates painful situations that challenge a character's sense of decency. This time he does it within the structure of a thriller, but the questions are there all the same. For example, the neighbor, Abel Turner, is a bitter racist. He has his reasons, but don't we all. It is one mark of a sociopath to try to cure his wounds by harming others. The decent person does not visit his obsessions and prejudices upon his neighbor, but is enjoined to love him as he does himself. Since Turner (Samuel L. Jackson) may hate himself, of course that is a problem. Advertisement But take a step back. What if all the races were switched? If the neighbor were white, the husband next door black, his wife white? Same script. It would be the story of a sociopathic white racist. It might be interesting, but it would have trouble getting made. The casting of Jackson as the neighbor creates a presumption of innocence that some will hold on to longer than the story justifies. Don't think for a moment that LaBute doesn't know audience members will be thinking about that switch of identities. He wants us to. All of his films feature nasty people who challenge nasty thoughts or fears within ourselves. Is this movie racist for making the villain black or would it be equally racist by making the villain white? Well? What's your answer? Jackson, a Los Angeles police veteran, lives on Lakeview Terrace, a crescent of comfortable suburbia in the hills of the city. The lots are pie-shaped, so the houses are placed close together, but the lots open out into big backyards. Into the house next door, newcomers arrive: Chris Mattson (Patrick Wilson) and his wife, Lisa (Kerry Washington). They seem fairly recently married, happy. Turner starts slowly, dropping some subtly hostile remarks, and then escalates his war on this couple. I will not describe his words and actions, except to say he pushes buttons that make the Mattsons first outraged, then fearful, then angry -- at him, and each other. Take another step back. Mattson's father-in-law, a successful attorney, is ... cool and civil toward his daughter's white husband. Mattson's own\u00a0parents, his wife observes, \"are always making a point of telling me how much they love me.\" Why make that a special point? Because they do, or because they don't? What do you think? Lisa's father asks Chris point-blank: \"Are you planning to have children with my daughter?\" Is he eager to become a grandfather? Doesn't sound like it. Well, are they having kids? Lisa wants to get pregnant right now. Chris says, \"We have an agreement to wait awhile.\" Why wait awhile? Because that makes sense while they're getting their feet on the ground? Or because he's ambivalent about his wife? You decide. Even if waiting does \"make sense,\" are his feelings worthy of their marriage? Even while making a superb thriller, LaBute makes the film more than that. It deals with one of his themes, the difficult transition from prolonged adolescence to manhood, a journey Chris takes in the film. It is not easy. Many of the steps are contrary to his nature. Advertisement LaBute ingeniously poses moral choices in all of his films. In his first great movie, \"In the Company of Men,\" about a cruel office worker who plays a trick on a deaf woman, does the villain gain more pleasure by hurting her or forcing his passive male co-worker to act against his own better nature? Both? Why does the co-worker go along? Timidity? Buried aggression? Homoerotic feelings for his buddy? See? On top of all these questions, LaBute constructs a tightly wound story that also involves crude male bonding at an LAPD bachelor party, sexual humiliation, attempted rape (not by Chris or Abel), a cat-and-mouse game with cell phones and a violent conclusion during which we must decide if Chris is right about Abel, or wrong, or just discovering how to push his buttons. I'm surprised by the PG-13 rating. It's a challenging journey LaBute takes us on. Some will find it exciting. Some will find it an opportunity for an examination of conscience. Some will leave feeling vaguely uneasy. Some won't like it and will be absolutely sure why they don't, but their reasons will not agree. Some will hate elements that others can't even see. Some will only see a thriller. I find movies like this alive and provoking, and I'm exhilarated to have my thinking challenged at every step of the way. The effect is only intensified by the performances, especially by Jackson, who for such a nice man can certainly play vicious. Kerry Washington's character, in my mind, takes the moral high ground, although it's a little muddy. Her beauty and vulnerability are called for. Patrick Wilson plays a well-meaning man who is challenged to his core, and never thought that would happen. I think I know who is good and bad or strong and weak in this film. But here's the brilliance of it: I don't know if they do. Note: Lake View Terrace is the name of the neighborhood where Rodney King was arrested and beaten. This film mentions King and uses the name of the area but not the location."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Divine Order", "Review": "It is perhaps no accident that the heroine of this story of women\u2019s liberation in early 1970\u2019s Switzerland is named Nora. The legendary proto-feminist heroine of Ibsen\u2019s 19th-century drama walked out of her doll\u2019s house about 100 years before the Nora of this movie walks out on her husband, two sons, and borderline abusive father in law.\u00a0 The Nora of this film, written and directed by Petra Volpe, doesn\u2019t seem likely to leave forever. Despite the elevation of consciousness that takes place throughout this movie, her bond to her husband Hans and her two kids is strong. The most pleasurable part of watching this Nora\u2019s story is seeing how the males in her life have to make room for her, and do some learning themselves.\u00a0 Advertisement The movie opens with a montage of social unrest from late \u201860s America. Interesting to think that this country was importing socially conscious rebellion fifty years ago, huh? A female narrator\u2019s voice (Nora\u2019s, we\u2019ll later figure out) tells of how thrilling it was to hear of such phenomena as Woodstock, and then observes that life in a rural Swiss village was a little dull by comparison. Livening things up was a referendum to allow women the right to vote.\u00a0 Played with confidence and understatement by Marie Leuenberger, Nora at first seems a relatively obedient, complaisant if not complacent housewife. She and her matinee-idol handsome husband Hans are often apt to visit the farm on which Hans\u2019s brother Werner, who\u2019s married to Nora\u2019s older sister Therese, is failing to thrive, much to the consternation of the aforementioned nasty father-in-law, who constantly lectures the family on its shortcomings, expresses his general disgust with the womenfolk therein, and keeps sex tabloids under his bed\u2019s pillow. Nora reveals herself as an unusually tolerant and good-hearted family member by earning the trust of Therese\u2019s rebellious teen daughter Hanna, who promptly betrays that trust by running off to Zurich with a ne\u2019er-do-well boyfriend on a trip to town with Nora. It\u2019s during that trip to town that Nora gets her first taste of feminism: some women handing out pamphlets on the vote referendum practically weigh Nora down with feminist literature, including a German translation of a vital Betty Friedan book. Hans is away for compulsory military training, so she reads her new stuff as well as a copy of Switzerland\u2019s marriage act, just to make sure Hans is telling the truth when he insists that she can\u2019t get a part-time job without his explicit permission.\u00a0 An admission of disagreement with her town\u2019s resident Phyllis Schlafly-like anti-feminist attracts the notice of an older woman, Vroni, who says that she was the only woman in town to support suffrage last time it was on the ballot in Switzerland, in 1959. The two women venture to a defunct pub that Vroni lost after her husband\u2019s death, and discover an Italian immigrant, Graziella, preparing to transform the joint into a pizzeria.\u00a0 The younger women get new hairstyles and go on a shopping spree. Soon more join them, and they\u2019re running off to Zurich to march in demonstrations and sit in on a talk from a female sex guru who talks about honoring one\u2019s own vagina and dropping the knowledge to Nora that she has a tiger between her legs. When Hans gets home, he meets a very different wife.\u00a0 He is not entirely pleased. And neither are the rest of the town\u2019s men, becoming even more agitated when a large group of women go on strike, holing up in Graziella\u2019s place and refusing to do housework until the vote is taken.\u00a0 This is a conventional but exceptionally warm crowd-pleaser of a movie, mostly thanks to Leuenberger\u2019s performance. Her Nora is a shyer creature than many groundbreaking feminists of cinema, but Leuenberger makes this personality trait feel genuine, a real part of her character rather than a sop to make her rebellion more palatable to male viewers. Her desire to keep her family together persists even in her reasonable demands that she be accommodated as an actual, contributing, equal component of it. She\u2019s definitely a performer to watch.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Ktown Cowboys", "Review": "Adapted from the popular YouTube series that dates back to 2010, \u201cKtown Cowboys\u201d follows a quintet of Korean-American men as they ride through raucous Los Angeles day and night, offering a first-person perspective into different facets of Koreatown life by using filmmaking tricks \u00e0 la \u201cThe Big Short\u201d (quick cuts and fourth-wall breaks).\u00a0Executive produced by (and featuring a cameo from) Ken Jeong, the project proves to have limits to its comedic imagination, offering some refreshing sweetness most of all in its portrayal of extremely macho friendship.\u00a0 Advertisement With established characters to work from, the hard-partying men of \u201cKtown Cowboys\u201d are more than one-dimensional archetypes, even if their life dramas feel headed towards clich\u00e9. For example, lead focus and rich kid Jason (Shane Yoon) is dealing with legal troubles at work, while having a life passion to open a club. Experiencing similar stress is Robby (Bobby Choy), who was adopted by white parents (played by Eric Roberts and Rhonda Alrdich) and is wrestling with the idea of leaving behind his job to learn more about his heritage in Korea. Meanwhile, Peter (Peter Jae) brings some comic relief as a lovable lug and fashion designer, while co-writer Danny Cho gets the smallest arc, appearing in a couple of funny stand-up moments as hustling comedian Danny.\u00a0The most emotionally successful story might belong to Sunny (Sunn Wee), who has to with take care of his father who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s, while inheriting the family liquor store.\u00a0 With impressively concise storytelling from debut director Daniel Park, we know more than just their jobs and ambitions, and become connected to these characters as their mini-arcs are tied together. Park coats the big heart he has for these people with warm LA lens flares, and finds energy from sharp cuts and wall-to-wall music. It\u2019s the performances that prove to be spotty, with flat line-readings all around and displays of emotions that struggle to reach from the script to the audience.\u00a0 With its YouTube series origins in mind, \u201cKtown Cowboys\u201d falls in line with two other shows about young men of urban nightlife, its flaws revealed by certain similarities. Like Aziz Ansari\u2019s Netflix series \u201cMaster of None,\u201d Park\u2019s film offers a personal experience of being at tough junctures of maturity, while dealing with parts of heritage (without characters being defined strictly by ethnicity). But while Ansari\u2019s show manages to find revelations in common experience, \u201cKtown Cowboys\u201d often lacks an original voice or the wit for which it\u2019s aiming, especially regarding musings on friendship and identity.\u00a0 The lack of comedic imagination (especially when restricted by a small budget) in \u201cKtown Cowboys\u201d often leads to stale situations about sexual extremes, genitalia or even gay panic. In contrast, the funniest moments come from downplayed jabs they lob at each other, like when Danny tells an overly anxious Peter about Sunny, \u201cDude, he\u2019s going to Korea, not war, dumbass.\u201d It\u2019s a throwaway line that speaks to the honesty within the crew\u2019s chemistry, topping that weary \u201cEntourage\u201d influence with characters who are immediately more likable.\u00a0 Advertisement From the show's pilot, \u201cKtown Cowboys\u201d has been designed to focus on, and be inclusive about, the different terms within Ktown life; it\u2019s a shame that zippy presentations of concepts like \u201cbooking\u201d (it's like speed-dating) or even \u201cFOB\u201d (\u201cfresh off the boat\u201d) use the film's male-focus to limit gestures of diversity. Aside from lacking any non-nagging Korean-American woman of the same age, \u201cKtown Cowboys\u201d makes us aware of antiquated enterprises like \u201cdohmis,\u201d women who are paid to hang out and flirt during karaoke sessions, but as Danny insists while breaking the fourth wall, are not prostitutes. \u201cThey\u2019re like modern-day geishas,\u201d he reasons. \u201cAnd usually, no sex is involved \u2026 unless you got game.\u201d \u201cKtown Cowboys\u201d disappointingly doesn\u2019t challenge or question these notions, exposing a condescending conservative side in order to cater a hit-and-miss guy\u2019s night out."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Everybody Wants Some!!", "Review": "All kinds of possibilities open up when a director keeps things loose. Looseness can result in unformed, repetitive, or boring storytelling. Richard Linklater's looseness operates differently. Relationships are the most important thing to him, how people connect, or don't. Linklater is obsessed with the peripheral, the seemingly unimportant or random. People in real life rarely stop dead in their tracks to have a profound moment, and they don't in his films either. When Linklater's style works (and it works in \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"), there is nobody quite like him.\u00a0 Advertisement Linklater has described \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to his 1993 high-school comedy \"Dazed and Confused.\" \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" takes place in 1980, tracking the lives of a group of college baseball players in the three days before classes start. There are two \"baseball houses,\" rambling affairs on the outskirts of campus where the baseball team settles in to a routine of partying, philosophizing, and competition. Dancing, romance, conversation\u2014all become battles for dominance. The guys peacock for one another more than for the girls who show up at their parties. When the boys get dressed to go out to a club, their preening is reminiscent of John Travolta staring at himself in the mirror in \"Saturday\u00a0Night Fever.\" These guys are dudes, with the satisfied glow of successful athletes. They move with a collective strut, a swagger. They have spent their childhoods with one organizing purpose: baseball. And this sets them apart from their peers (whom they regard as slackers). None of them (except one who refers to himself as \"the second Nolan Ryan\") have dreams of going pro. College is an opportunity to get four more years doing what they love most before \"real life\" starts. All of this could be deadly if handled poorly. Who wants to see a bunch of jocks competing to win in every moment of every day? (Well, I do, but I assume that is not true for everyone.) Linklater keeps it loose, funny, relishing in the free-form of the group dynamic. A ping pong match turns on a dime and becomes deadly serious. Guys knuckle-flick each other until they draw blood. They try to slice a baseball in half with an axe as it comes across the plate. They compete to see who can inhale the biggest bong hit. Even jumping into a river becomes a display of who does it best. Linklater approaches all of this with affection, and even kindness\u2014one of his distinguishing characteristics. \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a corrective to the tired, false \"dumb jock\" stereotype. Jake (Blake Jenner) is a freshman pitcher, entering one of the baseball houses on his first day of school, holding his milk crate full of albums (Devo's Are We Not Men visible), and confronted with the initial hostility of the mustachioed intimidating upper classmen. They aren't hostile because he's a freshman. They're hostile because he's a pitcher. (\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is insightful and funny about inter-position conflicts in baseball. An older pitcher encourages Jake to accept his outsider status: \"Embrace your inner strange.\") Jake meets the ragtag bunch of guys in various states of chaos: smoking weed, filling up a waterbed, practicing a pitching wind-up buck-naked, etc. After a stern speech from the coach reminding them of the house rules (no alcohol, no girls upstairs in bedrooms), the group promptly breaks all of them, simultaneously, almost before the coach leaves the house. Advertisement Over the course of the three days, the guys attend four separate parties. The film presents a good cross-section of the culture in 1980: disco is still popular, country-western is coming back, and the slam-dancing sub-culture of punk is on the rise. (Humorously, one of the parties they attend is thrown by the theatre department at the college, proving that theatre kids are the same in any era.) In some environments, the jocks are cock of the walk. In others, they are out of their depth. But girl-hunting is girl-hunting whether she sports a Mohawk or a cowboy hat. Jake crushes on a sweet theatre major (Zoey Deutch). They have nothing in common except for the important fact that have both lived their short lives focused on a passion requiring seriousness and discipline. They are the opposite of \"slackers.\" Their romance is just one part of the overall texture of the film. Some of the cast members are recognizable actors, although there are no big stars in it. Some of the guys have no acting experience. It's a great mix. The group is a shifting mass of alliances, hostility-outbreaks, and a sense of togetherness-by-default deriving from the fact that they are a championship ball team. I was surprised at how strangely thrilling it was to finally get to see them play baseball at their first practice. All the guys do throughout the film is talk about baseball, even pre- and post-coitus, and when we see them in action it's deeply satisfying and emblematic of one of the ways in which Linklater works by stealth. Linklater's style isn't invisible, although he approaches moments with a casual lightness of touch. Some of his cuts are laugh-out-loud funny. (My favorite cut in a Linklater film cuts comes in \"Bernie,\" after Jack Black shoots Shirley MacLaine, and wails, \"What am I going to do?\") The film has an easy rhythm. Moments aren't lingered over. Hilarious details go unmentioned (the fact that they all go back to the house to change clothes, depending on the next party in the lineup.) Some of the commentary from the guys states the obvious too much, i.e.: \"Have you noticed that everything we do is a competition?\", but for the most part, Linklater's script avoids self-awareness that would pull you out of it. In 1980, there were still hostages in Iran. Jimmy Carter was President (but not for long). 1980 was closer to the '70s than the slick yuppie-MTV era coming down the pike, and Linklater's frequent production designer Bruce Curtis gets that distinction. (So do Gabriella Villarreal on set decoration and costume designer Kari Perkins.) There are gas guzzling cars, silk shirts with pointed collars, girls in halter tops. The soundtrack ranges from Blondie to Foreigner. The film captures an elusive in-between moment in time the second before it vanishes.\u00a0 Advertisement Nostalgia is at its worst when the story being told is suffused in a golden glow, that glow assuming (wrongly) that the nostalgia portrayed is universal. People are nostalgic for different things. What Laura Ingalls Wilder was nostalgic for was not what F. Scott Fitzgerald was nostalgic for, although both wrote mainly from nostalgia. There's nostalgia that becomes kitsch, the objects/fashion/music of the past coming around to be \"cool\" again. There's nostalgia that is interchangeable with longing and sadness. There's nostalgia that is anti-progress. Despite the \"everybody\" in the title, Linklater's nostalgia is specific to the sounds and smells and sights of the time in which he grew up, in which his personality was formed. Crucially, he doesn't laugh at these younger selves, although he often finds them extremely funny. \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" doesn't fall into the trap that a lot of period films do where the audience is encouraged to consider themselves superior to the folks \"back then.\" Linklater cuts us off at the pass when we may be inclined to snicker. He's not afraid of including sincerity. \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" features two girls mud-wrestling in their underwear and it also shows a quiet romantic moment near a river at dawn. Neither scene jars or upsets the balance. With all the rough-housing, it's an extremely gentle film.\u00a0 Linklater's best films are high-wire acts. Not to be tried by amateurs."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Burning Plain", "Review": "\"The Burning Plain\u201d involves events perhaps 20 years and 1,000 miles apart, with many of the same characters. Told chronologically, it might have accumulated considerable power. Told as a labyrinthine tangle of intercut timelines and locations, it is a frustrating exercise in self-indulgence by writer-director Guillermo Arriaga. He is familiar with intercut storylines. Teaming with Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, he wrote \u201cAmores Perros,\u201d \u201cBabel\u201d and \u201c21 Grams,\u201d three splendid films that moved among people and places. They were all different characters, and it was clear where everything was happening. That made it easier. And the human drama in each place had continuity and integrity; the story strands might even have been reassembled as self-contained short films. Advertisement In \u201cThe Burning Plain,\u201d his first feature film as a director, Arriaga should have asked harder questions of his screenwriter, himself. I don't know if it's a spoiler or just merciful assistance to tell you that many of the characters we see are the same people at different times in their lives, and that some of the men at different ages are hard to tell apart. Certainly a time comes when you figure that out for yourself \u2014 before, I hope, the movie belatedly relents and makes it clear. Given the Law of Economy of Characters, you eventually realize that there would be no need for separate stories apparently destined never to meet. You can see there are two main locations \u2014 New Mexico and Oregon \u2014 and you decide that years must have passed, although the visual cues (cars, clothes) don't provide clues. What is Arriaga's purpose in this construction? Search me. He's being too clever for his own good. That's a shame, because his actors provide him with effective performances, even though they must emotionally build up or refer back to the same characters played by different actors. Having possibly diminished your experience (or maybe enhanced it) by tipping off the two time periods, I will deliberately avoid additional details and simply describe the characters we meet. In New Mexico, Gina (Kim Basinger) is a married woman, passionately in love with Nick (Joaquim de Almeida), a man not her husband. They live in separate towns, and he places a house trailer midway so they can meet. This mobile home is far isolated enough that traffic never passes it, and close enough that Mariana (Jennifer Lawrence), Gina's teenage daughter, can reach it by bicycle. Coincidentally, Mariana meets Santiago (J.D. Pardo), Nick's son. These coincidences have a way of happening in Arriaga's screenplays. In Oregon, Sylvia (Charlize Theron) manages a chic seaside restaurant and is deeply unhappy. She has quick, meaningless sex with seemingly almost any man, and has a way of leaving her job at key hours and smoking morosely above the waves. A mysterious man named Carlos (Jose Maria Yazpik) follows her and insists they must meet. Perhaps he desires sex? No, it is more complicated. And that's all I'll say. Basinger and Theron have the key roles and are excellent, although by the nature of the story construction, their characters are denied continuity, and that's something leading characters usually require. Theron, who is one of the film's producers, is intelligent and daring in her choice of roles, and must have trusted that the author of those three great screenplays and also of \u201cThe Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,\u201d would know how to negotiate this tangle. Unfortunately, he doesn't. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Amanda Knox", "Review": "Netflix\u2019s \u201cAmanda Knox\u201d opens with a gut check statement\r\nabout this case that I hadn\u2019t really considered. There are many reasons that this\r\nnow-almost-decade-old case entranced the world, but chief among them may be\r\nwhat Knox says herself at the open of the film: \u201cEither I\u2019m a psychopath in\r\nsheep\u2019s clothing or I am YOU.\u201d Either this seemingly sweet, na\u00efve girl is\r\nactually a total sociopath\u2014someone who tortured and killed her roommate for fun\u2014or\r\nthis seemingly sweet, na\u00efve girl was accused of something she didn\u2019t do, which\r\nmeans this could happen to anyone. Either situation is terrifying. \u201cAmanda Knox\u201d\r\ndoes an admirable job of detailing the crucial facts of the case. I don\u2019t\r\nsuspect it will persuade anyone convinced that Knox is akin to the Monster of\r\nFlorence, and it undeniably takes a pro-Knox stance, but it\u2019s a well-made,\r\naccomplished piece of filmmaking that works because of how it focuses such a\r\nlarge case down to its key players, thereby illuminating how something like\r\nthis could happen to anyone. Advertisement In November of 2007, Amanda Knox was living in Perugia,\r\nItaly with her British roommate Meredith Kercher. She claimed that she came\r\nhome after spending the night with her boyfriend Rafael Sollecito to find a\r\nbloodbath. The window was broken and Kercher\u2019s throat had been cut. There was\r\nblood everywhere and there were even feces in the toilet. A year later, Rudy\r\nGuede was convicted of murdering Kercher\u2014the feces belonged to him and his DNA\r\nwas all over the scene. And yet the local cops never gave up their theory that Knox\r\nand maybe Sollecito were also involved. Why? Well, first there\u2019s the way Knox behaved the day the\r\nbody was found. She came home and showered before she found Kercher\u2019s body\u2014which\r\nthe police found odd. And she was caught by cameras kissing Sollecito while the\r\npolice were handling the scene. She didn\u2019t seem to be handling the discovery \u201cnormally,\u201d\r\nas if that\u2019s an easy thing to define for a 20-year-old girl in a foreign\r\ncountry. The next day, when she was brought back to the scene by prosecutor Giuliano\r\nMignini, who is introduced in the film comparing himself to Sherlock Holmes in\r\ncase you need to know about his ego, Knox had something of a breakdown,\r\nsmacking her ears and screaming. Mignini became convinced she was remembering\r\nkilling Kercher. The Italian cops interrogated and allegedly abused Knox until\r\nshe confessed.  Amanda Knox tells horrifying stories of her treatment by the\r\nItalian police, including being slapped in the head by them and told she had\r\nHIV. And if that abusive invasion of privacy wasn\u2019t enough, the media jumped\r\ninto the same pool, personified in the film by Daily Mail journalist Nick Pisa,\r\na morally dubious fellow who admits to being given Knox\u2019s prison diary and\r\npublishing passages from it and then speaks of \u201cjournalistic principles\u201d when\r\nasked how he got it. The media industry turned Knox\u2019s sexuality into a weapon\u2014she\r\nwas scolded for her supposed immorality and that was used as the basis for the prosecution's version of the crime. And the number of half-truths and lies printed by people like Pisa is\r\nstaggering. At one point, he says \u201cIt\u2019s not like I could double check\u201d because\r\nthat means someone else would run the story first. He still sees Knox as a \"story\" instead of a human being. Advertisement There was almost no trace of Knox\u2019s DNA in any\r\nessential part of this case\u2014and the DNA that did convict her at one point was\r\nlater deemed inconsequential or contaminated\u2014and Guede\u2019s DNA was all over the scene.\r\nSo you have to believe that she cleaned up the scene perfectly but not her\r\nco-killer\u2019s feces in the toilet or she committed the crime in a hazmat suit.\r\nAnd yet people like Mignini consistently dismiss these kind of factual questions\r\nwith comments about what they could tell by looking in Knox\u2019s eyes. He even\r\ncalls himself a prophet in his own country after the first conviction. This\r\nwasn\u2019t a story of justice or murder. It was a story of men who saw a way to use\r\na girl to further their own careers, as prosecutors and journalists. Again, if you think Amanda Knox is a masterful criminal,\r\nsomeone who got away with murder, this film is unlikely to convince you\r\notherwise. Most of this information has been available before\u2014although some of\r\nthe first-hand accounts of the interrogations from Knox and Sollecito are new.\r\nIt\u2019s just seeing it all presented in one, impactful film that one can view the\r\nscope of the whole story. Whether you think she did it or not, \u201cAmanda Knox\u201d is\r\na horror story that should be told."}
{"Stars": 0.0, "Title": "Oscar shorts: Live action", "Review": "Shorts International presents the five live action short films selected as this year's Oscar nominees: \"Asad,\" \"Buzkashi Boys,\" \"Curfew,\" \"Death of a Shadow,\" \"Henry.\" Running time: 113 minutes total. MPAA rating: Not rated (suitable for all-ages viewing). \tThe first thing you may wonder about this year's Academy Award nominees for best live-action short is: Where's the Funny? Academy voters typically favor drama over comedy in the Best Picture category, and that bias prevails in the shorts category, too. Last year's winner was Terry George's somber Irish drama \"The Shore,\" but I would've preferred the whimsical, slyly understated humor of the Norwegian nominee \"Tuba Atlantic,\" or the more conventional Irish charms of \"Pentecost,\" about a young altar boy who mischievously disrupts a Sunday service in his local parish. Advertisement Aside from one nominee (\"Curfew\") that tries to be amusing, this year's batch of five nominees emphasize what Woody Allen (in \"Annie Hall\") called \"total heaviosity,\" which is to say: Don't look for laughs because they're in very short supply.\r\nThat's more of an observation than a criticism, however, because all five live-action nominees share another trait: They may be short on humor, but they compassionately illuminate the state of our world, our frailties and foibles, and our capacity to survive the challenges that life throws at our feet.\r\nThat quality of endurance shines brightly in this year's strongest nominee, the Afghanistan drama \"Buzkashi Boys\" (29:42), an international collaboration (director Sam French is American) and one of the first narrative films shot amidst the war-torn ruins of Kabul. It's here that we find two young boys \u2014 a streetwise orphan and the son of a stern but loving blacksmith \u2014 who both dream of playing Buzkashi, an Afghani variant of polo using a dead goat (and the source, presumably, of the phrase \"he got your goat\"). It's a rugged sport that would likely appeal to children of war, and despite a tragic turn of events, the film emerges as a muted celebration of tenacity and hope for better days to come. Like Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment's 1952 classic \"Forbidden Games,\" French's film views war and its aftermath through the eyes of children \u2014 still, and always, the most heartbreaking perspective on humanity's dark side. That the film ends with a hint of optimism is no small achievement. Similarly, the U.S./South African coproduction \"Asad\" (16:28) effectively uses a cast of Somali refugees, offering a child's-eye view of what initially appears to be a no-win scenario: In a small, war-torn Somali fishing village, a young boy Asad (Haroun Mohammed \u2014 like the kids in \"Buzkashi Boys\" a superb nonprofessional actor) faces a high-pressure choice between the dangers of ship-raiding or, in defiance of the heavily armed village pirates, the honest life of a traditional village fisherman. It's been said that children are often wiser than the grown-ups around them; \"Asad\" embraces that sentiment with no-nonsense practicality. A Belgium/France coproduction, \"Death of a Shadow\" (20:29) is a dark fantasy that looks and feels like a Steampunk collaboration between Terry Gilliam, David Fincher and Jean-Pierre Jeunet in \"City Of Lost Children\" mode. In the wake of World War I, a photographer with a strange, supernatural camera captures the shadow of dead soldier named Nathan (Matthias Schoenaerts, from \"Rust and Bone\"), and offers him a second life in exchange for 10,000 shadows. Seizing the opportunity, Nathan sets out to find Sarah (Laura Verlinden), the woman he'd fallen in love with before he was killed in battle. When he discovers that she's now with another man, jealousy drives him to pursue an embittered course of action. With bizarrely imaginative production values that will appeal to fans of Guillermo del Toro, \"Death of a Shadow\" seems a bit muddled in terms of storytelling and overall purpose, but if director Tom Van Avermaet has steampunk feature in his future, it's guaranteed to be a visual feast of retro design. Advertisement Like the acclaimed 2001 drama \"Iris\" and Sarah Polley's superb 2006 feature \"Away from Her,\" the Canadian French-language short \"Henry\" (21:11) conveys the confustion and terror of Alzheimer's disease, focusing on the internal turmoil of the 84-year-old title character, a former concert pianist played with heart-wrenching authenticity by G\u00e9rard Poirier. It's mostly confined to one hospital corridor and directed with admirable finesse by popular Quebec actor Yan England, who employs fluid, almost waltz-like camera moves to visually manifest a disorienting parade (for Henry, not for the viewer) of people and emotions from Henry's past \u2014 most notably his violinist wife, Maria (Louise Laprade), whose apparent disappearance triggers Henry's innermost fears. Making fine use of Mascagni's \"Cavalleria Rusticana\" as a musical motif, \"Henry\" suggests that England, like fellow Canadian Polley, has a promising future behind the camera. Finally, there's \"Curfew\" (19:43), which qualifies as a lucky nomination for American actor/writer/director Shawn Christensen. I say \"lucky\" because, like last year's comedic nominee \"Time Freak,\" it's essentially a student film (albeit a well-made, well-funded, multiple-award-winning one) full of good-humored ideas that never gel into a satisfying whole. I'm guessing that most viewers will love the scene in which dozens of bowlers break into a funky dance routine in a crowded bowling alley, but for me it falls flat. The tissue-thin story concerns a carefree slacker named Richie (played by Christensen) who's recruited by his estranged sister to babysit his nine-year-old niece Sophia (Fatima Ptacek) for a few hours. The kid is smarter, wiser, and more responsible than her aimless uncle, and that's pretty much the extent of Christensen's \"comedy.\" Like the character he plays, \"Curfew\" meanders harmlessly from one barely-connected scene to another. Boil it down to its flimsy essence and \"Curfew\" is a mini-sitcom with lofty ambitions."}

Even a glaucoma victim could tell that it was a fake\u2014a doctored version of a photo of her as a\r\nstudent as Wellesley in 1969 that ran in Life\u00a0magazine\u2014but somehow this\r\nmanaged to get by him. When he did eventually post a vague correction, he\r\ninstead advised his followers to make fun of her glasses and hairdo, neither of\r\nwhich appear to be especially outrageous for a Wellesley student in the late \u201860s.\r\nNow imagine that photograph\u2014dubiously sourced, factually questionable and\r\nsuffused with nasty personal cracks instead of any legitimate insight or\r\ncriticism\u2014and you have D\u2019Souza\u2019s latest film, \u201cHillary\u2019s America: The Secret\r\nHistory of the Democratic Party,\u201d a work that almost makes his previous\r\ncinematic efforts, \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u201d seem lucid and well-reasoned by comparison. Little more than an extended\r\nversion of the kind of political screeds that can be found online with only a\r\nminimum of effort, this is just a terrible movie, and, depending on the\r\nconditions that were set forth, there is a chance it could be considered a\r\nparole violation as well. Advertisement If you think I'm being gratuitously mean (or giving up a\r\nspoiler) by referring to D\u2019Souza as a convicted felon, then you should know\r\nthat the movie actually opens with him being sentenced to eight months in a\r\nhalfway house, community service and a $30,000 fine for committing a\r\ncampaign-finance violation involving getting straw donors to contribute to the\r\ncampaign of a friend running for the U.S. Senate. According to the film,\r\nD\u2019Souza is really being convicted for the crime of having made a movie that\r\ndared to expose Obama as a lying, cheating monster hellbent on destroying\r\nAmerica. While in the stir\u2014in which he seems to be the only one not\r\nconvicted of a violent crime\u2014he asks around about the big gangs and how they\r\nconsolidate their power.

After finally departing the confinement center, D\u2019Souza knows\r\nwhat he has to do. This requires studying up on the Democratic Party\u2014something\r\nthat evidently never occurred to him before when he made films about it\u2014and\r\ntakes him to \u201cDemocratic Headquarters,\u201d a recreated location that appears to\r\nhave had its production design supervised by Tommy Wiseau and which contains a\r\nsecret basement in which all of their dirty secrets are kept from public view.\r\nAs it turns out, the Republicans were remarkably forward-thinking in all ways\r\nimaginable in regards to things like opposing slavery and the KKK while those\r\nDemocrats were busy seizing Indian lands, enslaving blacks and taking advantage\r\nof women. We learn of the monstrous policies of such infamous Democrats as\r\nWoodrow Wilson (who screened \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d at the White House) and\r\nLyndon Johnson (whose only interest in passing the Voting Rights Act was to\r\nappease Negroes who \u201care pretty uppity\u201d and to ensure their party loyalty for\r\nthe next 200 years). At this point, you may be thinking \u201cHey, didn\u2019t the\r\npolitical parties originally known as the Democrats and Republicans change and\r\nevolve over time to the point where the once-conservative Democrats became\r\nRepublicans and the more progressive Republicans became Democrats?\u201d Not so\r\nfast, according to D'Souza\u2014he assures us that nothing of the sort happened and\r\nthe only reason that Southern Democrats became Republican after the Voting\r\nRights Act was because the South became more prosperous and less racist because\r\nof Republican policies. (This factoid is accompanied by a picture of Ronald\r\nReagan, so you know it is true). The film also takes time to hit a couple of favorite non-elected\r\ntargets of the conservative movement. Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned\r\nParenthood, is presented as a character straight out of a horror film, and much\r\nis made of a lecture that she gave to a gathering of female KKK members. Of\r\ncourse, the film doesn\u2019t mention that Sanger at the time basically spoke to\r\nanyone who would listen regarding birth control (she later described the talk\r\nas \u201cone of the weirdest experiences I had in lectures\u201d), or how she was praised\r\nin later years by none other than Martin Luther King Jr. Then there is Saul\r\nAlinsky, who is portrayed as a criminal monster who worked his way up from\r\nscamming cheap meals as a starving student to practically becoming the\r\nright-hand man to gangster Frank Nitti, eventually taking the lessons he\r\nlearned there to organizing liberal types in order to seize power for the\r\nsocialist agenda by pushing from the outside. Eventually, one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\r\noutdoes him by remarking that if they can somehow take over the government,\r\n\u201cThen we can push from the inside.\u201d  Advertisement That prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is none other than Hillary Clinton, and after\r\nsneaking into the basement of a Clinton recruitment center, D\u2019Souza learns the\r\nshocking truth about her as well. By \u201cshocking truth,\u201d of course, the information amounts to \u201clargely discredited crap your uncle sent you on Facebook.\u201d The tenor of this\r\nsegment is set with D\u2019Souza asking \u201cIs Hillary really capable of enabling a\r\nrapist?\u201d and it goes downhill from there as we get another rehash of husband Bill\u2019s\r\ninfidelities (there are many shots of a woman in a sexy black dress slinking\r\nout of various places), Hillary ranting through the halls of the White House, a\r\nrecounting of that uranium scandal that turned out to be much ado about nothing\r\nand the possible depravations of the Clinton Foundation. As for Benghazi, he\r\nsupposes that she refused to send in help because \u201cshe couldn\u2019t figure out how\r\nto make a buck off of them.\u201d As this segment ends, D\u2019Souza denounces them for\r\ntheir \u201chateful rhetoric\u201d before calling them \u201cdepraved crooks\u201d who will \u201cturn\r\nall of America into a plantation\u201d if she is elected president. At no time,\r\nhowever, does he make any sort of case for an alternative to her in this\r\nelection cycle. Even though the film is up-to-date enough to include a moment\r\nsuggesting that Obama was responsible for the massacre in Orlando, there is, at\r\nmost, one brief and vague reference to Donald Trump. All of this is conveyed by D\u2019Souza in the most cinematically\r\ninept ways imaginable. The film is less a coherent narrative than a compendium\r\nof slanders, innuendos, cherry-picked facts, blatant omissions, stuff taken almost\r\ndirectly from his earlier documentaries, terrible historical reenactments, a couple of\r\ninterviews that convey additional information of a highly dubious manner and\r\nironic clips from movies that you will wish that you had watched instead of this\r\none (including \u201cMetropolis\u201d and \u201cEvita\"). From a filmmaking perspective, the\r\nwhole thing is so amateurishly done that even those who fall close to D\u2019Souza\r\non the political spectrum should feel ripped off. Worst of all, it utterly\r\nfails at its mission of being the ultimate Hillary Clinton takedown by never\r\nlaying a single glove on her. This is especially astounding, as even those\r\ninclined to support her could probably name a couple of things she has done in\r\nher years in the spotlight that are legitimately questionable\u2014her vote for the\r\nwar in Iraq and her embrace of the teachings of Henry Kissinger to name a\r\ncouple\u2014but instead of exploring those, D\u2019Souza is more concerned with calling\r\nBill Clinton a sex abuser but blaming it all on Hillary.  \u201cHillary\u2019s\r\nAmerica\u201d may well be the single dumbest documentary that I have ever seen in my\r\nlife\u2014nearly two hours of poisonous bluster and anti-historical rhetoric that\r\ncomes across like the desperate ravings of someone trying to make a few more\r\nbucks by rehashing the same nonsense before his gravy train\r\nfinally leaves town. The closest thing I can compare it to are the\r\nstrange and highly speculative documentaries that Sunn Classics used to crank\r\nout in the late Seventies\u2014movies that breathlessly promised viewers that they\r\nwould reveal the existence of life after death or the Bermuda Triangle or\r\nNoah\u2019s Ark but only gave people clumsy reenactments, interviews with highly\r\ndubious experts and wild speculation without ever actually offering any of the\r\nconcrete proof that they promised. Those films used to get huge audiences, but\r\nonce viewers caught on to the con, interest dropped sharply. And if the drop in\r\ninterest between D\u2019Souza\u2019s first two films is any indication (\u201c2016\u201d was a sizable hit but \u201cAmerica\u201d came and went so quickly that he never makes reference to\r\nit once here), there is an excellent chance this film will face the same fate.\r\nThe only intelligent thought the film has to offer comes at the very end when\r\nD\u2019Souza admonishes people to go out and vote. Okay, he can\u2019t, but the thought\r\nis still nice. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Savages", "Review": "\"The Savages\" seems a curious movie to be opening four days before Christmas, but maybe not: Christmas Day itself is said to be the top moviegoing day of the year, as families (a) seek something they can do together without having to talk, or (b) use them as a excuse to escape from the house. Not all holidays are by Norman Rockwell, and maybe some grown children will enjoy this touching, humorous film about an elderly father whose time has come to leave his \"retirement community\" and move into \"assisted living\" (which my Aunt Mary referred to as \"assisted dying\"). Advertisement Wendy and Jon Savage (Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman) are sister and brother, she living in New York City, he living in Buffalo; she an aspiring playwright, he a professor and author of books about the theater. They are smart, articulate and knowledgeable about drama, attributes that do them no good at all when they get a call from Sun City that their dad, Lenny (Philip Bosco), has started to write on the wall with his excrement. After some reluctance, mostly on Jon's part, they fly to Arizona and find their dad shacked up with Doris, a girlfriend his age. I was reminded of a friend of mine whose 85-year-old dad discovered Viagra and insisted on calling his son with daily reports on his sex life. My friend pleaded with him to spare the details. There are some things children desperately do not want to know. Doris spares them the occasion for such reports, however, by suddenly passing away, and Jon and Wendy decide to move their father to Buffalo so he will be close to them. He is a hostile curmudgeon who probably moved to Arizona to get away from them, but now he's in no position to resist. Writer-director Tamara Jenkins (\"The Slums of Beverly Hills\") doesn't sentimentalize this material; quite the opposite. Lenny remains Lenny to the best of his ability, which means a short temper, a foul vocabulary and a constant state of irritation. We gather that he was not a joy to grow up with; indeed, the scars still borne by his children are such that they refer to their childhoods only obliquely. Whatever the relationship between their parents was like, it has left them unable to form liaisons of their own; Wendy is having a joyless affair with a married man, and Jon has a Polish girlfriend who he refuses to marry, even if it would save her from deportation back to Poland. That he weeps over his inability shows that he is aware of his emotional scars and fears to heal them. There is a genre of movies set in old-folks' homes that resemble sitcoms, including colorful characters, lots of one-liners and a pecking order. The nursing home they find for Lenny in Buffalo is the next step after such a place. It is essentially run by the caregivers, who treat their clients something like misbehaving children. One who seems to care is a Nigerian immigrant named Jimmy (Gbenga Akinnagbe), who sympathizes with the children and shares lore about caring for the aged. Kristen Thomson played a similar character in Sarah Polley's \"Away from Her\" -- the experienced nurse who knows what the family has gone through, and will go through. Advertisement A movie like this depends on nuance and performance if it is not to descend entirely into soap opera. Jenkins knows that and is quietly insistent that we observe little moments and dropped words and exchanged glances. The resettling of Jon and Wendy's father causes the resettling of their own lives and forces them to examine memories they hoped were buried. Both Linney and Hoffman are so specific in creating these characters that we see them as people, not elements in a plot. Hoffman in particular shows how many disguises he has within his seemingly immutable presence; would you know it is the same actor here and in two other films this season, \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\" and \"Charlie Wilson's War\"? \"The Savages\" confronts a day that may come in all of our lives. Two days, actually, the first when we are younger, the second when we are older. \"The Ballad of Narayama,\" a great Japanese film, is about a community that decides when a person has outlived any usefulness and leaves that person on the mountain to die. It seems cruel, but even the dying seem to think it appropriate. Better that, after being healthy and strong once, than to be reduced to writing on walls with excrement."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Redacted", "Review": "The rape and subsequent murders in \"Redacted\" actually happened, and we are told that director Brian De Palma found out about them on the Internet, in blogs and YouTube postings and on American and Arab sites. He fictionalizes the events, as he must for legal reasons, but presents them in a way suggesting how he found them; the movie looks cobbled together largely from found Web footage. It's better photographed than much similar material on the Web, and edited to create a relentless momentum, but he wants us to feel as if we're discovering this material for ourselves. Advertisement So we would be forced to, if the movie's buried message is clear. \"Redacted\" is a word simply meaning \"edited\" and is often used by the military as a way of calling a simple act by an objective, and therefore defused, name. In a similar fashion, a \"rendition\" can be a kidnapping and torture. The film explains the origin of much of its footage by introducing us to a soldier named Angel Salazar (Izzy Diaz), who carries a digital video camera and thinks maybe he can make a documentary to get him into film school. A good plan, but if you notice that the movie is set in Samarra, you may recall the parable of the man whose best-laid plans went wrong there. The story comes down to this: The soldiers of Alfa Company are manning a checkpoint. A car speeds past. They open fire, and a pregnant woman and her unborn child are killed. Two more hearts and minds not won over. In retribution, one of the company's members is killed by local militia. In response, the two men who fired on the car (Rush, played by Daniel Stewart Sherman, and the well-named Flake, played by Patrick Carroll) lead a nighttime raid during which a 15-year-old girl is raped, her family is murdered and their house set afire. Company members are informed by Flake and Rush that if they don't keep quiet, they will die. There is no reason to doubt this. Much of this action mirrors the events in an earlier De Palma film, \"Casualties of War\" (1989), in which Michael J. Fox played a Vietnam soldier who turned away from a rape. What is different in this film is the visual style, which informs us by its very nature that after the invention of the cheap video camera and the Internet, few actions can be assumed to be secret. De Palma uses the method to demonstrate how good (or neutral) soldiers can be turned into criminals or silent accomplices by a threat of violence from their comrades. How if you put men in a hellhole and arm them, and if they are predisposed to violence, they will not always follow the rules, or even remember them. Advertisement \"Redacted\" is a metaphor for what De Palma and others believe is the fatal flaw of our Iraq strategy: You cannot enforce \"freedom\" at gunpoint. Now that some 200,000 Iraqis have died in the war, for whatever reason and at whatever hands, it is hard to see how many of the rest would be as grateful for our presence as we are assured they are. This is something Angel Salazar finds out during the filming of his documentary, although unfortunately his key footage is redacted in a very direct way. You may be vaguely aware of a controversy involving De Palma and some of his own footage that was \"redacted.\" This involved the montage of \"actual\" photographs from Iraq, which close the film. They were all actual at one point, but now some of them are staged, and others have been altered by having faces obscured by a black marker pen, lest the subjects' privacy be violated. Since they are dead, one doubts they would sue, but perhaps the black smudges make De Palma's point in another way. The acting is curious. Some of it is convincing, and some of the rest is convincing in a different way: It convinces us that non-actors know they are being filmed and are acting and speaking slightly differently than they otherwise would. That makes some try to appear nicer, and other try to appear tougher or more menacing. That edge of inauthentic performance paradoxically increases the effect: Moments seem more real because they are not acted flawlessly. The result of the film is shocking, saddening and frustrating. The latest polls show that the great majority of the American public has withdrawn its approval from the war and its architects. Why should it be a mystery that the Iraqis do not love us? Did our mothers not ask us, \"How would you feel if someone did that to you?\" Yes, they are killing us, too, but they live there, and we went a great distance for our appointment in Samarra. The name of the real girl, who was actually 14, was Abeer Qasim Hamza al-Janabi."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Train to Busan", "Review": "Yeon Sang-ho\u2019s \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d is the most purely\r\nentertaining zombie film in some time, finding echoes of George Romero\u2019s and Danny Boyle\u2019s\r\nwork, but delivering something unique for an era in which kindness to others\r\nseems more essential than ever. For decades, movies about the undead have\r\nessentially been built on a foundation of fear of our fellow man\u2014your neighbor\r\nmay look and sound like you, but he wants to eat your brain\u2014but \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d\r\ntakes that a step further by building on the idea that, even in our darkest\r\ndays, we need to look out for each other, and it is those who climb over the\r\nweak to save themselves who will suffer. Social commentary aside, it\u2019s also\r\njust a wildly fun action movie, beautifully paced and constructed, with just\r\nthe right amount of character and horror. In many ways, it\u2019s what \u201cWorld War Z\u201d\r\nshould have been\u2014a nightmarish vision of the end of the world, and a provocation\r\nto ask ourselves what it is that really makes us human in the first place. Advertisement Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) is a divorced workaholic. He lives with\r\nhis mother and barely spends any time with his daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an). He\u2019s\r\nso distant from her that he buys her a Nintendo Wii for her birthday, ignoring\r\nthat she has one already, and that he\u2019s the one who bought it for her for\r\nChildren\u2019s Day. To make up for this rather-awkward moment, he agrees to give\r\nSu-an what she really wants\u2014a trip to her mother\u2019s home in Busan, 280 miles\r\naway. It\u2019s just an hour train ride from Seoul. What could possibly go wrong?\r\nEven the set-up is a thematic beauty, as this is more than just a train ride\r\nfor Seok-woo and Su-an\u2014it\u2019s a journey into the past as a father tries to mend\r\nbridges and fix that which may be dead. It\u2019s a perfect setting for a zombie\r\nmovie. Before they even get to their early-morning train ride,\r\nSeok-woo and Su-an see a convoy of emergency vehicles headed into Seoul. When\r\nthey get to the train, Sang-ho beautifully sets up his cast of characters,\r\ngiving us beats with the conductors, a pair of elderly sisters, a husband and\r\nhis pregnant wife, an obnoxious businessman (a vision of Seok-woo in a couple\r\ndecades), and even a baseball team. A woman who\u2019s clearly not well gets on the\r\ntrain just before it departs, and just as something else disturbing but\r\ngenerally unseen is happening in the station above the platform. Before you\r\nknow it, the woman is taking out the jugular of a conductor, who immediately\r\nbecomes a similarly mindless killing machine. These are zombies of the \u201c28 Days\r\nLater\u201d variety\u2014fast, focused, and violent. They replicate like a virus, turning\r\nwhole cars of the train into dead-eyed flesh-eaters in a matter of seconds.\r\nThey are rabid dogs. And you thought your Metra commute was bad. The claustrophobic tension of \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d is amplified\r\nafter a brilliantly staged sequence in a train station in which our surviving\r\ntravelers learn that the entire country has gone brain-hungry. They discover\r\nthat the undead can\u2019t quite figure out door handles and are mostly blind, so\r\ntunnels and lines of sight become essential. Sang-ho also keeps up his social\r\ncommentary, giving us characters who want to do anything to survive, and others\r\nwho will do what it takes to save others. Early in the film, Seok-woo tells his\r\ndaughter, \u201cAt a time like this, only watch out for yourself,\u201d but he learns\r\nthat this isn\u2019t the advice we should live by or pass down to our children.\r\nWithout spoiling anything, the survivors of \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d are only so lucky\r\nbecause of the sacrifice of others. And the film is thematically stronger than\r\nyour average zombie flick in the way it captures how panic can make monsters of\r\nus all, and it is our responsibility to overcome that base instinct in times of\r\ncrisis. After the near-perfect first hour of \u201cTrain to Busan,\u201d the film slows its progress and makes a few stops that feel repetitive, but the journey recovers\r\nnicely for a memorable finale. You could call it \u201cTrain of the Living Dead\u201d or \u201c'Snowpiercer' with Zombies.\u201d Whatever you call it, if it\u2019s playing in your city and you\u2019ve\r\never been entertained by a zombie movie, it\u2019s hard to believe you wouldn\u2019t be\r\nentertained by this one.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Notes on Blindness", "Review": "In addition to a being packaged with a virtual reality experience at selected theaters, \u201cNotes on Blindness\u201d is being released in formats for blind and sighted audiences. I wish I\u2019d been sent the former version. I just wanted to close my eyes and listen to the film\u2019s realistic sounds and the narration by its subject, theologian John Hull. Hull made an acclaimed series of audio journal entries detailing how he coped with losing his sight. His work received several commendations from organizations for the blind, and it makes for powerful, compelling listening. Advertisement But\u00a0the central conceit of \u201cNotes on Blindness\u201d is to emulate Hull\u2019s descent into blindness using visuals. When directors Pete Middleton and James Spinney do clever things like keeping bits of information and action off-screen while we hear Hull\u2019s frustration over having to ask for descriptions of what\u2019s happening, the film achieves its goal. But quite often, the filmmakers go for blurry scenery, surreal events and odd camera shots that feel more like gimmicks than an accurate representation of its subject\u2019s affliction. My problems with overcoming the Uncanny Valley effect of the film\u2019s gimmickry may stem from the fact that\u00a0I am half-blind. I lost the vision in my left eye due to a retinal detachment when I was 14. So Hull\u2019s discussions about ripped retinas and botched eye surgeries resonated greatly with me. And though I have a decent amount of sight in my good eye, I fully understood Hull\u2019s initial unwillingness to accept his new condition. I felt the same way, and my similar fears were supported by the knowledge that my family is genetically predisposed to losing our vision. It\u2019s more a destination than an option for us. So Hull\u2019s story was indeed inspiring to me. He continued to teach at the university he worked at pre-blindness, and he was devoted to bridging the gap of understanding between the sighted and the unsighted world until his death in 2015. But I couldn\u2019t fully abide by the rules \u201cNotes on Blindness\u201d played by, though I suspect I may be in the minority here. One thing that does work very well is the onscreen re-enactments of several journal entries by actors Dan Skinner and Simone Kirby, who lip-sync to Hull's and his wife, Marilyn\u2019s voices. This could have very easily been a distraction, but Skinner is excellent and Kirby practically vibrates with love for her onscreen husband. When Hull says on the soundtrack that, for the first time, he felt completely useless, Skinner nails the moment onscreen. There are also a few effective scenes with the child actors playing the Hull children; their inquiries about their father\u2019s blindness are answered in a loving, supportive manner. Advertisement Hull\u2019s journal entries contain enough memorable moments to warrant seeking them out. A meeting with a faith healer takes an unexpected turn. And Hull\u2019s visit to his parents back in Australia begets the most haunting passages used in the film. He acknowledges that losing his sight has caused him to forget what many once-familiar things looked like, and this is especially distressing once he returns to his childhood home. The powerful nostalgia of his youth has slipped away, disappearing along with his vision. \u201cNotes on Blindness\u201d has won several awards since its Sundance Film Festival premiere. If the subject interests you, don\u2019t let my mildly negative review dissuade you from going to see it. I would like to see it again myself, but this time in the version I can share with several of my relatives whose vision is no longer present. I really think I\u2019d like that version more, and I\u2019d love to hear what my family thinks of It too. But you can keep the VR element. It can\u2019t compete with the real thing for me."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Single Moms Club", "Review": "\"The Single Moms Club\" is almost good. The premise, if not the most original thing in the world, is at least full of promise. Five single mothers from different backgrounds are thrown together by the principal at their childrens' prep school, and told to plan a fundraiser. The school is threatening to expel their kids due to various infractions, and somehow (it's never made clear why) forcing the mothers of these bad kids to plan an event is seen as the perfect solution. Never mind. These devices are par for the course in a Tyler Perry film. So is an overwhelming desire to tie everything up in a neat bow. The movie is called \"The Single Moms Club,\" but Perry can't stick with the theme of that title, not really; he can't resist making sure that every lady has a man by the end. Nobody's going to be a \"single mom\" for long.  Advertisement One of the single moms is Hillary (Amy Smart). She's recovering from a nasty divorce from her attorney husband, who has reduced alimony, forcing her to \"let go of her help,\" primarily a Spanish-speaking maid who spends more time with her three kids than she does. Another single mom is Jan (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a book editor struggling to prove to her otherwise all-male workspace that she can do a good job as partner even though she's, well, a single mom. May (Nia Long, in a terrific performance) is a journalist and aspiring author, trying to guide her troubled son Rick through the rough waters of having an absentee drug addict for a dad. Zulay Henao plays Esperanza, a woman still under the thumb of her bossy ex-husband, who threatens to kick her out of the house he bought for her if she dares to bring another man home. And finally there is Lytia (Cocoa Brown), a woman with five kids (the two eldest in jail), a waitressing job, no car, and a determination to keep her 12-year-old son on the straight and narrow. The first meeting of the Single Moms Club does not go well, and there is the usual culture and class clash. Lytia has zero sympathy for the rich helpless white women who don't know what they will do without a maid. Jan finds Lytia hard and \"like a big black wall\" (an unfortunate phrase, which she then elaborates on, in an incredibly awkward extended monologue). Eventually, of course, they all start to see one another as equals and friends. Walls break down. The women set up a rotating babysitting system so that they can have at least one night off a week, and they also get to work planning the charity event. Writer/producer/director/actor Tyler Perry juggles all of this pretty well, and the actors are sympathetic and engaging. The real challenges of people trying to parent alone are highlighted. He even shows sympathy for Hillary, who didn't know her own daughter got her period because her daughter told the maid instead of her. You feel for all of them. There is a good balance in the dynamic, and it makes sense that these different women might become \r\nfriends. Despite their differences, they have a lot in common. Advertisement But then the men start showing up, one by one, in a muddled parade. First there is T.K. (Tyler Perry), who meets-cute with May in a parking lot, then shows up at her house with the purse she left behind. He tells her he looked through her purse and found her book manuscript in there and read it and thought it was really good, and can he take her out to dinner? Because this is La-La Land and not reality, May does not seem alarmed or freaked out by his behavior.\u00a0 Hillary, meanwhile, awkwardly lusts over her handyman neighbor (Ryan Eggold), but is too shy to make a move. Esperanza is in love with a bartender named Manny (William Levy) but is terrified that her ex-husband will find out. Jan has been celibate for 10 years, but May introduces her to one of her co-workers and Voila, Jan is back on the road to love. Meanwhile, Lytia is being courted (against her will, really) by a swaggering personal trainer named Branson who keeps showing up at her place of work and won't take No for an answer. The romances are handled slapdash. When T.K. and May first kiss it is so awkward it looks like a mistake. With the exception of Esperanza and Manny, nobody has any real chemistry and the \"finding love\" storylines just do not mesh with the overall message of the film. The script feels lazy in that way. But sometimes (rarely but sometimes), there's a moment, a mood, that is touching, poignant, even powerful. The best scene in the film involves May and her son Rick. Rick's dad (never seen in the \r\nfilm) had promised his son he'd pick him up from school, and Dad is once again a no-show. Instead of having a heart-to-heart with her son, she lets him be and waits nearby in the car as her son, small and defeated, sits on the school steps. Jan, on her way to pick up her own daughter, asks May what's going on, and May, staring over at Rick, keeping her distance, says, \"I try to see which way Rick\u2019s going to fall, and I try to catch him.\" Nia Long is a beautiful actress, with a fresh and natural presence. She is emotionally accessible and funny. Neither the bossy machinations of the script nor its requirement that she pair up with T.K. at the end can dim her light."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Nights in Rodanthe", "Review": "\"Nights in Rodanthe\" is what Variety likes to call a \"weeper.\" The term is not often intended as praise. The movie attempts to jerk tears with one clunky device after another, in a plot that is a perfect storm of cliche and contrivance. In fact, it even contains a storm -- an imperfect one. The movie stars Richard Gere and Diane Lane, back again, together again, after \"Unfaithful\" (2002). I have no complaints about their work here. Admiration, rather, as they stay afloat despite the film's plot, location, voice-overs and not-very-special effects. They are true movie stars and have a certain immunity against infection by dreck. Advertisement He plays Paul, a surgeon. She is Adrienne, a mother of two, separated from her snaky husband. To help out a friend, she is taking care of a rustic inn on an island off the Outer Banks of North Carolina. He is the only weekend guest. He has booked in to \"be by myself,\" he says, and also to \"find someone to talk to.\" To summarize: These two beautiful, unhappy people are alone in a romantic beachfront inn. If the inn is really where it seems to be, on the edge of the water in a vast stretch of deserted, high-priced beach frontage, then it is not CGI and will soon be listed as This Week magazine's \"steal of the week.\" A hurricane is approaching. Hurricane warnings are issued hours before it arrives. A grizzled old-timer at the local grocery wisely says it's gonna be real big. Adrienne stocks up on white bread. Having spent days watching CNN as little whirling 2s and 3s inched across the Gulf Coast, I would say this warning was belated. Paul doesn't evacuate because of some dialogue he is made to say. Adrienne doesn't because she promised her friend to look after the inn. They put up some shutters and have a jolly game of indoor basketball while tossing spoiled canned goods into a garbage can. Ratatouille! Spam! Lard!  The hurricane strikes. If it has a name, they don't know it. It blows off some shutters and cuts off the power. Do they face \"certain death\"? They cling to each other while sitting on the floor next to a bed. Then they cling to each other after getting into the bed. Have you ever made love during a hurricane that is shaking the house? I haven't. How did it go for you? The hurricane bangs the shutters like the Amityville Horror. It must have no eye, so the wind only blows once. In the morning after the storm, the sun is shining, and the inn is still standing. Remarkable, really, considering the photos from Galveston. It is a three- or four-story clapboard building, taller than it is wide, standing on stilts at the veritable water's edge. In the morning, we see damage: a skateboard and a bike, blown up. Some trees blown over. Just the most wonderful gnarly old piece of driftwood. Advertisement Reader, they fall in love. They deal with the real reason Paul came to Rodanthe, which I will say nothing about, except that it involves a grieving man who is well-played by Scott Glenn. Paul and Adrienne have found true love for the first time in their lives. Paul has an estranged son who has opened a clinic on a mountainside in Ecuador. He must go there. They exchange letters. The mountainside has no telephones, but excellent mail service. The letters serve the function of the notebook in the (much better) adaptation of Sparks' The Notebook. These letters are read aloud in voice-overs that would not distinguish a soap opera. Does Paul find his son? Does Adrienne reunite with her snarky husband? Does her troubled and hostile teenage daughter turn into a honeybun from one scene to the next? Does the movie depend upon a deus ex machina  to propel itself toward the lachrymose conclusion? Yes, no, yes and yes."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Alexandra", "Review": "It is as simple as this. An old lady is helped on board an armored military train and journeys all night to visit a remote Russian army outpost. The soldiers seem to know about her and her visit, and after a couple of local boys apparently try to \"guide\" her away from her suitcase, two soldiers in uniform turn up and escort her to the base. We already know a lot about her. We know she is opinionated, proud, stubborn, and not afraid to express her feelings. She marches through the heat and dust into the base, and is guided to her \"hotel,\" a room with two cots in a barracks made of tents. Other information is revealed, slowly. Her name is Alexandra (Galina Vishnevskaya). She is here to visit her grandson, Denis. He is a captain in the army. Advertisement The base is in Chechnya. It is a Muslim republic, occupied by Russian forces, who are sullenly disliked. On the the base, discipline seems informal, the soldiers lax. When Denis (Vasily Shevtsov) turns up, she is appalled by the state of his uniform and advises him to wash up. She also sniffs disapprovingly at other soldiers, tells helpers \"Don't pull my arm\" and \"Don't push me!\" and that she is perfectly capable of taking care of herself. The next day, she wanders the base so early that no one seems to be around, and that was when I remembered a similar scene in Bergman's \"Wild Strawberries,\" about an old man who dreams of wandering in a deserted town. There are other parallels between the two films, but Bergman's is about an old man discovering himself, and \"Alexandra\" is about an old woman being discovered. She is a transformative presence. The film was written and directed by Alexander Sokurov, maker of the remarkable \"Russian Ark\" -- remember that one, in which he used only one uninterrupted shot to tour the Hermitage Museum? Here, he follows the woman as she talks her way past a guarded checkpoint and wanders into town to find the market. She is tired and hot. It must be 100 degrees. She meets Malika (Raisa Gichaeva), a woman about her age, who gives her a seat in her booth, is friendly, gives her cigarettes and cookies, knowing that they will go to Russian soldiers. Then she invites Alexandra home to her flat in a building missing a big chunk because of bombs or shells. The two old women bond, and their conversation is the essence of the film. If the locals do not like the Russians, the Russians do not like their duty. They can't see the point of it. They are not wanted, they will never be wanted, so why are they forced to stay? These conclusions aren't said in so many words, but they permeate the film. And notice the way some locals look at her with pointed dislike, and some soldiers simply stare at her, perhaps because she is the only woman on the base and reminds them of grandmothers, mothers, sisters, girlfriends -- the whole world outside their existence. Advertisement Alexandra is not a sweet little old lady. The fact that she is played by Vishnevskaya, who once ruled the Russian opera, may supply a hint of where she gets her confidence, her imperious manner. But when she hugs her grandson, when he braids her hair, when she says he \"smells like a man\" and she loves that smell, we get a window into her youth and her memories. Remarkable, how little Sokurov tells us, while telling us so much. The color strategy of the movie is part of its effect. It is drab, brown, desaturated. Reds and greens are pale, sometimes not even visible. Everything is covered with dust. Brighter colors would add vitality to the base, but that would be wrong. The point is that for the soldiers, it's a dead zone, life on hold, a cheerless existence. And this plain-spoken old woman reminds them of a lifetime they are missing."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Unrest", "Review": "This movie opens with some disquieting images, from home video footage. A young woman lies on a wood floor, her face horizontal to the lens. She talks about how hard it is to move, and then, keeping the camera with her, she demonstrates her difficulty, crawling and wiggling and undulating. Soon, she and the camera are in a car, and the driver, presumably the woman\u2019s husband, is asking his GPS for \u201cPrinceton Hospital,\u201d and the GPS keeps telling him how to get to \u201cPrinceton Animal Hospital.\u201d The momentary comic relief of the moment is only slightly mitigated by the question of what kind of people become residents of a town and don\u2019t bother to learn of the location of its various medical facilities some time prior to an actual medical situation.  Advertisement We can get to that later, or maybe not at all. As it happens, \u201cUnrest,\u201d which was directed by Jennifer Brea, the woman in the opening footage, has enough pertinent stuff to say about a little-known and terrifying disease that such nits don\u2019t stick in the mind as the movie ends. At the time that Brea was struck with a fever that left her in enervated pain in its wake, she had been living a storybook life of sort, if being an upper middle class academic is your idea of a storybook life. Looks pretty pleasant from the snatches shown here. After a hellish diagnosis process, she learned that she had ME, that is, myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The diagnosis was the beginning of more trouble, because little is understood of the disease, and in our neck of the Western world, it\u2019s not taken at all seriously. An audio clip of Larry King referring to it as \u201cthe yuppie virus\u201d and a visual of the ever-helpful Ricky Gervais making a joke about how the disease is also known as \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to work today\u201d illustrate the point in a shameful way. This is why, I think, Brea is so relentless in documenting her own symptoms, which look utterly miserable. Forms of paralysis, an inability to withstand bright light, and more, are what she suffers.  The movie opens up to show other victims of the disease. One of them was abandoned by her own damn husband, who was convinced it was psychosomatic. His \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d moment happens when he learns one of their adult daughters has gotten ME somehow. There\u2019s worse across the ocean. In Denmark, one sufferer, Karina Hansen, was taken by state authorities from her parents' care and placed in a psychiatric hospital because of an institutionalized \u201cit\u2019s all in her head\u201d belief.  This is jaw-dropping stuff, made more profoundly disturbing by the fact that so little is known about the disease\u2014its causes, let alone what can effectively treat it. This information is parceled out in a coherent documentary style that alternates with the story of Brea herself, her struggles with the disease and its treatment. This domestic story is wrenching. Not only has the disease wreaked havoc on Brea\u2019s academic work, it\u2019s cast severe doubt on she and her husband\u2019s ability to start a larger family. Brea\u2019s husband is Omar Wasow, who some of you with long media memories may remember as being a prominent personality on cable news and analysis shows back in the \u201890s. Mr. Wasow was a proselytizer for the new age of digital media and communications, and a rather Panglossian one at that. He\u2019s older and a little grayer now, and still carries himself at times with the aura of a confident talking head. But you can\u2019t help but feel for the guy, and for Brea. However you feel about its messengers, though, \u201cUnrest\u201d is a documentary that serves a vital function. Ricky Gervais notwithstanding, this disease is no joke, and it\u2019s not going to be addressed as the scourge that it is until a larger portion of the population gets that. This movie should help."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Marley & Me", "Review": "The second-greatest headline in the history of the Onion is: Millions of pet owners demand\rto know: \"Who's a good boy?\" This line is not frequently used in the Grogan household. There is a reason for that. Marley is not a good boy. I'd love to have a dog around the house, but not Marley. We have, you know, stuff we like. Books, dishes, tables, chairs, rugs, curtains. You know how it is. Marley considers such objects to be food, playthings or enemies. There was a real Marley. He belonged to John and Jennifer Grogan, and was the subject of a 2005 best seller that has been adapted into this film. I hope the book earned enough to pay for Marley's overhead. Marley has the behavior pattern of a manic wrecking crew and the appetite of a science-fiction monster, but you gotta love him. At least, the Grogans gotta love him. They may be as crazy as their dog. Here is a useful lesson. When you go to the pet lady, and she shows you a group of Labrador puppies and one is cheaper than all the others, this is not the time to go bargain-hunting. Advertisement \"Marley & Me\" is a cheerful family movie about a young couple starting out in life with a new house, new jobs, a new dog and then three children, who the dog doesn't eat, or the movie wouldn't be rated PG. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston play the Grogans as brave and resourceful. Every couple has to survive ups and downs in their marriage, but Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette might be alive today if they'd adopted Marley, he had eaten the crown jewels, and they'd fled the palace and abdicated.  You would think the dog would supply the playful, upbeat elements in this movie. Not exactly. Marley supplies the Sturm und Drang, 24-7. It is John Grogan's professional life that supplies the fantasy. He gets a job as a cub reporter on a newspaper and is soon ordered by his editor (Alan Arkin) to become a columnist. Nothing doing! he says. He'd rather cover school board meetings and sewer inspectors. Arkin counters: \"I'll double your salary!\" In today's newspaper world, this plays like escapist porn. Grogan would be ordered to carry a route on his way to work, and Arkin would be replaced by Uncle Scrooge. But Grogan makes the canny decision to write a column about the dog, and it is a great success. Soon the column and the dog are beloved. Marley becomes as useful to Grogan as Slats Grobnik was to Mike Royko: always good for a column on a slow day. Come to think of it, Marley has all the earmarks of having been trained by Slats, starting out as a puppy by eating barstools and spittoons. This may be the first family film I've seen that will frighten more adults than children. The Marley kids, Conor, Patrick and Colleen, all love Marley. Their parents are appalled. At one point, Jennifer actually despairs and tells John that either the dog goes or she does. No, actually, she doesn't force him to choose. She's outta there. But she relents and returns to the doggie from hell. The thing about Marley, see, is that he has an uncanny way of knowing exactly when to pause in eating the garage and gaze soulfully upon his masters with unconditional love. When Marley is not on the screen, Wilson and Aniston demonstrate why they are gifted comic actors. They have a relationship that's not too sitcomish, not too sentimental, mostly smart and realistic. That's because she plays a newspaper reporter, too. Marley would have been a welcome break after a day in the riotous city rooms of the good old days. In today's city rooms, reporters hide in their cubicles praying to escape extermination. I say lock Scrooge in a cage and throw in Marley. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Split", "Review": "Within the process of watching an M. Night Shyamalan film, there exists a parallel and simultaneous process of searching for its inevitable twist. This has been true of every film the writer-director has made since his surprise smash debut, \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d nearly two decades ago. We wonder: How will he dazzle us? What clues should we be searching for? Will it actually work this time? Increasingly, with middling efforts like \u201cThe Village\u201d and \u201cLady in the Water\u201d\u2014and dreary aberrations like \u201cThe Last Airbender\u201d and \u201cAfter Earth,\u201d which bore none of his signature style\u2014the answer to that last question has been: Not really. Which makes his latest, \u201cSplit,\u201d such an exciting return to form. A rare, straight-up horror film from Shyamalan, \u201cSplit\u201d is a thrilling reminder of what a technical master he can be. All his virtuoso camerawork is on display: his lifelong, loving homage to Alfred Hitchcock, which includes, as always, inserting himself in a cameo. And the twist\u2014that there is no Big Twist\u2014is one of the most refreshing parts of all. Advertisement \u201cSplit\u201d is more lean and taut in its narrative and pace than we\u2019ve seen from Shyamalan lately. Despite its nearly two-hour running time, it feels like it\u2019s in constant forward motion, even when it flashes backward to provide perspective. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s a spring in his step, even as he wallows in grunge. And a lot of that has to do with the tour-de-force performance from James McAvoy as a kidnapper named Kevin juggling two-dozen distinct personalities. From obsessive-compulsive maintenance man Dennis to playful, 9-year-old Hedwig to prim, British Patricia to flamboyant, New York fashionista Barry, McAvoy brings all these characters to life in undeniably hammy yet entertaining ways. There\u2019s a lot of scenery chewing going on here, but it\u2019s a performance that also showcases McAvoy\u2019s great agility and precision. He has to make changes both big and small, sometimes in the same breath, and it\u2019s a hugely engaging spectacle to behold. His portrayal of this troubled soul is darkly funny but also unexpectedly sad. Kevin is menacing no matter which personality in control, but the underlying childhood trauma that caused him to create these alter egos as a means of defense clearly still haunts him as a grown man. Flashes of vulnerability and fragility reveal themselves in the film\u2019s third act, providing an entirely different kind of disturbing tone. First, though, there is the abduction, which Shyamalan stages in efficient, gripping fashion. Three high school girls get in a car after a birthday party at the mall: pretty, chatty Claire (Haley Lu Richardson of \u201cThe Edge of Seventeen\u201d) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) and shy, quiet Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), who was invited along out of pity. But they quickly realize the man behind the wheel isn\u2019t Claire\u2019s dad\u2014it\u2019s Kevin, who wastes no time in knocking them out and dragging them back to his makeshift, underground lair. Repeated visits from Kevin, with his varying voices and personae, gradually make it clear that their kidnapper harbors multiple personalities. Only Casey, who emerges as the trio\u2019s clever leader, has the audacity to engage with him. As she showed in her breakout role in \u201cThe Witch\u201d as well as in \u201cMorgan,\u201d Taylor-Joy can be chilling in absolute stillness with her wide, almond eyes\u2014as much as McAvoy is in his showiness. She makes Casey more than your typical horror heroine to root for, particularly with the help of quietly suspenseful flashbacks that indicate how she acquired her survival instincts. Her co-stars aren\u2019t afforded nearly as much characterization or clothing, for that matter. Advertisement But we also get a greater understanding of Kevin\u2019s mental state through the daily sessions he (or, rather, a version of him) schedules with his psychologist, Dr. Fletcher (an elegant and soulful Betty Buckley). A leading researcher in the field, she believes having dissociative identity disorder is actually a reflection of the brain\u2019s vast potential rather than a disability. Their conversations, while exquisitely tense, also provide a welcome source of kindness amid the brutality. And they help us put together the pieces of this puzzle\u2014which is actually a few different puzzles at once. There\u2019s the question of what Kevin wants with these girls. There\u2019s the question of how they\u2019ll escape. But the fundamentally frightening element of this whole scenario is how the various personalities interact with each other\u2014how they manipulate and intimidate each other\u2014and whether there\u2019s an even more fearsome force gaining strength. West Dylan Thordson\u2019s score and an expertly creepy sound design help make \u201cSplit\u201d an unsettling experience from the very start. But the movie staggers a bit toward the end with some contrivances and coincidences, and it goes in directions that feel a bit exploitative\u2014as if it\u2019s wringing childhood abuse for cheap thrills. I\u2019m still wrestling with how I feel about it, but I know I walked out with a slightly icky sense, even as I found the film engrossing both technically and dramatically. Still, it\u2019s exciting to see Shyamalan on such confident footing once more, all these years later. Make sure you stay in your seat until the absolute end to see what other tricks he may have up his sleeve."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Miss Stevens", "Review": "A low-key and intelligent character study, \u201cMiss Stevens\u201d\r\ndoesn\u2019t escape from its indie-film commonplaces often enough to become really\r\ndistinctive, but it has enough conscientiousness about its people that it\r\ndoesn\u2019t let the commonplaces fester into movie-sinking clich\u00e9s. Directed by\r\nJulia Hart (who scripted 2014\u2019s woman-centered Civil-War-set drama \u201cThe Keeping\r\nRoom\u201d) from a screenplay she co-wrote with Jordan Horowitz, it\u2019s an offhand\r\ntribute to teaching\u00ad\u2014its titular protagonist, played by Lily Rabe, is a\r\nhigh-school English teacher of obvious sensitivity, integrity and faith in her\r\ncalling. She\u2019s just having a tough time with, you know, life, and this picture\r\nworks to capture that in a purposeful way.  Advertisement The movie begins with the slight, attractive Rabe seated in\r\na theater, reluctant to leave after the lights have gone up. We find out what\u2019s\r\nthere for her, or rather what\u2019s not there, later on. Hart leaps headlong into\r\nMiss Stevens' weekend mission: to drive three students to an off-campus drama\r\ncompetition, where the kids will deliver monologues and perhaps bring home\r\nprizes that will get their school some arts funding. The kids are: the smart\r\nand slightly stuck-up Margot (Lili Reinhart) who on first impression seems to\r\nhave a little Tracy Flick in her; the openly-gay but not overtly theatrical\r\nabout it Sam (Anthony Quintal) and the troubled but also of course meteorically\r\ntalented Billy (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet). The road trip gets off to a rocky start as\r\nMargot criticizes Miss Stevens\u2019 taste in driving tunes, terming the stuff \u201cdad\r\nmusic.\u201d Billy digs it, and yes, this is one of those movies in which the\r\ncharacters bicker about a well-known pop tune and the filmmakers let you know\r\nwhere their loyalties lie by squelching the argument and letting the \u201cgood\r\npart\u201d of said tune play out at full volume on the soundtrack. I won\u2019t spoil the\r\nsong for you but it\u2019s not a favorite of mine.  By showing his affinity for Miss Stevens early on, Billy,\r\nwho\u2019s on meds and also is obliged to take a makeup exam some time over the\r\nweekend, first stakes his imaginary claim on her emotions. He figures they are\r\ntwo lonely people who can help each other, and Miss Stevens\u2019 possibly unwise\r\nconfession of a recent emotional episode eggs him on\u2014as does his unannounced\r\ndecision to get off those aforementioned meds. Much is made in contemporary art\r\nassessment of a creator\u2019s ostensible attitude toward his or her characters;\r\nspeculation on this topic is often irrelevant and/or stupid, but this movie\r\nmakes it plain that it truly likes its characters. One way it does so is in its\r\ndisinclination to get them into scrapes of any sort that are too uncomfortable\r\nor grotesque (this is arguably a more realistic approach as well, some might\r\nsay). All of which is to say that while Miss Stevens (Rachel to her\r\nnon-students) does make some bad\r\ndecisions (such as hooking up with a married male teacher played by Rob Huebel,\r\nwhose thirst for portraying schlubby cads seems unlikely to ever be slaked),\r\nshe insists on treating Bill as her student, and working things out with him\r\nthat way.  The film moves from scene to scene with a fluid ease, and\r\nthe acting is consistently winning and credible without ever being showy. While\r\nthe movie\u2019s unprepossessing manner can\u2019t be said to backfire, exactly, its\r\nmoments of wit and observation aren\u2019t sufficiently startling to lift it out of\r\nengaging amiability. Recommended to teachers who want a \u201cthis is what it\u2019s all\r\nabout\u201d smile or two."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Things We Lost in the Fire", "Review": "There is one man at the wake who doesn't seem to belong. Scruffy, unshaven, smoking, uncomfortable with himself, he draws aside from the affluent friends of the deceased. Yet he was the dead man's best friend. Jerry Sunborne (Benicio Del Toro) was never approved of by Audrey Burke (Halle Berry), the new widow, but she has invited him to the funeral all the same. She knows her husband would have wanted her to. As \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" opens, Audrey was married for 11 years to Brian Burke (David Duchovny, seen in several flashbacks), and they were happy years, giving her two children, now 10 and 6, and a big house in an upscale suburb. Brian was a \"genius\" at real estate deals, her lawyer tells her, and she has inherited a fortune. But her loneliness haunts her. In a way, it was Jerry's \"fault\" that her husband died, because he visited his friend's flophouse on his birthday and was killed in a senseless street crime while trying to stop a stranger from beating his wife. Advertisement But that was like Brian, being loyal to his friend and playing a good Samaritan. Jerry and Brian were friends from childhood; Jerry became a lawyer, and then a drug addict, and is now trying to get clean and sober at Narcotics Anonymous. And Audrey surprises herself by inviting him to come and live with them, in a room in the garage. No, she's not thinking of falling in love with Jerry -- far from it -- but she knows her husband would be pleased to see his friend in a safe place, and after all Audrey and Jerry loved Brian more than anyone else in the world. The film, directed by the talented Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier, centers on these two damaged people, who do not precisely help each other recover, but at least do not feel so alone. The screenplay by Allan Loeb is a first feature effort, but he has six more films in the works, including one announced by Ang Lee. Loeb is good at following the parallel advances and setbacks of his characters, and especially good at depicting how the children, 10-year-old Harper (Alexis Llewellyn) and 6-year-old Dory (Micah Berry, no relation), relate to the newcomer with resentment, then dependence, then uncertainty. The movie also accurately watches how a 12-step group works, especially in the character of the member Kelly (Alison Lohman), who keeps an eye on Jerry and alerts Audrey to a relapse. Another affecting supporting performance is by John Carroll Lynch, as a tactful neighbor who steers Jerry toward a real-estate agent's license. The key performance in the film is by Del Toro, who never overplays, who sidesteps any temptation to go over the top (especially in scenes of his suffering), and whose intelligence as a one-time lawyer shows through his street-worn new reality. He is puzzled and surprised that Audrey invites him into her home, but with his options, it's the best offer he'll ever receive. There is only one scene between them that is ill-advised, and indeed unbelievable, and you'll know the one I mean. Advertisement Bier has made two films I greatly admired, \"Open Hearts\" (2002) and \"Brothers\" (2005), but in her American debut she gets a little carried away with style, and especially with closeups, and very especially with closeups of eyes. I've never see this many great big eyes in a film: Berry's beautiful, Del Toro's bloodshot, the kids' twinkling or doubtful. The human face is the most fascinating subject for the camera, as Ingmar Bergman taught us, but its elements out of context can grow lonely. I suppose we could be dubious about a great beauty like Halle Berry seeming to be unaware of the strangeness of asking a heroin addict to live in her garage. But I accepted her decision as motivated by a correct reading of what her husband might have wanted her to do. That question settled, the movie is an engrossing melodrama, and it has its heart in the right place."}
{"Stars": 0.0, "Title": "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2", "Review": "Think of the worst movie you\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 a movie that didn\u2019t make you laugh, didn\u2019t make you cry, didn\u2019t move you or change you in any way besides giving you the desperate urge to flee the theater. Think of a movie that was a massive waste of your time and money. Hold that title in your mind. \u201cPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2\u201d is worse than that. This may sound like hyperbole or piling on. As of this writing, \u201cPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2\u201d is at zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes. (Mind you, Sony didn\u2019t screen it for critics before opening day, which is never a show of confidence, so the reviews are still trickling in.) But truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman\u2019s film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings. The jokes never land. The slapstick seems strained. The characters are one-dimensional. And the vague attempts at heart at the end don\u2019t feel earned. Advertisement This is essentially the same movie as the inexplicably successful original \u201cPaul Blart: Mall Cop,\u201d which made over $183 million worldwide in 2009. Only this time, Kevin James is even more unlikable as the title character. It seemed impossible when the first film came out that this endearing everyman could play a character that stripped him of all his best on-screen qualities. Back then, Paul Blart was just needy, clueless and annoying, as he\u00a0smugly\u00a0patrolled a New Jersey mall on his Segway. In the sequel, he\u2019s all of those things but he\u2019s also bitter, rude and condescending, which makes him even more repulsive. In theory, though, we\u2019re supposed to root for Paul as he takes a much-needed trip to Las Vegas for a security guard convention. In the proud tradition of so many recent Happy Madison productions\u2014\u201cJust Go With It\u201d (Hawaii), \u201cJack and Jill\u201d (cruise ship) \u201cBlended\u201d (Africa)\u2014\u201cPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2\u201d is a vacation disguised as a movie shoot. It\u2019s also an extended infomercial for the Wynn Las Vegas\u00a0hotel and\u00a0resort. (Steve Wynn himself makes an awkward, wordless cameo at the conclusion.) Paul is in need of a pick-me-up after a string of devastating losses, which are played for crass laughs. First, his love interest from the first film leaves him out of nowhere after just six days of marriage. But worse is the fate that befalls his sweet, dear mother (Shirley Knight), who dies when a milk truck runs over her in front of her house. (This is not a spoiler, folks\u2014it happens in the first few minutes. It\u2019s also supposed to be funny for some reason.) All Paul has left is his darling teenage daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez), of whom he\u2019s more psychotically overprotective than ever. So naturally, she can\u2019t tell her dad the good news that she got into UCLA. She has to withhold that information to provide the film with a forced source of tension. Maya also has to come with Paul to Las Vegas, where he\u2019s an uninspired clich\u00e9 of the tacky tourist with his loud shirts, tight shorts and cheap ways. But he carries himself with the swagger of a high roller when he gets the wrongheaded notion that he\u2019s the convention\u2019s keynote speaker. This includes talking down to the hotel\u2019s beautiful and polished general manager (Daniella Alonso), which makes her fall in love with him, naturally. Just as baffling is the quasi-romantic connection that occurs between Maya and one of the hotel\u2019s valet parking attendants (David Henrie), who seems to have all day to hang around with\u00a0her, take her for drinks poolside and invite her to a party in a swanky suite. Advertisement Now I\u2019m just nitpicking. There are much bigger problems here. The central premise of \u201cPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2\u201d is that Paul inadvertently thwarts a major heist of Wynn\u2019s famous art collection. The mastermind is the cool and crisply dressed Vincent (Neal McDonough, playing a generic bad guy, again), who has infiltrated the hotel\u2019s own security staff to pull off the crime. Paul throws himself into the action, literally, which results in a series of lame goofs, pratfalls and sight gags. These include a fight with an angry peacock (whom he totally provokes, by the way) and an overlong appearance in the Cirque du Soleil show \u201cLe Reve.\u201d In the process, he also must save Maya, who somehow managed to discover the scheme within the vast square footage of the Wynn hotel and fell into the villains\u2019 hands. For some reason, James likes this character, which must mean that he has zero recognition of his strengths as an actor at this point. He also co-wrote the script again with his longtime writing partner, Nick Bakay. Hopefully, they\u2019ll both realize that Paul Blart has collided face-first with every object imaginable\u00a0by now, and we can all call it a day."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Once", "Review": "I'm not at all surprised that my esteemed colleague Michael Phillips of the Tribune selected John Carney's \u201cOnce\u201d as the best film of 2007. I gave it my Special Jury Prize, which is sort of an equal first; no movie was going to budge \u201cJuno\u201d off the top of my list. \u201cOnce\u201d was shot for next to nothing in 17 days, doesn't even give names to its characters, is mostly music with not a lot of dialog, and is magical from beginning to end. It's one of those films where you hold your breath, hoping it knows how good it is, and doesn't take a wrong turn. Advertisement It doesn't. Even the ending is the right ending, the more you think about it. The film is set in Dublin, where we see a street musician singing for donations. This is the Guy (Glen Hansard). He attracts an audience of the Girl (Marketa Irglova). She loves his music. She's a pianist herself. He wants to hear her play. She doesn't have a piano. She takes him to a music store where she knows the owner, and they use a display piano. She plays some Mendelssohn. We are in love with this movie. He is falling in love with her. He just sits there and listens. She is falling in love with him. She just sits there and plays. There is an unusual delay before we get the obligatory reaction shot of the store owner, because all the movie wants to do is sit there and listen, too. This is working partly because of the deeply good natures we sense these two people have. They aren't \u201cpicking each other up.\u201d They aren't flirting \u2014 or, well, technically they are, but in that way that means, \u201cI'm not interested unless you're too good to be true.\u201d They love music, and they're not faking it. We sense to a rare degree the real feelings of the two of them; there's no overlay of technique, effect or style.  They are just purely and simply themselves. Hansard is a professional musician, well known in Ireland as leader of a band named the Frames. Irglova is an immigrant from the Czech Republic, only 17 years old, who had not acted before. She has the kind of smile that makes a man want to be a better person, so he can deserve being smiled at. The film develops their story largely in terms of song. In between, they confide their stories. His heart was broken because his girlfriend left him and moved to London. She takes him home to meet her mother, who speaks hardly any English, and to join three neighbors who file in every night to watch their TV.  And he meets her child, which comes as a surprise. Then he finds out she's married. Another surprise, and we sense that in his mind he had already dumped the girl in London and was making romantic plans. He's wounded, but brave. He takes her home to meet his dad, a vacuum cleaner repairman. She has a Hoover that needs fixing. It's Kismet. Advertisement He wants to record a demo record, take it to London, and play it for music promoters. She helps him, and not just by playing piano. When it comes down to it, she turns out to be level-headed, decisive, take-charge. An ideal producer. They recruit other street musicians for a session band, and she negotiates a rock-bottom price for a recording studio. And so on. All with music. And all with their love, and our love for their love, only growing. At one point he asks if she still loves her husband, and she answers in Czech, and the movie doesn't subtitle her answer, because if she'd wanted subtitles, she would have answered in English, which she speaks perfectly well. \u201cOnce\u201d is the kind of film I've been pestered about ever since I started reviewing again. People couldn't quite describe it, but they said I had to see it. I had to. Well, I did. They were right."}

Between all the \r\norigin stories, the sequels, the spinoffs, the spoofs and the too-soon \r\nreboots, I have had my fill of big-name actors in ridiculous outfits allowing their stunt doubles or digital stand-ins to save the world.  When\r\n even a Denzel Washington action flick like \u201cThe Equalizer\u201d plays like a\r\n start-up entry in a comic-book franchise, matters are getting out of \r\nhand. Advertisement Of\r\n course, such a break in the crash-boom action would at this point \r\nprobably cause the ruination of the movie business as we know it. No \r\nless than 24 new titles are slated for the next six years. Studios might be forced to come up with \r\nsome fresh ideas that aren\u2019t already known quantities pre-packaged as a \r\nbrand. That is, once they run out of YA novels to adapt for the screen. Which\r\n is why I was chagrined to learn that Disney, which has been nicely \r\nre-establishing itself as animation powerhouse beyond its Pixar label \r\nafter the success of \u201cWreck-It Ralph\u201d and \u201cFrozen,\u201d was digging into the\r\n Marvel vault for toon-worthy material. As a result, my expectations were low for \u201cBig Hero 6,\u201d\r\n based on an obscure comic book with a Japanese manga sensibility that \r\nintroduces yet another makeshift gang of warriors. In other words, the \r\ndreaded origin story. \r\n Much to my surprise, it didn\u2019t take long to warm to this tale set in \r\nthe gleaming near-futuristic metropolis known as San Fransokyo where \r\ntrolley cars and an Asian-infused Golden Gate Bridge happily co-exist \r\nwith dumpling emporiums and Tokyo-inspired skyscrapers. And how could I \r\nresist when, early on, a kick-ass gal is heard commanding a guy to \u201cStop\r\n whining! Woman up!\u201d\u00a0  I also was taken from the outset by the 14-year-old hero\r\n actually named Hiro (engagingly voiced by Ryan Potter), an overly cocky\r\n punk who already has his high-school diploma. He is right on trend \r\nwith other troubled misfit geniuses in films this fall including those \r\nin \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d and \u201cThe Theory of Everything.\u201d Initially, the \r\nscrawny lad invests his smarts into winning back-alley robot fights with\r\n deceptively simple electronic toys of his own design.  But\r\n after Hiro has a brush with the law, older brother Tadashi (Daniel \r\nHenney) invites him to check out his college\u2019s robotics lab with \r\nthoughts of enrolling. There he meets an A-team of tech specialists: \r\nadrenaline junkie Go Go Tomago (Jamie Chung, the source of the above \r\n\u201dWoman up!\u201d remark); upbeat chemistry whiz Honey Lemon (Genesis \r\nRodriguez); cautious neat-freak Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.); and fanboy \r\nsidekick Fred, a sort of nerd answer Scooby-Doo pal Shaggy (T.J.

Then tragedy strikes after a fire traps and kills both Tadashi \r\nand Prof. Callaghan (James Cromwell), who was going to be Hiro\u2019s \r\nmentor. With no parents and his brother gone, Hiro retreats into his \r\nbedroom in the apartment above a coffee shop run by his worrywart Aunt \r\nCass (Maya Rudolph).\u00a0  \u201cBig Hero 6\u201d truly achieves liftoff, however, when Hiro happens upon Baymax, Tadashi\u2019s invention, who is the perfect fill-in as a big brother. A really big\r\n brother who is so viscerally huggable, you can practically squish him \r\nwith your eyes. Imagine a white 10-foot-tall inflatable robot programmed\r\n to tend to the sick who is a cross between the Michelin Man, the Stay \r\nPuft marshmallow character from \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and a futon mattress. A\r\n calm in any storm, Baymax is dedicated to easing pain of all sorts and \r\ncertainly performs that function for a grieving Hiro. He also has a \r\ngreat sense of physical humor not unlike such plus-size comics as John \r\nCandy and John Belushi as he gingerly squeezes in and out of tight spots\r\n or stumbles about as if drunk when his battery is low. Even his attempt\r\n at a fist bump is an ingenious running gag. However,\r\n there is the rest of the plot to deal with and, if you haven\u2019t \r\nguessed, Hiro along with a soon souped-up\u00a0 Baymax and the four lab \r\ngeeks form a crew of avengers. Their mission is to seek a mysterious \r\nKabuki-mask-wearing baddie suspected of setting the inferno as well as \r\nstealing Hiro\u2019s invention. There are sundry loud action sequences but \r\nnone are as thrilling as the sight of Hiro and a now-aerodynamic Baymax \r\nforming a bond similar to that of Hiccup and Toothless in \"How to Train \r\nYour Dragon\" as they soar hither and yon above the urban sprawl. \u201cBig Hero 6\u201d\r\n becomes increasingly more predictable in its final half hour as it \r\nmakes a few stabs at a surprise twist or two. This is no \u201cThe \r\nIncredibles,\u201d Pixar\u2019s dysfunctional-family version of a superhero saga, \r\nwhen it comes to originality. Baymax is great but he\u2019s no Edna Mode.

An action adventure that puts brain ahead of \r\nbrawn as a valued commodity is always reason to celebrate. Add in the \r\nconsiderable heart that Baymax contributes (with elements borrowed from \r\nboth \u201cWALL-E\u201d and \u201cUp\u201d), and you have a winner.\u00a0  Advertisement Stay\r\n until the very end of the credits if you want to see a reveal about \r\nFred\u2019s parentage.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Now You See Me", "Review": "Louis Leterrier\u2019s directorial debut, \"The Transporter,\" was the movie that established Jason Statham as an action star. It was also an important early hit for EuropaCorp, the French studio that kickstarted the careers of Pierre Morel (\"Taken\"), Olivier Megaton (\"Colombiana,\" \"Taken 2\"), and actor / director Guillame Canet (\"Tell No One\"). After helming two more movies for EuropaCorp \u2014 \"Unleashed\" and \"Transporter 2\" \u2014 Leterrier decamped to Hollywood, where he ended up directing the leaden, mega-budgeted movies \"The Incredible Hulk\" and \"Clash of the Titans,\" the latter of which he has since disowned. Advertisement Leterrier\u2019s new film, \"Now You See Me,\" is in some ways a return to his roots. Like his two \"Transporter\" movies, it\u2019s light on seriousness and heavy on style \u2014 a razzle-dazzle fantasy about a team of bank-robbing illusionists. It\u2019s slick, deliberately silly, and sprinkled with visual confetti \u2014 Steadicam spins, lens flares, CGI trick shots. The movie opens by introducing the four leads: a cocky street magician (Jesse Eisenberg); his former assistant (Isla Fisher), whose solo act focuses on gory stunts; a once-famous mentalist (Woody Harrelson) who's been reduced to using cold reading and hypnosis to shake down people for cash; and a sleight-of-hand artist (Dave Franco, brother of James) who moonlights as a pickpocket. A hoodie-wearing stranger slips each of them a Tarot card inscribed with a date and a New York address. Flash forward to Las Vegas a year later, where the four now perform as a headlining act called the Four Horsemen. For their big finale, they present a complicated illusion where a random audience member appears to be teleported into the vault of his bank. The audience member is told to turn on the vault's ventilation system, which sucks up a palette of Euros; a few seconds later, the bills rain down over the audience. The crowd goes wild. The next day, the magicians are brought in for questioning by the FBI; it seems the audience member's bank has been robbed, and a prop used in the magic act has been found at the scene. Soon, the magicians are being investigated by a surly agent (Mark Ruffalo) and an Interpol detective (M\u00e9lanie Laurent); they know the Four Horsemen are involved in the crime, but can't figure out how. Also on the Four Horsemen's trail is a smug ex-magician (Morgan Freeman) who has made a fortune revealing the secrets behind well-known illusions. Freeman can make the clunkiest exposition sound good (see: Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, or the recent \"Oblivion\"); for the most part, that's what he's here to do. Turning Freeman into the movie's de facto on-camera narrator is \"Now You See Me\"'s neatest trick, especially since much of the movie's third act revolves around tweaking his all-knowing screen persona.  Advertisement There is, of course, an explanation for the heist \u2014 and it isn't \"magic\" \u2014 but said explanation doesn't so much strain credibility as negate it. \"Now You See Me\" is proudly outlandish; the Four Horsemen's methods \u2014 which involve giant mirrors, doubles, hypnosis, copious amounts of flash paper, and, uh, holograms \u2014 are as logic-defying as their tricks. Had the movie ended by simply revealing that the four were wizards, it would be more believable. That, however, wouldn't be as fun. Much of what makes \"Now You See Me\" so entertaining \u2014 in a gaudy, disposable, Vegas act sort of way \u2014 is its ever-escalating ridiculousness. After the bank job, the Four Horsemen go on a series on ever-more-complicated heists, which turn them into fugitives and folk heroes. The movie, which began as \"just\" a bank-robbing magician story, eventually becomes a narrative Rube Goldberg contraption; conspiracies, secret identities, decades-old vendettas, and occult brotherhoods are involved. The second half of the movie is effectively one long, protracted chase, with Ruffalo and Laurent always a few steps behind the Four Horsemen. It's here that Leterrier seems to really be in his element; a lengthy fight scene where Franco fends off FBI agents using throwing cards and sleight-of-hand tricks is as poppy and kinetic as anything in \"The Transporter.\" Like the EuropaCorp movies that started Leterrier's career, \"Now You See Me\" emphasizes cinematography over just about everything else, including narrative sense. Unusually, it has two directors of photography, both of whom are specialists in flashy, special-effects-ready extravagance: Mitchell Amundsen (\"Transformers,\" \"Wanted\") and Larry Fong (\"Super 8,\" as well as the Zack Snyder movies \"300,\" \"Watchmen\" and \"Sucker Punch\"). Just as unusually \u2014 at least for an effects-heavy production \u2014 it's shot on celluloid with anamorphic lenses. This gives the movie a retro visual texture and a more classical sense of widescreen space; the trade-off is that the digital effects look less convincing than they would in a digitally-shot movie. However, in a film where nothing is supposed to be credible, mediocre CGI seems appropriate. It\u2019s not meant to seem realistic, so why should it look real?"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Pawn Sacrifice", "Review": "Although Edward Zwick's \"Pawn Sacrifice\" has the great virtue of centering on expert performances by a cast including Tobey Maguire, Liev Schreiber and Peter Sarsgaard, it ends up as a sad example of the inherent difficulties of dramatizing a cerebral face-off like the 1972 battle royale between chess masters Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. No doubt the subject here could make for a strong film. It certainly did in \"Bobby Fischer Against the World,\" Liz Garbus' justly acclaimed 2011 nonfiction account of the same material. The latest proof that some real-life incidents come across more dramatically when treated as documentaries rather than fact-based fiction, Zwick's film effectively poses the question of why viewers should care about a chess match that riveted the world more than 40 years ago. Advertisement The answer to that may well depend on the viewer's age. Zwick includes generous dollops from the U.S. network news coverage of the Fischer-Spassky confrontation in Reykjavik, Iceland, footage that will perhaps carry a nostalgic charge for baby boomers who recall how the match was treated not just as a sports event but as a symbolic showdown between the ideologies represented by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. For filmgoers too young to remember the fraught tensions of the Cold War, however, these same antique newsreels may seem like little more than dimensionless historical curiosities.\u00a0 In rather formulaic fashion, Steven Knight's screenplay starts off with certain tense moments before the big game begins, then flashes back to show how the characters got there. The result is that the film's first hour is devoted to a biopic-style chronicle of Fischer's early life, in which we learn that Bobby (played as a youngster by Aiden Lovekamp and Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) had a loose-cannon Communist mom (Robin Weigert) who refused to tell him who his real dad was, but established his chess skills early under the tutelage of a generous mentor named Carmine Nigro (Conrad Pla). One of the jarring oddities of this section of the film is that it's supposed to take place in New York, but when we see an al fresco chess rendezvous that's labeled \"Washington Square Park,\" it is transparently NOT that world-famous location. Sure, we know that budgetary constraints oblige many U.S.-set films to shoot in Canada, but then why not leave out the label and allow viewers to assume that this is some other park? In any case, Montreal here plays not only New York but, even more improbably, Santa Monica. Advertisement The latter city is where Fischer (now played by Maguire) has his first battle with Russian chess ace Spassky (Schreiber). Prior to this, we've seen how the brash young prodigy has already emerged as a media celebrity and forged a precocious career path with the help of lawyer Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Catholic priest William Lombardy (Sarsgaard), a chess master who served as his teacher. As he does throughout, Zwick treats Fischer's late-60s trip to California with all manner of cinematic clich\u00e9s: We see oodles of grainy footage of surfers and their chicks on the beach and other flashes of the sun 'n' fun lifestyle, not that this has anything to do with the chess competition that takes place entirely indoors. Most annoyingly, the filmmakers lamely try to conjure the era by repeatedly blasting period rock 'n' roll hits on the soundtrack. Even fans of this music are likely to concur that it has been used for such purposes far too often in movies. In any case, gobs of musical pep do nothing to make the slow and arcane processes of chess more accessible. Rather oddly, Zwick doesn't even show the Santa Monica match between Fischer and Spassky. We simply see the result, which has the feel of dramatic contrivance: Fischer, the loser, screams inchoately as his puzzled nemesis emerges from an early morning swim in the ocean. Once the scene switches to Iceland in the film's second hour, we've clearly gotten the message that Fischer is a nut job. But filmgoers are likely to consider this a blessing since it accounts for much of what entertainment value the climactic match holds. Even if we don't care that Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger are watching in the White House (among countless nudges we're given as to the event's geopolitical significance), and despite the unavoidably truncated and opaque way the games are presented, there's some amusement in seeing Fischer insisting that the play be moved to a small rec room away from the big hall's noises and distractions, a bit of craziness that eventually unhinges the favored Spassky. By this time in his life, Fischer (who was Jewish) was already into the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that marred his public persona long after his days in the sports limelight had waned. While Zwick and company do nothing to explain this bizarre mania, \"Pawn Sacrifice\" definitely conjures the feeling of it, thanks in large part to the movie's greatest asset: Maguire's edgy, charismatic performance."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "XXY", "Review": "Alex was born with both male and female sex organs. Although \"reassignment\" surgery was considered after birth, she has lived as a woman until the age of 15, when \"XXY\" takes up the story. She uses hormones to subdue her male characteristics, but now she has become unsure how she really feels. Alex is neither a man in a woman's body, nor a woman in a man's body, but both, in the body of a high-spirited tomboy who broods privately in uncertainty and confusion. Hermaphrodite is no longer the P.C. term for such people, who prefer \"intersex,\" although it seems to me that they are not so much between the sexes as encompassing both of them. Their stories are often exploited in lurid, sensationalistic accounts. Lucia Puenzo's \"XXY\" is the first film that I've seen on the subject that is honest and sensitive -- indeed, the only one. It is not a message picture, never lectures, contains partial nudity but avoids explicit images and grows into a poignant human drama. It will be described in terms of Alex's sexual ambiguity, but that would simplify it, and this is not a simple film but a subtle and observant one. (\"XXY\" won the top prize in Critics' Week at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Advertisement Alex (Ines Efron) is the child of a Marine biologist named Kraken (Ricardo Darin) and his wife, Suli (Valeria Bertuccelli). They have moved their family from Argentina to an island off the shore of Uruguay, where Kraken can study specimens and Alex can grow up more privately. That has not been easy. \"I'm sick of doctors and changing schools,\" she tells her mother. Since other kids somehow sense something strange about her, she cannot easily keep her secret. Recently she has stopped taking hormones. Perhaps (Alex never says) it will be easier to account for a penis if she does not live as a girl. Guests arrive on the island: A plastic surgeon named Ramiro (German Palacios), his wife, Erika (Carolina Peleritti), and their son, Alvaro (Martin Piroyanski), who's about Alex's age. Suli has invited them so the doctor can \"get to know\" Alex and tells her husband she has not told them about their child's secret. Alex and Alvaro are attracted to each other, and together have what is possibly the first sexual experience for either. This is shown with great dramatic impact, but not with graphic intimacy; the point is not what they do, but how they feel about it. The film gives full weight to all of the characters. When Kraken first saw his newborn infant, \"I thought she was perfect.\" He wants to give Alex the right to make her own decision about having surgery. His wife thinks Alex's penis should be removed, but is not shrill or insistent. Both in their different ways love and care for their child. In contrast, the surgeon is brutally cruel in a conversation with his own son, who may possibly be starting to realize he is gay and may be attracted to the androgynous Alex for that reason. Alex and Alvaro sense some sort of unstated, even unconscious, common bond. Meanwhile, there are problems on the island. Alex has broken the nose of her boyfriend, possibly (I'm not sure) because he wanted to explore her body. And local teenagers chase Alex on the beach and pin her down to settle the mystery of her physiology. Advertisement I am making the film sound too melodramatic. The shots are beautifully composed, the editing paces the process of self-discovery, the dialogue is spare and heartfelt, the performances are deeply human -- especially by Efron, who I learn was 22 when the film was made, but never looks it. Nor does she look too distractingly male or female, and so is convincing as both. The film accumulates its force through many small moments and some larger ones. It assembles its story as a careful novelist might, out of many precise, significant brushstrokes. And Efron finds a sure line through the pitfalls of her role, succeeding in playing not girl or boy, but -- Alex.  We understand that Alex is in despair, and we see it reflected in a sketchbook she has drawn. She is weary of being poked and prodded by the unhealthy curiosity of society, weary of being considered a freak. Alex wants to be accepted as herself but is not sure who that is. In wanting her to find happiness, her parents provide a refuge, even though they hardly even discuss her intersexuality with her in so many words. And finally that's why this film can avoid a \"solution\" and yet end with a bittersweet glow."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Roseanne for President!", "Review": "While watching \u201cRoseanne\u00a0for President!,\u201d I kept wishing that somehow a brassy and sassy human bulldozer like sitcom queen\u00a0Roseanne\u00a0Barr\u2014who made a legit run for the Oval Office in 2012\u2014could face off with blowhard Donald Trump in a debate. I certainly would pay good money to witness her mighty mouth shred the GOP\u2019s Great Orange Hope as if he were the final verse of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest buying a movie ticket to see this ragtag though fairly amusing documentary about the entertainer\u2019s attempt to become the Green Party\u2019s presidential nominee against Jill Stein, a physician by trade whose passive-aggressive demure nature while dealing with her opponent is as un-Trump-ish as you can get. Advertisement VOD seems to be a more appropriate fit, since the Hawaii-based Barr herself preferred to attend most of her whistle stops from the comfort of her home via Skype. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fly there like some candidates,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat\u2019s not the Green way,\u201d citing the waste of fossil fuel. But then Barr, in her own inimitably candid fashion, suggests the real reason: \u201cI hate to be around people and touch them or any of that. Plus, the fear that there is going to be weirdos that want to kill me.\u201d The stand-up comic who popularized the term \u201cdomestic goddess\u201d had a way of undermining her own clout as a TV pioneer whose hit series \u201cRoseanne,\u201d which ran nine seasons 1988-97, provided one of the rare sitcom portrayals of a two-income working-class family struggling to make ends meet while also making inroads for gay characters.\u00a0 Being notoriously undiplomatic and aggressively outspoken formed the foundation of her comedy\u2014she probably was the first humorist to crack a joke about a Maxi Pad\u2014but that persona didn\u2019t always translate when she was not performing. Similarly, this underdog is at her best here when she is onstage, shouting \u201cPower to the people!\u201d and emphasizing that \u201cI\u2019m not running as a publicity stunt since my political views pretty much ended my career anyway.\u201d Indeed, in the course of her campaign, a pilot for a new TV show is rejected. In the biographical portions of the doc, Barr revels in her hard-knock life and outsider status, including the fact she grew up as a Jew among the Mormon majority of Salt Lake City, Utah, and spent eight months in a state-run mental institution after suffering brain injuries in a car crash at age 16. But offering excuses for not making an effort to connect to people in person\u2014she would rather tap someone\u2019s shoulder than ever shake their hand\u2014is no way to win votes. But Barr, who has the on-camera support of such name backers as Michael Moore, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Tom Smothers, was summoned to join the race by the Green Party\u2019s Cynthia McKinney, a black woman who was a Democratic representative from Georgia for six terms before embarking on her own third-party run for president in 2008. McKinney, who realizes it isn\u2019t always easy being Green, is well aware of the powerful effect that celebrity has in a public arena and realizes the potential value of Barr\u2019s presence. Still, the funny lady is better at zinging quips than defining her Socialist agenda. The legalization of marijuana looms large\u2014Barr is seen inhaling joints filled with her prescription-brand weed, even while driving her car as a police vehicle passes by\u2014and relishes the chance to upset the status quo of the two-party system. She pays lip-service to a single-payer universal health-care system and berates Wall Street bankers regularly, going so far as to say they deserve to face the guillotine. Ultimately, Barr ends up as the Peace and Freedom Party\u2019s candidate, after losing to Stein, and actually collects a small yet not inconsiderable amount of votes. Spoiler alert: She didn\u2019t win. But what can you expect when she starts off the doc by saying, \u201cWhat matters isn\u2019t that I win or lose. It\u2019s that I have the freedom to be on the ballot\u201d? Advertisement Obviously, this isn\u2019t exactly a totally serious investigation of what it feels to be a non-traditional candidate, not surprising when you realize that Barr is the film\u2019s executive producer and that one of Moore\u2019s cohorts, Eric Weinrib, is the director. What is unexpected is that Barr allows herself to be upstaged by her humble and dedicated campaign manager Farheen Hakeem.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "21 Jump Street", "Review": "Here's the last movie I was expecting with this title. In other words, \"21 Jump Street\" is pretty good. There seemed to be little demand for a movie spinoff of the crime drama that ran on Fox from 1987 to 1991, and which had an early starring role for Johnny Depp. Perhaps realizing that, the filmmakers have abandoned any pretense of being faithful to the series, and turned to a mashup of screwball comedy, action and \"The Odd Couple\" formula. The couple here are Schmidt and Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum), who were opposites in high school and still are eight years later. In high school, Schmidt was a pudgy nerd who wore braces and couldn't get his mouth to work while trying to ask a girl to the prom. Jenko was a good-looking jock to whom all things came easily; unfortunately, he was the dim bulb in the chandelier.  Advertisement In a brief prologue, the movie spares us the tiresome routine where the jock makes life miserable for the nerd; all he does is snicker with everyone else when poor Schmidt gets tongue-tied. They have no reason to be enemies, because they're from different planets. When we meet them again, they're both in the police academy, where Schmidt aces all the exams and fails everything physical, and Jenko does the opposite. That makes them both misfits, and they feel a growing camaraderie.  After an unpromising start as bicycle-riding cops on park patrol, they're exiled to an undercover unit investigating a dangerous new drug infiltrating a local high school. The captain in charge (Ice Cube) is the typical police veteran who can't believe the incompetence of these losers. I should mention that his name is Dickson \u2014 inevitable in a movie papered with dick jokes. The male member, having gone unmentioned during most of the cinema's first 110 years, now co-stars in many comedies. But back to the story. It often strikes me that the actors in high school movies look too old. But Schmidt and Jenko look really too old, and the movie isn't shy about pointing that out. Indeed, one of the pleasures of \"21 Jump Street\" is that the screenplay by Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill is happy to point out all of its improbabilities; the premise is preposterous to begin with, and they run with that. Jonah Hill, nominated for an Oscar for \"Moneyball,\" has become a movie star by demonstrating that it's not so much how you look as how well you look it. He has an endearing appeal in early scenes where he uses close-cropped blond hair in a pathetic attempt to look cool. Hill lost a lot of weight to appear in this movie, but he's one of those guys who will never be described as thin. Channing Tatum, however, has a reverse handicap: He's improbably handsome and has a (real) name that sounds manufactured by a press agent. Their attempt to pass themselves off as brothers supplies a running gag. There might have been a temptation to write Schmidt and Jenko as rivals, but it's more effective here to develop them as friends who screw up together. They were pre-enrolled by Capt. Dickson in hand-picked classes, but trouble starts when they can't remember their undercover names and are assigned to each other's classes. That means Schmidt ends up playing Peter Pan in drama class, and Jenko is in advanced chemistry.  Apparently the conviction that we got high school all wrong is universal. Now Schmidt and Jenko get a fresh start, and Schmidt even gets another chance to ask a girl (sweet Brie Larson) to the prom. Meanwhile, they're seeking the source of drugs in the high school, which inevitably involves chase scenes and a motorcycle gang including a fat bald guy with high-rider handlebars. As usual, the chases and explosions are boring.  A disastrous party with abuse is funny, as the movie uses bizarre graphics to illustrate the various stages users go through while using the new mystery drug. What it all comes down to is a funnier and sweeter movie than I had any way of expecting, and the debut of Channing Tatum as an actor who can play comedy. He deadpans so well here he might start looking at Cary Grant movies for remake ideas. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Sex Tape", "Review": "Three years ago, Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel co-starred for director Jake Kasdan in \"Bad Teacher\" and had an enjoyable, raunchy chemistry. She was the bad teacher of the film\u2019s title: a drunken vixen who was only working with children because she needed money for a boob job. He was the irreverent, easygoing gym teacher who saw through her flaws and schemes and wanted to hang out with her anyway. It was a one-joke movie, but there were enough shadings and variations within that one joke to make it somewhat fun. Advertisement Now, Diaz and Segel co-star for Kasdan again in \u201cSex Tape,\u201d but their characters are so indiscernible as actual human beings, it\u2019s hard to tell who they are, much less whether they have any sort of enjoyable, raunchy chemistry. She\u2019s a married, stay-at-home mother of two who writes a blog about her family, and that\u2019s about it. He\u2019s her husband, who works at a radio station in some capacity, maybe...? They make a sex tape to spice up their formerly frisky marriage and it accidentally goes public. It\u2019s a one-joke movie that feels like a one-joke movie.  It\u2019s a high-concept premise that ends up being preposterous and riddled with plot holes, and the way these fools fling themselves into an all-night, madcap adventure to right their wrong is painfully strained and unfunny. Also, the whole notion of making a sex tape and then being ashamed of it seems sort of quaint at this point\u2014as if everyone involved missed the zeitgeist for maximum relevance and edginess about five years ago. High-tech devices to create quality, do-it-yourself cinema surround us more than ever, as we well know. Nowhere is this more true than in \u201cSex Tape,\u201d which is essentially one long commercial for Apple products wrapped in a toothless, feel-good comedy about a longtime married couple reconnecting. It\u2019s amazing, the quality of the camera on the iPad that\u2019s propped securely on top of the laundry basket as Diaz\u2019s Annie and Segel\u2019s Jay re-enact every single pose in the iconic \u201870s tome \"The Joy of Sex.\"\u00a0And wow\u2014the Cloud! It\u2019s so powerful as it sucks in every last blip of digital information in ways no one could possibly understand (including the people who made this movie).  Things were simpler back when Annie and Jay were young. We first meet the couple in college, cavorting like bunny rabbits anywhere and everywhere. This is their primary personality trait: They like having sex with each other. Or at least, they did. Cut to 10 years later (which would make Diaz 32 when she\u2019s actually almost 42, which I know because we have the same exact birthday, but whatever, it\u2019s a minor distraction). They still love and desire each other, but between work, kids, school, house, etc., they just don\u2019t have the same time or energy to maul each other the way they once did. It happens. Advertisement When Annie sends the kids to Grandma\u2019s house for the night, she and Jay try to use the opportunity to get their freak on, but they initially fumble. A few tequila shots later, though, and they\u2019re starring in their own homemade porn video. Diaz and Segel get super naked and seem game for every goofy move that comes their way, but there\u2019s something stiff (if you\u2019ll pardon the pun) about the way Kasdan stages these scenes and about Segel\u2019s performance in general. He\u2019s noticeably slimmed down and toned up since he famously went full-frontal in 2008\u2019s \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\" But he also seems to have lost the loose, amiable puppy-dog quality that made him so appealing. He\u2019s so oddly inert here, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s been encased in wax. Jay promises he\u2019ll erase the video, but not only does he forget to do that, he also inadvertently sends it to a bunch of people through a new syncing app. In one of the many contrived plot devices that keep this effort rumbling along, Jay has a habit of giving old iPads to friends and relatives as gifts. So now all these people have access to their antics, which lasted three hours. (\"Sex Tape\" itself feels that long, even though it\u2019s only about 90 minutes.) The script from Segel, his longtime friend and collaborator Nicholas Stoller and Kate Angelo (\"The Back-Up Plan\") finds Annie and Jay scurrying all over Los Angeles to scoop up these tablets before anyone sees the movie. Well, anyone else, that is\u2014at least one person has seen it and is sending Jay anonymous, cryptic texts in a subplot that feels forced. Jay keeps making bad decisions, Annie keeps getting annoyed with him. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper, who play the couple\u2019s best friends, go along for the ride but mostly go to waste.  The whole process is extremely tedious, but one of their stops\u2014which amounts to an extended detour\u2014is so random and unexpected that it breathes much-needed life into the film. Annie and Jay visit the lavish mansion of Hank Rosenbaum (Rob Lowe), the cardigan-wearing CEO of the family-friendly company that\u2019s on the verge of paying big money for Annie\u2019s blog. (Another detail that seems distractingly impossible.) Inexplicably, Annie has given Hank her iPad, so she has to knock on his door and distract him while Jay searches for the device. Advertisement The casting of Lowe, who notoriously suffered his own sex-tape scandal in the late 1980s, at first seems like an in-joke that\u2019s too easy. But the more his character reveals himself\u2014and a complexity that\u2019s sadly lacking in everyone else\u2014the more you realize how cleverly it taps into Lowe\u2019s longtime chops as a standout supporting player.  I won\u2019t give away what happens between Diaz and Lowe, but I will say that this is the actor with whom she has real chemistry\u2014and this is the shocking video you\u2019ll really want to see."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Deception", "Review": "What can compare with the white-knuckle suspense of uploading a file? \"Deception,\" that's what. This is a movie jam-packed with all the thrills of watching that little progress bar grow and grow until it fills the alloted space in the pop-up box on your computer screen. The most thrilling sequence in the movie actually does involve a race between a disconnect countdown and a file upload on accountant Ewan McGregor's IBM laptop. If you had a lot of rhythmic, percussive music blaring away while you were transferring files on your laptop, you might find it exciting, too. But maybe not. Advertisement \"Deception\" -- which, deceptively, has been tracked under such aliases as \"The List,\" \"The Tourist,\" \"Manipulation\" (in France) and \"Untitled Hugh Jackman Project\" -- ostensibly trades in the title commodity. Meek, bespectacled auditor Jonathan McQuarry (as in McVictim, played by McGregor) meets suave, predatory lawyer Wyatt Bose (Jackman) in a conference room late one night while the office cleaning lady and the office cleaning gentleman sneak off into the men's restroom to polish each other's linoleum. \"Are you working late or are you downloading a multitude of porn?\" Wyatt asks, unidiomatically. Are square-jawed big-city lawyers really this inarticulate? Perhaps it is a clue that he is not who he doesn't quite seem. Wyatt whips out a joint, and the unlikely new best friends smoke away the best evening Jonathan claims to have had since he saw Van Halen in '87. Before he lets that one slip, he confesses that he likes the order and symmetry of numbers, yet he sometimes looks out the high-rise glass windows of whatever firm he's auditing and he sees \"life literally passing me by.\" Accountants and their metaphors: They will not be stopped! Soon Wyatt and Jonathan are hanging together at the gym (mixed doubles, anyone?) and visiting clubs where plasticine hookers wear looking-glass eyes ... while straddling ladders and cozying up to brass poles to the steady throb of medum-volume techno-lite muzak. (In the movies, all clubs play this gaudy music so you'll know lewd sex is available -- and that the characters are willing endure excruciatingly banal synth tracks in order to get some. If the music is any good, wanton sex is unobtainable.) Advertisement But when Jonathan accidentally picks up Wyatt's cell phone after an intimate lunch in the park, he finds himself on a do-call list that would be the envy of every nascent Eliot Spitzer. Hot Wall Street babes begin calling him (well, really Wyatt) for anonymous sex at snazzy New York hotels. Oh, why not? Once he gets into the groove and gets Charlotte Rampling to explain the very simple rules to him (\"No rough stuff and no names\"), he takes to sexual moonlighting like a whore to culture. If you check out the definition of the word \"deception\" in a dictionary, you'll find that it involves duplicity, a ruse, a trick. And therein lies the trouble with this movie. O, \"Deception,\" where is thy deceit? Do you believe that Hugh Jackman is terrifying and sinister, and that Ewan McGregor is as timid as a wee fluffy bunny until he starts mating like one? The plot may say \"yes,\" but your gut probably says \"no.\" You see it on the screen, the story insists it's happening, but you do not believe it for a second. Indeed, \"Deception\" contains not one credible moment. Not one. Not a line, a gesture, a look, a staging, a situation, a location. Nothing. Even Madrid is unconvincing as itself -- and it's Madrid! Likewise, the movie's New York is as lovely as the women in the montage sequences, but they all look artificial, although they are gorgeously photographed by Dante Spinotti (\"Heat\" (1995), \"L.A. Confidential,\" \"The Insider\"). Stanley Kubrick had solid aesthetic reasons for making sex and the city look dreamlike and unreal in \"Eyes Wide Shut.\" Here the flashing breasts are as carefully exposed as the lighted windows in the skyscrapers. They're fleetingly pretty, but are supplied for decoration only. Long after \"Deception\" should have been over, the \"twists\" keep on coming. Most memorable is a transition from a closeup of a plastic wind-up duckie to a long shot of a seagull. That one I did not see coming. Everything else is equally risible, made all the more so by the filmmakers' determination to nail down every last painstakingly delineated plot point while ignoring the great black holes of story and characterization that long ago rendered it all so very pointless."}

The book is a collection of 22 short stories connected by the character George Willard, who comes of age there and reflects on the citizens he has grown to know.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Brand New Testament", "Review": "Catherine Deneuve romancing a gorilla. That\u2019s one of the head-scratching curiosities in \u201cThe Brand New Testament,\u201d Belgian director Jaco Van Dormael\u2019s goof on the Bible. Is pairing the French screen goddess with the big hairy guy from the zoo a funny conceit? That depends on your sense of humor. For this reviewer, Van Dormael\u2019s film was pure torture from first to last, about as mirthless a comedy as I ever hope to see.   But I\u2019m guessing mine is a minority opinion. The movie was well-received when it debuted at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and has won \u201cbest film\u201d prizes in a number of European film festivals. So presumably some folks find it screamingly funny. All of which underscores the truism that humor is largely subjective. Advertisement   If ever there was an occasion to lament the star ratings on reviews, this is it. The two stars here are meant to split the difference between my entirely negative opinion of the film\u2014though the project is admittedly very well crafted\u2014and what seems to be the larger consensus.   Understand that my dislike of the film has nothing to do with its quasi-sacrilegious premise. Spoofs of the Good Book are fine by me; they just need to be funny, but Van Dormael (\u201cToto the Hero\u201d) is no Monty Python or Mel Brooks. He imagines God (played with consummate unpleasantness by Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde) as a gross guy who lives in a Brussels high-rise, where he spends most of his time at his computer devising new tortures for the human race. His son, JC, once escaped the household and was killed by the people he meant to help. Now God\u2019s only companions are JC\u2019s little sister, Ea (Pili Groyne), and their mom (Yolande Moreau), a mute presence who devotes much of her time to her collection of baseball cards.   With an altruistic bent much like her brother\u2019s, Ea sees that God\u2019s hold on humanity has much to do with people\u2019s fear of death, knowledge of which He controls. So the girl gains access to Dad\u2019s files and sends text messages to everyone on Earth telling them how much time they have left to live. While this information is generally liberating, people react differently. One young guy, told that he\u2019s got decades to go, gleefully keeps trying to commit suicide but always finds his plans improbably thwarted.   This and other gags are staged with zany acceleration and cartoonish framings of a Mack Sennett slapstick\u2014which no doubt makes them funnier for anyone inclined to laugh in the first place.   Eventually Ea discovers that she can escape her Dad\u2019s oppressive household via its washing machine, and she emerges into Brussels with a mission: find six new Apostles to bring the total to 18. That number is the same as the players on Mom\u2019s favorite baseball team. Why new Apostles are needed was never clear to me, but Ea\u2019s search for them comprises most of the film, making it very repetitive. Advertisement   Another thing left unclear is what qualifies the people Ea finds for Apostlehood. They are an odd lot. One, for example, is a guy who delights in killing people with his rifle. One day he shoots a woman who\u2019s not fazed by the bullet because she has a prosthetic arm. Amazed, the guy falls in love with her and gives up his wicked ways.   Catherine Deneuve comes into the picture due to Ea\u2019s Apostle hunt. She\u2019s a well-to-do woman in a loveless marriage. Informed of the relatively short time she has left to live, she first hires a teen male prostitute for sex, but he steals her money and bolts. She\u2019s then taken to the zoo, where she develops a crush on an enormous gorilla. Let it be said that Deneuve not only has great beauty but endless dignity; this stupid and farcical situation does nothing to degrade her.   Which can\u2019t necessarily be said for viewers of \u201cThe Brand New Testament.\u201d It's doubtless some people will find the film funny and clever. They are welcome to it."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Longshots", "Review": "If I've seen one movie about a team of underdogs, I've seen a dozen. But I hadn't seen \"The Longshots\" before. It's based on the true story of 11-year-old Jasmine Plummer, from the south Chicago suburb of Harvey, who in 2003 became the first female to play quarterback in the Pop Warner football tournament. Her story is remarkable, especially if you factor in her national wrestling title and honor student status. But the film is remarkable in other ways. It includes some of the expected elements of any film from this genre, but without the usual Hollywood supercharging. It's not all pumped up with flash and phoniness. Its stars play their characters with a quiet conviction, warm and touching. Its heroine is not the usual young girl who is required to be smarter and talk faster and correct adults in their faulty thinking. She has humility, shyness and a certain sadness. Advertisement And that is all the more impressive because Jasmine is played by Keke Palmer, who seems absolutely convincing in the role. Yet consider that this is the same actress (13 when the movie was shot) who played Queen Latifah's niece in \"Barbershop 2,\" held her own in an exchange with Cedric the Entertainer in that film, starred in many Medea projects by Tyler Perry, and was the youngest actress ever nominated for best actress by the Screen Actors Guild. That means this is real acting. Her Jasmine has not always wanted to play boys' football. In fact, she doesn't want to. But she has a good eye and a strong throwing arm, and is pushed into it by her uncle Curtis (Ice Cube), who was a star years ago on the same team. Curtis has been unemployed since the town's factory closed, has no aim in life, loves his niece, acts like a father to her because her own dad abandoned the family. He teaches her all he knows about quarterbacking, and more or less forces the coach (Matt Craven) to put her in a game. She's small but smart and quick, and soon her story is picked up by the press, and she quarterbacks the team into Pop Warner history. Some facts have been changed. Harvey becomes Minton, Ill., a town also with a sizable African-American population. Since the factory closed, Main Street has a lot of empty storefronts and there's not much civic spirit. But the team revives hope and pride. And Ice Cube and Keke Palmer create a believable uncle-niece relationship that is right down to the ground in honesty and sincerity. The team accepts her pretty quickly. They like her, she plays well, and that's that. No practical jokes or hazing, although some of the other girls in school are jealous and snippy. Some of the best things about this film are what it doesn't do. The director, Fred Durst (of the rap-rock group Limp Bizkit), and his writers Nick Santora and Doug Atchison are actually interested in these human beings, not in all the semiobligatory cliches. No team bully. No seemingly tragic injuries. Not many fans in the stands, although more trickle in when the team starts to win. A little romance between Curtis and a schoolteacher (Jill Marie Jones), but it's mostly low-key conversation. A normal role for Jasmine's mother (Tasha Smith), who runs the town diner and is not in personal crisis. The movie even lacks that old groaner, the scene where the kid spots a parent in the crowd and is suddenly inspired. And the ending will surprise you by being true to life. Advertisement The movie, in short, is absolutely sure what it wants to be, right down to the worn-out grass on the football field, so realistically photographed by Conrad W. Hall. Even the signs Jasmine's fans hold up look homemade, when a lot of teen sports movies seem to have employed sign painters. And Jasmine dresses exactly like an ordinary girl her age and doesn't seem to be auditioning for a role as an American Girl doll. The more it builds, the more it grows on you. And would you believe this? Keke Palmer was also born in Harvey."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "That Awkward Moment", "Review": "With man-child overkill at a crisis point in films and TV shows, any mainstream bro-com focusing on three attractive guys who aren't leftovers from \"The Hangover\" or second-stringers from the Apatow buffoon brigade is a relief. There might still be a place for Zach Galifianakis's unkempt insouciance, but it is nice to see that leading men who hold grown-up jobs and occasionally practice hygiene are making a comeback.  At the very least, the makers of \"That Awkward Moment\" should get credit for savvy casting, as the opening minutes of this surface-slick slice of post-college life among young male Manhattanites invitingly suggests. With Zac Efron still transitioning from his \"High School Musical\" teenybopper-dom, it was wise to match him with two talented stars on the rise, Michael B. Jordan of \"Fruitvale Station\" and Miles Teller of \"The Spectacular Now\" (of course, some of us have been on the Teller train ever since \"Rabbit Hole\" and his Willard in the \"Footloose\" remake). Advertisement With Efron as glib alpha male Jason, Jordan as straight man Mikey, and Teller as jokey sidekick Daniel, this bunch initially seems fun hang with. They do boy talk with brash aplomb, drink abundantly with no ill effects, enjoy the kind of hip-chic living quarters that they couldn't possibly afford (known as \"Friends\" syndrome) and can make a decent running gag out of how white people don't know who Morris Chestnut is. You might question Daniel's presumptuous need to hand out Viagra like breath mints to his pals as they head out on the prowl, but it does lead to one the movie's best sight gags.  But it doesn't take long\u2014somewhere between Jason pronouncing how he hates it when a casual bedroom partner suddenly asks where their relationship is going (hence, the \"moment\" of the title) and Mikey learning that his cheating wife wants a divorce\u2014before it becomes clear that this will be just another rehash of an all-too-familiar manly meme: Commitment-phobes who seek one-night stands without strings yet somehow end up getting tangled in amour.  Declaring solidarity with Mikey's sudden turn of events, the three take a vow of singlehood\u2013which shouldn't be difficult, since that is already the path they supposedly have chosen. But then Jason falls for Ellie (British up-and-comer Imogen Poots, all blue saucer eyes, funky blond hair and almost-OK American accent). Daniel suddenly decides to get serious with friend-turned-lover Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis, who proves captivating despite being stuck in one of several underwritten female roles). As for Mikey, all he foolishly wants to do is to woo his wife back.  If comedy is in the details, that is where \"That Awkward Moment\" falls short, with its plethora of plot holes and lapses in logic. Jason and Daniel are supposed to be genius book-jacket designers, but their art wouldn't be worthy of posting on a fridge alongside a kid's crayon scribbles. Meanwhile, Mikey is a doctor at a hospital, yet his schedule hardly oppressive.\u00a0Ellie invites Jason to a \"dress-up\" surprise party for her birthday, and instead of donning his good suit, he shows up in an outfit that would make an S&M devotee blush. OK, Jason was confused about what \"dress-up\" meant. But why would he wear such an embarrassing outfit anyway, knowing that Ellie's friends and family would be there? Advertisement Matters grow more problematic as Efron's storyline begins to overwhelm that of his cohorts. The more we learn about Jason, it becomes clear that he is a world-class jerk, the kind who declares, \"We are the selfish generation,\" as if that were a good thing. Is it really that romantic for him and Ellie to pose as a well-off couple interested in an expensive Gramercy Park abode and then steal the key to a private area when the real estate agent isn't looking? For a raunchy comedy, there is surprisingly little sex, much of it perfunctory. Once an untimely death occurs and Thanksgiving arrives (apparently our saddest national holiday), all seems lost, and Efron\u2014his hair pouffed perfectly, his facial scruff just so\u2014must summon whatever outward sign of gloom and suffering that he can for the camera.\u00a0And that is one awkward moment."}
{"Stars": 0.5, "Title": "Death Race", "Review": "Hitchcock said a movie should play the audience like a piano. \u201cDeath Race\u201d played me like a drum. It is an assault on all the senses, including common. Walking out, I had the impression I had just seen the video game and was still waiting for the movie. The time is the near future, not that it matters. Times are bad. Unemployment is growing. A steelworker named Jenson Aimes (Jason Statham) loses his job when the mill closes. He comes home to his loving wife and baby daughter, a masked man breaks in, the wife is killed, he is wounded, he is found guilty of his wife's murder, is sentenced to the dreaded Terminal prison. Advertisement Treasure those opening scenes of drama, however brief they may be. The movie will rarely pause again. Prisons, we learn, are now private corporations, and Terminal raises money by conducting pay-for-view Internet races. Its Death Race involves prisoners driving heavily armored cars bearing weapons such as machineguns, rocket launchers and other inconveniences. If a prisoner wins five races, he gets his freedom ... But why, oh why, must I describe the rules of a Death Race? They hardly matter, nor will I take your time to tell you why Jenson Aimes is enlisted to drive as the superstar Frankenstein, who wears a mask, so he could be anybody, which is the point. All of that is simply babble to set up the races. In a coordinated visual and sound attack, mighty cars roar around the prison grounds, through warehouses, down docks, and so on, while blasting at each other, trying to avoid booby traps and frequently exploding. Each car is assigned gimmicks like oil slicks and napalm, which can be used only once. Did I say this played like a video game? Jenson's arch-enemy is Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson), who is gay, which the plot informs us and thereafter forgets. Jenson's chief mechanic is Coach (Ian McShane), whose oily voice provides one of the film's best qualities. And the warden of the prison is Hennessey, played by Joan Allen. Yes, that ethereal beauty, that sublime actress, that limitless talent, reduced to standing in an observation post and ordering her underlings to \u201cactivate weapons.\u201d She has a line of dialogue that employs both the f-word and the s-word, and describes a possible activity that utterly baffles me. It is a threat, shall we say, that has never been uttered before and will never be uttered again. She plays her scenes with an icy venom, which I imagine she is rehearsing to use in a chat with her agent. Advertisement Exploitation-movie auteur Roger Corman is one of this film\u2019s producers, but \u201cDeath Race\u201d is not a remake of his \u201cDeath Race 2000\u201d (1975). That was a film about a cross-country race in which competitors scored points by how many people they ran over (100 points for someone in a wheelchair, 70 points for the aged, 50 points for kids and so on). Sylvester Stallone played Machine Gun Joe. David Carradine played Frankenstein, but here he only plays the voice of one of the earlier (doomed) Frankensteins. Let us conclude that \u201cDeath Race\u201d is not a brand that guarantees quality. That it will no doubt do great at the box office is yet another sign of the decline of the national fanboy mentality."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Dark Knight Rises", "Review": "\"The Dark Knight Rises\" leaves the fanciful early days of the superhero genre far behind, and moves into a doom-shrouded, apocalyptic future that seems uncomfortably close to today's headlines. As urban terrorism and class warfare envelop Gotham and its infrastructure is ripped apart, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) emerges reluctantly from years of seclusion in Wayne Manor and faces a soulless villain as powerful as he is. The film begins slowly with a murky plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax. Advertisement The result, in Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Batman trilogy, is an ambitious superhero movie with two surprises: It isn't very much fun, and it doesn't have very much Batman. I'm thinking of the over-the-top action sequences of the earlier films that had a subcurrent of humor, and the exhilarating performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker. This movie is all serious drama, with a villain named Bane whose Hannibal Lecterish face-muzzle robs him of personality. And although we see a good deal of Bruce Wayne, his alter-ego Batman makes only a few brief appearances before the all-out climax. Bane, played by Tom Hardy in a performance evoking a homicidal pro wrestler, is a mystery because it's hard to say what motivates him. He releases thousands of Gotham's criminals in a scenario resembling the storming of the Bastille. As they face off against most of the city police force in street warfare, Bane's goal seems to be the overthrow of the ruling classes. But this would prove little if his other plan (the nuclear annihilation of the city) succeeds. Bane stages two other sensational set pieces, involving destroying the Stock Exchange and blowing up a football stadium, that seemed aimed at our society's twin gods of money and pro sports. No attempt is made to account for Bane's funding and resources, and when it finally comes down to Bane and Batman going mano-a-mano during a street fight, it involves an anticlimactic fist-fight. He blows up the city's bridges and to top that lands a right hook on Batman's jaw? Bane is the least charismatic of the Batman villains, but comes close to matching Bruce Wayne and Batman in screen time. The film also supplies a heroic young cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), two potential romantic partners for Wayne, and lots of screen time for series regulars Alfred the Butler (Michael Caine, remarkably effective in several trenchant scenes), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the genius inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). One of the women is the always enigmatic Catwoman (Anne Hathaway), and the other is Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), a millionaire who may be able to rescue Wayne Enterprises after Bane's stock market mischief wipes out Wayne financially. Catwoman is a freelance burglar who's always looking out for number one, and Miranda is a do-gooder environmentalist; both are drawn irresistibly to Bruce, who is not only still a bachelor but has spent the last eight years as a hermit, walled up in Wayne Manor with the loyal Alfred. Advertisement All of these characters and their activities produce stretches in the first half of the film during which, frankly, I was not entirely sure who was doing what and with which and to whom. The movie settles in for its sensational second half, however, although not everybody will be able to precisely explain the deep stone well where Bane imprisons Bruce Wayne. The circular walls of this well represent a deadly climbing wall by which anyone can try to reach freedom, but few succeed. The actual location is in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, and we get a glimpse of some zigzagging stairs that are unforgettably shown in \"Baraka.\" Turns out Bane was held there as a child. This is a dark and heavy film; it tests the weight a superhero movie can bear. That Nolan is able to combine civil anarchy, mass destruction and a Batcycle with exercise-ball tires is remarkable. That he does it without using 3D is admirable. That much of it was shot in the 70mm IMAX format allows it to make that giant screen its own. That it concludes the trilogy is inevitable; how much deeper can Nolan dig? It lacks the near-perfection of \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), it needs more clarity and a better villain, but it's an honorable finale."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Killing Them Softly", "Review": "\"Killing Them Softly\u201d begins with a George V. Higgins novel set in Boston in 1974 and moves its story to post-Katrina New Orleans in 2008, to allow televised speeches by Barack Obama, John McCain and George W. Bush to run frequently in the background.  The facile point, I think, is that organized crime in America is troubled, just like the rest of the economy with a business slowdown and a growing recession. It\u2019s a good thing these crooks are in a lot of bars where the television sets are tuned to C-SPAN.  Advertisement The plot of \u201cKilling Them Softly\u201d centers on a deadly Catch-22. A genial guy named Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) operates high-stakes poker games for the mob. One night the game is hit by two hooded stick-up men, who make off with a big pile of mob money. This in itself is suspicious, because it looks like an inside job: What outsider, even knowing about the secret game, would be crazy enough to steal from the mob?  Talk about crazy. Some time later, Markie, feeling in a good mood, tells the players that he arranged the job himself, robbing his own game. He finds this revelation so funny that tears run down his cheeks. The job was pulled off by insignificant goombahs Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), and since the heist happens near the beginning of the film, we know instinctively that Russell and Johnny aren\u2019t going to be around at the end.  A high-level mob boss named Mickey (James Gandolfini) arrives in town, hauling his in-flight luggage through the airport like a traveling businessman. He orders the executions of Russell and Johnny by a silky hit man named Jackie (Brad Pitt), who likes to kill softly, as explained by one of the many aging classic songs on the soundtrack. These are the first two of many, many mob-on-mob killings in the film, as the syndicate administers its own version of a bailout. \u201cKilling Them Softly\u201d continues as a dismal, dreary series of cruel and painful murders, mostly by men who know one another, in a barren city where it\u2019s usually night, often rainy and is never identifiable as New Orleans \u2014 not even by the restaurants. I recall only one female character in the film, a hooker employed by Mickey, who is the only mobster not exclusively obsessed with crime, money and pecking order. As the body count grows, we meet Driver (Richard Jenkins), a gravel-voiced chief executive who appears often behind the wheel of a car parked in the wastelands beneath bridges. Here is where the Catch-22 comes in: Now that Markie has claimed credit for knocking off his own game, another one of his games is stuck up. Does it now seem inevitable that he, too, becomes a marked man? Not to me. Who with any common sense would think he was that dumb? There\u2019s some of the Higgins brand of humor in a conversation about how badly he should be beaten up. It seems as if I\u2019ve been seeing versions of this story since forever. A cast is assembled from various flavors of tough guys, they\u2019re placed in a dreary and joyless cityscape, they hold a series of fraught conversations, there is a great deal of suffering and blood, and most of them are required to die by the end. Ideally, the plot also involves romance, humor and suspense, and tense scenes involving exact timing. Not here. All \u201cKilling Them Softly\u201d takes from the limitless universe of film noir is the night and the city. Advertisement Here\u2019s a good question: How does this mob manage to support itself? \u201cKilling Them Softly\u201d contains not a single crime involving civilians. No heists, hijackings or frauds, and drug deals only among themselves. Like a captive animal struggling to free itself from a trap, they seem reduced to gnawing off their own legs.  The charisma of such actors as Gandolfini, Pitt, Liotta and Jenkins depends largely on their screen presences and our memories of them in better roles. This one, written and directed by Andrew Dominik, for example, recalls Brad Pitt\u2019s strong work in the director\u2019s earlier \u201cThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\u201d (2007).  One particular distraction is the comparison drawn between American politics and crime. Only a brief exchange between Jackie and Driver draws the parallel, and it\u2019s so labored that once is more than enough."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Skeleton Twins", "Review": "As I\u2019m writing this review of \u201cThe Skeleton Twins,\u201d I have Starship\u2019s sparkly, glossy pop tune \u201cNothing\u2019s Gonna Stop Us Now\u201d stuck in my head. It\u2019s probably stuck in yours now, too, and for that, I sincerely apologize. Originally the theme to the 1987 romantic comedy \u201cMannequin,\u201d this relentlessly optimistic No. 1 hit makes a crucial appearance in a very different way in \u201cThe Skeleton Twins.\u201d But before you cringe at the very prospect of hearing it again, just hear me out. Director and co-writer Craig Johnson uses the song so surprisingly and beautifully, you actually won\u2019t mind. Actually, you'll have an enormous smile on your face. Advertisement It\u2019s one of many examples of how Johnson and co-writer Mark Heyman take clich\u00e9d notions, upend them, breathe fresh life into them and make them feel excitingly new. That Starship song comes in the form of a spirited lip-sync between Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who co-star as estranged twins fumbling to reconnect. They also get high together\u2013a classic shorthand for breaking the ice and bonding in films\u2013and they dress up in drag for Halloween. We\u2019ve seen countless uses of these devices and too often they seem wacky, forced and flat. In \u201cThe Skeleton Twins,\u201d an off-kilter sense of humor, as well as a pervasive feeling of loneliness and regret, provides a more complex and far more human vibe. Wiig and Hader co-star as Maggie and Milo, twins who live across the country from each other and haven\u2019t spoken in a decade. She stayed in their hometown of Nyack, N.Y., got married and became a dental hygienist; he moved to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming an actor but instead works as a waiter. Their father committed suicide when they were 14. Their mother (Joanna Gleason in a brief but amusingly zany appearance) is a selfish self-help guru. But despite the time and distance that have divided them, they\u2019re still eerily in sync, and on the brink of self-destruction. The only thing that stops Maggie from swallowing a handful of pills at the film\u2019s start is the phone call from a hospital informing her that Milo has just tried to kill himself. She flies to L.A. and offers to bring him home with her, hoping that this will provide him with some stability. But obviously, she\u2019s in need of some herself. \u201cThe Skeleton Twins\u201d follows the process as Milo and Maggie learn to restore themselves by returning to each other. Again, it probably sounds very familiar\u2013like \u201cYou Can Count on Me,\u201d with an even more twisted sense of humor. But there are obstacles and twists on the road to recovery\u2013and lies, and secrets, and baggage. Maggie appears to be happily married to Lance (Luke Wilson), an overly eager and earnest nature lover who never quite gets the siblings\u2019 jokes (which makes them even funnier). Wilson finds the tricky balance of playing an ebullient and optimistic type without overplaying it, and the filmmakers were smart to portray him as an abidingly decent dude when it would have been safer to make him a joke or a jerk. Advertisement Milo, who\u2019s gay, can\u2019t help but track down the man with whom he had a scandalous affair when he was much younger (Ty Burrell in a small and slightly underdeveloped role). Hader finds his own tricky balance in playing the character in an effeminate and sarcastic way without ever going over the top into flamboyance or camp. Fundamentally, though, Wiig and Hader make this work together through their tremendous chemistry\u2013something you\u2019d expect, given that they were longtime \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d castmates and are good friends off-camera. (I half expected an episode of \"The Californians\" to break out at any moment.) But this movie asks a lot of them. It asks them to navigate territory that\u2019s both funny and dramatic, light and raw, goofy and brutally honest. And they do it spectacularly. We\u2019ve seen Wiig handle heavier material while still playing to her comic strengths in movies like \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d and she does so deftly here, as well. But Hader is just shockingly great. His performance is reminiscent of some of Robert Downey Jr.'s early work, with his ability to rattle off a wry, biting one-liner and still remain lovable, or to ooze bravado and vulnerability in a single breath. As we enter this season of big, important awards contenders that \u201cmatter,\u201d \u201cThe Skeleton Twins\u201d is a small, intimate gem that might truly matter."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Queen to Play", "Review": "I'd like to be playing a game of chess right now. I'd like to be sinking down into its cool depths and staring infinity in the face. I'd like to be competing with the player across from me in terms of implacable logic rather than motor skills and hand-eye coordination. When I play chess, I temporarily leave time. I wonder if someone who doesn't love chess as much as I do would like \"Queen to Play\" as much as I did. Such a person could enjoy the transformation of a Corsican maid into strong chess player. They might read it as a story of female empowerment, of a woman asserting herself in her marriage and in her job. That would be fair enough. Advertisement But what I enjoyed was the way the film summons up the pure obsessive passion that chess stirs in some people. I never got to be very good (although I could maybe beat you) but I spent 1965 partly sidetracked by chess. I bought books. I played through classic games. I joined a chess club. I became a fan of queenside strategies because I figured most of my opponents would know a lot more about kingside. These thoughts gave me much pleasure. Then I fell back into being what I really was, a mediocre patzer, because when you get to a certain point in chess you realize what a very long way you still have to go. \"Queen to Play\" stars Sandrine Bonnaire as Helene, a hotel maid who cycles to work through the pastoral beauty of Corsica, where Napoleon no doubt played chess many years ago. She is married to Ange (Francis Renaud), who works at a boat yard. One morning at work, she sees, through a filmy white curtain, two of the guests (Jennifer Beals and Dominic Gould) seated on the terrace and playing a game of chess that looks for all the world like foreplay. They seem so in love, they're on their honeymoon \u2014 or cheating.  Something in the scene sends an arrow through her heart. Ange is an all right guy \u2014 she thinks of him as handsome \u2014 but they no longer look at each other like that couple. For his birthday, she buys him one of those computer chess game boards that will play against you if you can't find anyone else. \"I don't play chess!\" he says in astonishment. \"Maybe you will learn,\" she says. Awake in bed, her eyes still open, she knows he never will. In the middle of the night, she takes out the game and reads the rules of chess. She finds it grand that the most powerful piece is the queen and holds it protectively.  Advertisement Her other job is cleaning for an American, a widower named Dr. Kroger (Kevin Kline). She sees a fine wooden chess set on his shelf and asks him to play. Of course he checkmates her in a few moves. But they continue to play, he teaches her fundamentals, and it turns out that she's a natural. Some people are. Not people like me. Where this all leads, I will leave for you to enjoy. The film has some sly fun with the way chess consumes Helene's mind: Even bread crumbs begin to represent chess pieces for her. The floors in hotel lobbies are often black and white squares, and the tablecloths in Italian restaurants are red and white, and so on. The most observant element of \"Queen to Play\" is the way it handles the changing relationship between Helene and Dr. Kroger (with Kline speaking in French). The story is based on the novel The Chess Player by Bertina Henrichs, and what it knows is the way the minds of two players can become engaged, not in a romantic way, but in the pure contact of their thinking. There are often no words in the mind during a chess game. Just rules of spatial relationships. It can get pretty intimate."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Paulina", "Review": "On the Internet Movie Database, the plot synopsis for Argentinian drama \"Paulina\" is appropriately\u00a0curt: \"A young woman is raped by a gang.\" This is a fitting precis since the film feels like, in many ways, a corrective to dramas that\u00a0use sexual assault as a key plot point. For example, while \"Paulina\" is not sensationalistic,\u00a0it does show an act of sexual violation. There are also clear heroes and villains in this story, and no attempt is made to completely absolve the guilty parties of their responsibility. Instead, director Santiago Mitre and co-writer Mariano Lilnas try to get us closer to understanding rather than glibly judging any of the characters involved. This is no small feat given how many times \"Paulina\" feels like a civics lesson first, and a drama second. Advertisement   Much of the film's outlook aligns with the perspective of Paulina (Dolores Fonzi), a former law student who chooses to move to teach social science in a small town. Paulina's decision to leave behind a prosperous career makes her a target for skepticism both from her conservative father Fernando (Oscar Martinez) and her sympathetic-but-disengaged boyfriend Alberto (Esteban Lamoth). These supporting characters are largely, but not exclusively defined by how much they roll their eyes at Paulina. Fernando and Albert worry, challenge, and yes, emotionally manipulate Paulina for the sake of winning her over. These are complex characters that actually talk like human beings instead of mustache-twirling accessories to a crime.   Likewise, Mitre and Lilnas take time to introduce Ciro (Cristian Salguero), the angry young student who leads a group of friends to rape Paulina. His story is, thankfully, a sub-plot that is only introduced after Paulina is attacked. Ciro's back-story also does not humanize his actions so much that he is presented as a sensitive soul worthy of canned redemption. Instead, we see him as a real person who with real problems and flaws. Ciro works at a lumber mill. He is quick to anger. He draws in his notebook. And he is sexually frustrated. I won't give too much away, but when he sees Paulina, an inner conflict comes to light. It's something that isn't easily explained away, but his actions are at least semi-contextualized.   As for Paulina: her story lives and dies based on the strength of the conversations that she has. She knows who raped her, but she doesn't know what to do about it. Paulina's story comes to a halt after she's raped since the remainder of the drama concerns her uncertainty about how to move on. She talks and is helped considerably by\u00a0women, like her aunt, and the female rape crisis counselor who provides medication without any unnecessary commentary. But she is judged as a \"victim\" by all the men she encounters, a heavy-handed verdict that male creators Mitre and Lilnas carefully try to avoid. In fact,\u00a0Mitre and Lilnas sometimes back off too much, and over-use expository dialogue\u00a0to reveal\u00a0what Paulina is thinking and feeling.\u00a0 Advertisement   But even that complaint feels minor given how refreshing it is to watch a drama that is about a difficult subject that doesn't baby viewers, nor completely devolve into hippy-dippy \"why can't we be friends\" sermonizing. Violence stings in this film, as we see when Ciro rapes Paulina, or when Ciro attacks some of his friends. These scenes do not revolve around fetishistic close-ups, which is both a commendable and a glaring omission. On the one hand: finally, an adult take on sexual violence. On the other: it feels like Mitre\u00a0committed to filming violence without having anything to say\u00a0beyond a general acknowledgment that these events occurred, and therefore cannot honestly be avoided.\u00a0   \"Paulina\" is, in that sense, worth seeing, even if its basic plot repeatedly stalls. It is a thoughtful movie, but not necessarily a fulfilling one. There's no cheap catharsis, or resolution for the viewer. There's also not a lot to emotionally engage with during multiple scenes where Paulina mulls over her options. Still, there ar some subtly moving performances, and righteously indignant speechifying. There is a lot to like about a movie where a woman gets to passionately, and eloquently explains why she is the mistress of her own destiny. I just wish that the humanism that Mitre, Lilnas, and their collaborators exhibit throughout \"Paulina\" were consistently engaging on a basic storytelling level."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Side Effects", "Review": "The music tells us what kind of movie \"Side Effects\" is going to be. It coils beneath what seems like a realistic plot and whispers that something haunted and possessed is going on. Imagine music for a sorcery-related plot and then dial it down to ominous forebodings. Without Thomas Newman's score, \"Side Effects\" would be a lesser film, even another film. We meet a young woman named Emily (Rooney Mara). Her husband, Martin (Channing Tatum), has been released after four years in prison for insider trading. Don't weep for him. At a party, he explains, \"It's the culture.\" They resume. They dine. They make eager love. Things don't go for her as smoothly as they would seem. She is referred to a psychiatrist named Banks (Jude Law). She's been under care before, with a shrink named Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta-Jones), but Banks thinks Emily may get good results from a new drug called Ablixa. Meanwhile, a drug company has paid him $50,000 to study it during the licensing period. Advertisement This Banks has issues. A Brit in Manhattan, he's divorced from a dubious woman (Vinessa Shaw). He immigrated to the United States, he explains, because in the U.K., when you enter psychiatric treatment, it's assumed you may get sicker, and over here, it's assumed you're getting well. Naturally that attitude tilts him toward pushing pills. Emily's use of Ablixa causes some alarming behavior, including a murder while in a blackout, and she's committed to a mental hospital. Banks shows few signs of empathy. Why is he a doctor in the first place? Why did his marriage fail? He meets with Victoria Siebert, and why does tension spring up between them? Banks is sitting on a lot of anger.\u00a0 There are other characters: a cop, a mother, yada yada. Always the music \u2014 never loud, always there.\u00a0Rooney Mara's performance is instrumental. In her third major role, she's on the far side of the moon from \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\" She's terrified of the world, of the doctor, of Ablixa and of herself.\u00a0Steven Soderbergh's camera often sees her from a slightly low level from her left, her hair doing the framing. Recall\u00a0Nicolas Cage\u00a0looking askance at the iguana in Herzog's \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans,\" and then dial that down to uncertainty and fear. I diagnose her with panic attacks and depression. The professionals in the film discuss real meds like Effexor, which can be effective \"over time.\" Time is what the depressed and panicked lack. Banks wants fast-acting pills. Emily dreads being diagnosed as actually nuts and being assigned to the hospital by the courts. Banks doesn't seem so concerned. Maybe another med will work. Meanwhile, we notice that he's spending an increasing amount of time with other characters, like Victoria Siebert, his ex-wife, prosecutors and colleagues. The case begins to make news and his clients fall off because they don't want a press mob seeing them going into his office. Advertisement And all this time the music. You know those scores that make you think of sad merry-go-rounds? In \"Side Effects,\" the viewer is being drawn into a vortex. Is there a level we don't suspect? Some people, ambushed by the last 10 minutes, will be thinking, \"What a load of crap.\" Soderbergh has retrofitted his film from the end backward. At the press previews, critics were not admitted unless they were there from the start. It's like an\u00a0Alfred Hitchcock\u00a0warning: \"Don't give away the beginning!\" Steven Soderbergh\u00a0has announced that, at 50, this will be his last feature film. Well, that's up to him. This one brings together threads from a lot of his work. Crime. Sex. Complicated yuppies. Smart people doing heedless things. Corruption in high places. Ablixa can even be seen as a science-fiction element. The Soderbergh film this one doesn't draw from is \"Che.\" Soderbergh came, he saw, he conquered, and now he's moving on."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Nymphomaniac: Vol. I", "Review": "The first poster released for Lars von Trier's \"Nymphomaniac\" had a Brady-Bunch structure, with images of all the main actors stacked on top of one another, each individual lost in the exact moment of sexual climax. The poster was eye-catching and funny, private and exhibitionistic at the same time. Sex may be \"natural\" and \"good\" (according to George Michael), but seeing sex onscreen (either actual or simulated) is often a game-changer. We all may do it, but how do you put it onscreen in a way that is representative of the mess/humor/actuality of it? How do you represent sex and also incorporate emotion? Human beings are often very silly about sex, especially when they get too philosophical about it. It's like getting philosophical about a sneeze. Unlike a sneeze, sex carries lifetimes of associations with it, and yet naked writhing bodies onscreen often flatten out into a general cliche representing a hazy idea of the act. The best part of Lars von Trier's fascinating, engaging and often didactic \"Nymphomaniac\" is that, despite the sometimes-grim tone and bleak color palate, it's an extremely funny film, playful, even. It's outrageous and provocative, intellectual and primal at sometimes the same time. It features of a lot of what looks like actual sex (although we are told in the end credits that the penetrative sex depicted was done by body doubles), and while it is obviously interested in sex, it is more interested in how we talk about sex, how we incorporate it into our identity (or don't). Similar to \"Melancholia,\" von Trier's masterful examination of depression, and how it feels like an outside force working on those who suffer from it, \"Nymphomaniac\" (which will be released in multiple volumes) sees sex through the eyes of a damaged woman who has made it her mission in life to remove sex from our \r\n\"love-fixated society\". She says, flatly, \"Love is blind. No, it's worse. It distorts something. It's something I never asked for.\" Advertisement Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the androgynously named Joe, who, at the opening of Volume I, is discovered lying bruised and battered in a dark alley by Seligman (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd). Seligman takes her in, tucks her in bed, and gives her tea. He is a complete stranger and he asks what happened. She warns him up front that it will not be a nice story, that she is a bad person. He assures her that nothing she tells him will shock him. He thinks she may be being too hard on herself. There's something almost unfinished about Joe, a flat affect, as she insists that her behavior has been beyond-the-pale. As the rain pours down, she \r\ntells him her story. It's a blatant theatrical device, an artificial framing, and von Trier \r\nuses it unabashedly.The film is broken up into titled-sections, each with their own narrative thru-line and tone. Occasionally, we go back to the bedroom with Seligman and Joe, when he interrupts her to ask a question about what she just said, or he interrupts to go off on his own\r\n tangent of thought. He is not freaked out by what Joe tells him. On the contrary, he is delighted by it, and seems delighted by the opportunity to talk about all of these important matters in an in-depth spit-balling kind of way. Seligman is a big fly-fisher, and much of what Joe describes, her various tactics with men, her use of different kinds of \"lures\", reminds him of his favorite hobby. Part of the delight in \"Nymphomaniac\" is its disinterest in being anything other than fully itself. That \"self\" may change on a moment-to-moment basis, which makes \"Nymphomaniac\" a dizzying experience. The film is sometimes stylized, other times totally realistic. Mathematical equations appear on the screen, counting out the sexual pumps from Joe's first lover. There are intricate diagrams of a parallel parking job, showing the swooping parabolae necessary to fit a certain car into a certain spot. A chalkboard lists questions all starting with the letter \"W\". There are long conversations about Edgar Allan Poe, Bach, and Fibonacci numbers. \"Nymphomaniac\" requires an audience to submit to these segues, to go with the flow, to hand over \r\ncontrol. Advertisement In the flashback sections of Volume I, the young Joe is played by Stacy Martin, being raised by a \"cold bitch\" of a mother, and a kindly doctor father (Christian Slater) who passes on to his daughter a love of flora and fauna. She discovers early on that when she touches herself between her legs, she gets what she calls \"the sensation\". Joe views her virginity as something that needs to be gotten rid of pronto, so she hits up a local rough-around-the-edges mechanic named Jerome (Shia LaBeouf) to do the deed; he complies with very little ceremony and no \r\npreamble. Jerome keeps entering the film, through various hard-to-believe coincidences. The mechanic somehow is transformed into a pencil-pushing office manager. When Jerome re-appears for the third time, Seligman, still listening, calls Joe on embellishing the story. This is sounding fictional now, cries Seligman. She must be making this up! Von Trier uses Brechtian distancing devices like that to comment on his own story, even as he meticulously sets up each self-contained \r\nsection. He knows we're going \"in and out\" of the action, he knows we're going to have questions and doubt her reliability as a narrator. In fact, he counts on it. Young Joe, once she lost her virginity, starts her quest to have as much sex as she possibly can. Her partner-in-crime for this is a young friend who is even more daring, and who comes up with various sexual competitions. They board a train and keep a running tally of how many conquests they can each make over the course of the night. Joe is amazed to discover how easy it is. She tells Seligman of her learning curve, the tactics and strategies she used as she worked that train. Every man is different. She is cold and calculating about it, and the scene really captures the restlessness and kamikaze bravery of young girls first trying out their sexual powers without knowing at all what they are doing. \"Nymphomaniac\" does not judge Young Joe and her friend. The only person judging Young Joe is the mature Joe, wrapped up in blankets, telling Seligman the story. Every time Seligman interrupts, Joe reminds him that his feelings about her will change once he hears the whole story. It's a hook, a tease, the film's own fly-fishing \"lure\". In one sequence, Joe relates the difficulties of juggling seven different lovers. Often the lovers meet at her door, one guy leaving as the other guy arrives. Things get messy. Joe may be able to separate sex from emotion (as a matter of fact, that is her goal), but it is not as easy for others. One guy shows up at her door, holding a couple of suits in dry-cleaning bags, announcing he has finally left his wife and is moving in. Joe is horrified, even more so when the scorned wife, known only as Mrs. H. (Uma Thurman, whose manic vicious performance is one of the film's high points and tips \"Nymphomaniac\" over into out-and-out screwball) shows up at the door with her three children. She wants the boys to see where Daddy has been spending all his time. \"Come, boys, let's go look at the whoring bed!\" \r\nexclaims Mrs. H. brightly. Advertisement The American actors use on-again off-again British accents, which adds to the blas\u00e9 humor of the thing. It's not important where these people are. It's not even important who they are. It's important what they do, and it's important how they think about what they do. \"Nymphomaniac\" does not make the mistake of suggesting that Joe's behavior is connected to a bad experience in her childhood. This is not a redemption narrative or a trauma narrative, at least not yet. Sex feels good all on its own; sex is its own reward. Seligman sometimes misses the point of Joe's narrative, musing about how addiction can dull a person's moral apparatus. Joe wants to make sure she is perfectly clear with him: She embraced sex because of the \r\n\"sensation\" it provided her. The power she had over men was secondary. She loves lust, and her lust makes her heartless. Well, it's a heartless world. Joe sees herself as an outlaw, taking charge of her own hunger, and as a young woman she and her group of \r\nfellow outlaw friends create a club which has an Erica Jong-like mission statement: \"We have the right be horny.\" The fact that the club shuns members who sleep with the same guy twice is an explicit acknowledgement of the bonding emotional power of sex, something the girls all want to \r\navoid. Volume I ends on a wrenching note, with Joe at a painful crossroads in her own sexual philosophy, and scenes from Volume II unfurl alongside the roll of credits. All of the talk in Volume I about lust and sensation and \"cocks\" (we get a gallery of different penises flashing \r\nacross the screen) translates into some extremely dreary sex in \"Nymphomaniac\", boring, bored, silly, embarrassing. You look at some of it and think, \"What on earth is the point?\" None of it is erotic. All that pounding and thrusting and grinding adds up to a keening unspoken awareness of the emptiness at the center of humanity, the looming presence of death, the doomed possibilities of not only connection, but feeling itself. Advertisement Sex can be many things, it can express love, hate, power, revenge. It can relieve boredom. It can be overlaid with intellectual considerations, or concerned with concepts such as consent, objectification, misogyny, the entire history of cultural baggage people bring into bed with them. \"Nymphomaniac: Vol. I\" addresses these heavy\r\n topics, but in a way that doesn't feel heavy at all. The film is an intellectual high-wire act, death-defying, dangerous, entertaining, and delighting in its own inventiveness and daring."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Mr. Holmes", "Review": "Prof. Moriarty is renowned as Sherlock Holmes\u2019 most notorious archenemy. But the world\u2019s greatest detective grapples with an even more relentless foe in \u201cMr. Holmes,\u201d the latest big-screen incarnation of Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s literary creation.\u00a0His name? Mortality. His game? Inevitability. And the game is definitely afoot in 1947, as the elderly super sleuth attempts to crack some of the mysteries that continue to haunt him at this late stage of his life. There are more than a few clues as to why director Bill Condon would like to erase the bad taste left by 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Fifth Estate,\u201d his botched attempt to capture the enigma that is WikiLeaks creator Julian Assange (as played by another Mr. Holmes, Benedict Cumberbatch), with this intriguing if only semi-satisfying Sherlockian enterprise. Advertisement For one, \u201cMr. Holmes\u2019 provides a perfect chance for a reunion with\u00a0Ian McKellen, who was Oscar-nominated for his wily and witty work as the original \u201cFrankenstein\u201d director\u00a0James Whale\u00a0in 1998\u2019s \u201cGods and Monsters,\u201d which won the filmmaker an Academy Award for his adapted screenplay.\u00a0\u201cMr. Holmes\u2019 also features one of his stars from 2004\u2019s \u201cKinsey,\u201d Laura Linney, who earned an Oscar nod as the noted sex researcher\u2019s wife. Here, she dowdies herself down nicely as Holmes\u2019 often-disapproving housekeeper.\u00a0 Condon does right by both actors again, although the film is at its best as a showcase for the splendid and spell-binding Sir Ian, who has taken on two other pop-cultural icons, Gandalf the wizard and X-Men nemesis Magneto, since they last collaborated. Much like \u201cWoman in Gold,\u201d where the glowing presence of Helen Mirren was compensation enough to sit through a rather spotty enterprise, the 76-year-old actor\u2014donning rivulets of extra wrinkles and a padded aquiline nose\u2014overcomes a script with an excess of flashbacks to convince us that we are truly witnessing the one and only Sherlock in his dotage.\u00a0 Not that Holmes, first seen as a 93-year-old retiree spending his waning twilight years at a picturesque cottage by the sea in the southern part of post-World War II England, isn\u2019t attempting to fight back against the infirmities of old age. He has taken up beekeeping as an avocation, partly to gather royal jelly that supposedly wards off forgetfulness. When we first see him, the former private eye is freshly back from a Japan that is still reeling from the effects of the atom bomb after securing a batch of a mysterious restorative herb known as prickly ash. Or, as his disbelieving physician calls it, \u201cashly prick\u201d\u2014which is as close to bawdy as \u201cMr. Holmes\u201d ever gets.\u00a0 Advertisement There is a fount of welcome youth to be found on the premises to fill in for the late Dr. Watson, Sherlock\u2019s faithful sidekick, in the form of the widowed housekeeper\u2019s young son. The collusion between a crusty yet still-ticking Sherlock and Roger (a tiptop Milo Parker, whose boyish resilience and innate curiosity is reminiscent of onetime Disney child star Bobby Driscoll) as he teaches the lad about both bee farming and the art of detecting is the heart and most compelling part of \u201cMr. Holmes.\u201d There is something sadly discomforting in witnessing this genius in decline, his blue eyes going opaque to indicate senior moments and his fading voice expressing deep regret over the past, especially his valuing of logic over emotion. In order to pay Roger back for his services and also prod his own memory, he devotes himself to recalling details of his final and least successful case in story form, which the boy eagerly reads as each page is done. As Holmes scribbles what happened on parchment, we are taken back to 1917, when the husband of a woman named Ann Kelmot (Hattie Morahan) hired Holmes to check up on his wife\u2019s strange behavior following two miscarriages. The case itself ultimately proves less an involving puzzle for the audience than a lesson for Holmes in humility\u2014a state that he has rarely if ever exhibited in his many incarnations, whether in the original tales, Basil Rathbone\u2019s cinematic version from the \u201830s and \u201840s or Jeremy Brett\u2019s TV portrayal in the \u201880s and \u201890s. In fact, Condon has some fun with having the elder Holmes head to the theater to check out one of the overwrought B-movies based on Dr. Watson\u2019s much-embellished written renderings of his friend\u2019s exploits. That it is Nicholas Rowe, who played the title character in 1985\u2019s \u201cYoung Sherlock Holmes,\u201d appearing in the black-and-white picture is a neat trick, indeed. Advertisement But then we also must deal with less-interesting flashbacks to Holmes\u2019 recent foray to Japan, where a local guide (Hiroyuki Sanada) helps him find the supposedly rejuvenating plant. This plot strand eventually sets up the film\u2019s redemptive conclusion but falls somewhat flat. Actually, a certain placidity seeps into too much of the film, even if McKellen is consistently enjoyable and gets a chance to share a nice moment of interplay when a still-dapper Holmes and Kelmot eventually meet on a park bench. But whatever tension exists onscreen primarily is in Sherlock\u2019s mind. And, in this movie at least, it is like watching a door oh so slowly being shut."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Salt of Life", "Review": "The three happiest men in Gianni's world in \"The Salt of Life,\" are no doubt the three old timers who sit all day every day on plastic chairs lined up in front of a cafe in Rome and chat endlessly. There's also the old dude who walks his toy poodle, \"a beautiful dog.\" Certainly Gianni's best friend Alfonso is unhappy, despite his tireless quest for women a third his age. Least happy of all is Gianni, who lacks the will to stop looking, and the nerve to begin.  Gianni (Gianni Di Gregorio, the film's director) is 60. The most notable features on his careworn face are the bags under his eyes. He lives in a spacious apartment with his wife, daughter and his daughter's boyfriend, Michelangelo, who talks with him more than the other two combined. On the ground floor of his building lives the cheerful Aylin (Aylin Prandi), who pretends to be madly in love with him. He walks her St. Bernard and his own inconspicuous family dog, whose breed he doesn't even know or care about. Advertisement The bane of his existence is his 90-ish mother (Valeria De Franciscis), deeply tanned no doubt from the many poker games she plays with her peers in the garden of her luxurious house. She has all the money. Gianni lives on a pension and his wife's income, and grits his teeth as his mother serves champagne to her poker buddies and buys designer gowns for her caregiver. His marriage is peaceful and his wife affectionate but seems focused elsewhere. It is probably an omen for the daughter's boyfriend that he spends so much time with his future father-in-law commiserating about the women in the family. One look at Gianni's mother's caregiver, and Alfonso can't believe Gianni isn't carrying on with her. Gianni's only response is the body language for \"meh.\" His carrying-on days are over. But he begins to be persuaded by Alfonso that 60 is too young to retire completely from the chase. \"The Salt of Life\" tells his story in an affectionate, low-key way, not as a smutty sex com but as a gentle look at a harmless man who realizes he has become invisible, except to people who need something from him. His mother, for example, needs him to come over twice in the same day to adjust the TV set. The movie is alert to his wounds. He thanks a bartender for his drink. Is ignored. Thanks her again. And again. \"She can't hear me,\" he tells Alfonso. He passes a group of young women on the street. They can't see him. The busty middle-aged daughter of his mother's friend invites him to her house on Sunday afternoon. He buys a summer suit for himself and a bouquet for her. When he arrives, she is taking a music lesson, and he realizes she set up the visit to make her teacher feel possessive.  I know women are mistreated by men in countless ways every day. Men sometimes get their turn. In this movie, only two women are actually cruel to Gianni (the music student, and his mother, who is polishing off 90 years of emasculation). At least they have uses for him. This is a movie about a man who is past his shelf life. Sooner or later, he'll end up sitting in front of that cafe with the other guys. He knows it. He even tries it one day. The sexy Aylin comes past, throws her arms around his neck and whispers, \"What are you doing sitting here?\" I can think of so many answers, none of which would much cheer him. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Faster", "Review": "\"Faster\" is a pure thriller, all blood, no frills, in which a lot of people get shot, mostly in the head. Rotate the plot, change the period, spruce up the dialogue, and this could have been a hard-boiled 1940s noir. But it doesn't pause for fine touches and efficiently delivers action for an audience that likes one-course meals. Dwayne Johnson stars in the kind of role he's possibly been avoiding up until now. Once known as The Rock, he has developed a kinder, gentler screen persona that more closely fits him in real life. It's a melancholy fact of Hollywood today that \u201cFaster\u201d could be a good career move, sending him on the trail blazed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. Johnson has very broad shoulders and wicked tattoos, and a gun seems to grow from his hand. Advertisement As the film opens, he's being released from prison after a 10-year term. He walks out the gate into a desert wilderness and begins to run \u2014 run \u2014 to a nearby city, where a circa 1970 Chevelle is waiting for him in a junkyard. This is because modern cars all look boring, and most action heroes drive classics. He whips off the tarp and peels outta there. A private eye gives him a list of names, and he sets out to murder everyone on the list. His character is named Driver. A clue to this, and the title, is that he invariably drives at the top possible speed, and obviously never took driver's ed in high school, because he doesn't know how to turn around and drive in the other direction except by slamming on the brakes, twisting the wheel and whipping through 180 degrees. Driver is soon wanted for one, then two, then three murders. The cops know who he is. His photo is on the TV news. This all takes place in Bakersfield, Calif. What are the odds a tattooed killer with a shaved head could elude the Bakersfield police for long while piloting a classic Chevelle at 80 mph and laying rubber all over town? In \u201cFaster,\u201d excellent. The cop on the case is Cicero (Carla Gugino). She finds herself saddled with a partner known as Cop (Billy Bob Thornton). He's two weeks from retirement. As we all know, anyone two weeks from retirement, be he cop, fireman, stunt man, prison guard or kindly old dad, will never make it. Cop is also mainlining heroin, for no better reason than to show him doing it. One fix lasts him for the rest of the film. Cicero and Cop try to track down Driver, who seeks vengeance on those who squealed about a bank heist and killed his brother. These people have moved into other lines of work, most notably, Preacher (Buzz Belmondo), who runs revival tent meetings. We find out more about them. And we meet the fatuous Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a British addict of extreme sports, who is a professional hit man for fun. This is some guy. He informs his girlfriend Lily (Maggie Grace) that he has \u201cbeaten\u201d yoga, having mastered the most difficult three positions, and is ready to move on. Advertisement As Driver tracks his victims, Killer tracks Driver and Cop and Cicero tracks them all, director George Tillman Jr. does a lean, efficient job of creating stark action scenes. Driver shows vestiges of a personality, reluctantly. Billy Bob creates a Cop who looks like it's been all downhill for him since \u201cBad Santa.\u201d Gugino, a good actress, gamely pretends to be in a more nuanced movie. And the hits keep coming. Note: Doubtless there is a photo of Dwayne Johnson with this review. Study it, and then ponder this listing in the end credits: Dwayne Johnson's hair stylist: Rachel Soloq."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "I Declare War", "Review": "In \"I Declare War,\" 13-year-olds engage in a daily game of Capture the Flag. With sticks, logs, fake guns, and balloons filled with red paint, each team strategizes and hunts down their enemies. Their playground is a seemingly endless stretch of woods, and PK (Gage Munroe), the leader of one team, has never lost a game. PK's current opponent, Quinn (Aidan Gouveia) appears to be his most formidable foe, which worries PK to no end. Quinn's team includes the only female player, Jess (Mackenzie Munro), and Skinner (Michael Friend), the biggest player. The game takes up the entire running time, filling it with double crosses, heroic saves and feats of strategy more suited to 30-year-olds than teenagers. Advertisement My plot synopsis makes \"I Declare War\" sound like a young adult movie where, for a change, the characters are playing wargames outside rather than on the Xbox. This could have made for a diverting feature, especially with the strategic aspects of Capture the Flag. Unfortunately, filmmakers Jason Lapeyre and Robert Wilson wish to impress far more meaning onto the teenagers' games. \"I Declare War\" plays like a C-student's final exam essay on \"Lord of the Flies.\" Any interest in the game is overridden by the massive amounts of allegory lifted straight from Golding's novel. As a scenario, unsupervised teenagers running around in the woods syncs up with \"Lord of the Flies,\" especially when their numbers include the weak, the strong, the empathetic and the sadistic.  In place of Golding's murderous sadism is a device so absurdly misused it destroyed all suspension of disbelief. Every so often, the characters' fake artillery becomes \"real.\" The paint-filled balloons, which signify immediate \"death\" if a player gets splattered with them, turn into actual grenades. The obviously fake guns the kids fire at one another become actual weapons with muzzle flashes and gunshots on the soundtrack. Logs become bazookas and Jess turns into Katniss from \"The Hunger Games,\" wielding a crossbow and shooting an arrow into a kid who makes other kids' heads explode telepathically, like that tire in \"Rubber.\" I am well aware that these transformations are taking place in the minds of the players, and are not meant to be real events. The bullets never make bloody wounds, even at close range. Fantasy or not, the film is still showing kids under fire and, in the current climate of school shootings, gang initiations and teen suicides, this strikes me as kind of sick. I'd be less bothered if this had a point instead of feeling like a cynical ploy to get paying customers: A glock in a kid's hand is worth at least a few butts in theater seats. Tossing children into war-like scenarios with machine guns and explosions plays like a cross between \"Platoon\" and that Alan Parker kiddie gangster musical from 1976\u2014it's Oliver Stone's \"Bugsy Malone\"! Except Oliver wouldn't have the Stones to take this scenario to a dark place that justifies its visuals. Advertisement When \"I Declare War\" does try for some darkness, these elements only muddy the waters of tone. Skinner is clearly a sadist who, after \"murdering\" Quinn in a coup, takes over Quinn's team. Quinn is \"dispatched\" because, after capturing PK's best friend and teammate, Kwan (Siam Yu), Quinn wants to follow the rules and \"kill\" Kwan. Skinner wants to take Kwan prisoner to flush PK out. After Quinn's \"demise,\" Skinner sends his other teammates on missions. He then ties Kwan up and tortures him. Notice there are no quotation marks around the word torture, because it really looks like Skinner is torturing this kid. Are those heavy rocks crushing Kwan imaginary? Is his bloodied wrist, cut with the ropes, imaginary too? How am I to interpret the part where this huge Caucasian actor bares down on a much smaller Asian kid, calling him a \"ch\u2014k\" multiple times? What do the filmmakers wish to impart with these scenes?  When \"I Declare War\" ended with a character willing to mutilate his own teammate (but only a minor flesh wound, mind you), I asked myself what the point of all this was. Is this film supposed to be a Vietnam allegory? A dissertation on how childishly absurd war can be? Was it a Golding-like treatise on the Evil that Men Do as played out by teenage boys? And what the hell was the deal with the exotic-looking kid who kept showing up with the husky? He becomes something of a hero but has like one line of dialogue in the entire movie!  It doesn't matter. Everybody survives and goes home, which is the ultimate cop-out for a movie this rife with \"fake\" violent imagery. \"I Declare War\" is like high school English class, rife with confusing symbolism and full of sound and fury that ultimately signifies nothing."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Pixels", "Review": "The\r\ncentral premise behind the new Adam Sandler comedy \"Pixels\" is so\r\nundeniably promising on its most basic level that as I walked into the\r\nscreening, I felt a genuine anticipation that I cannot easily recall ever feeling in\r\nconjunction with one of his films, at least of those cranked out by his Happy\r\nMadison production company. Unfortunately, a good premise can only take a film so far if it\r\nhas been accompanied by abysmal execution.\r\nOh, \"Pixels\"\u00a0does have a couple of laughs scattered here and there, and the film as a\r\nwhole is certainly better than such recent Sandler disasters as \"That's My\r\nBoy,\" \"Blended\" and the truly inexplicable \"The\r\nCobbler,\" but when one considers how good this material might have been if\r\nplaced in the right hands, to see it squandered this way makes it almost more\r\npainful to view than the typical Sandler stinker. Advertisement The conceit\r\nhere is that back in 1982, NASA launched into orbit a capsule that contained\r\nnumerous examples of our then-contemporary popular culture as a way of reaching\r\nout to possible alien life forms that might be curious to know about that thing\r\nthat we on Earth called \"The Pirate Movie,\" including a cassette\r\nchronicling a video game championship featuring young arcade masters showing\r\ntheir skills at the top games of the era. Unfortunately, a hostile alien force\r\nintercepts the tape, determines its contents to be an act of war, and begins\r\nsending down large and malevolent versions of the characters from those games\r\nto attack Earth as a response to the alleged challenge with the fate of the\r\nplanet hanging in the balance. The spaceships from \"Galaga\" rain\r\npixilated horror in Peru, a \"Centipede\" games breaks out over\r\nLondon's Hyde Park and the grid-like layout of New York City sets the scene for\r\nwhat proves to be the world's largest Pac-Man game.  Drastic\r\ntimes call for drastic measures and so the President (Kevin James) hits upon the idea of bringing in old school gamers to advise on\r\nhow to stop the invading forces. Luckily, his childhood best friend, Sam\r\nBrenner (Sandler), was a young gaming prodigy back in the day until his life\r\nwas ruined after losing that aforementioned championship when he placed second\r\nat Donkey Kong. He is joined by Ludlow (Josh Gad), another participant in that\r\ncompetition who has become a paranoid conspiracy buff (he is convinced JFK\r\nfired first, chuckle chuckle) with an unhealthy obsession towards Lady Lisa,\r\nthe scantily-clad heroine of \"Dojo Girl.\" (This game does not\r\nactually exist but as those scoring at home will quickly discover,\r\nverisimilitude is not exactly the film's strong point) Overblown egomaniac\r\nEddie \"The Fireblaster\" Plant (Peter Dinklage)\u2014who beat Sam at that\r\nfateful Donkey Kong game\u2014signs on as well but carries a shocking secret that\r\ncould lead to the destruction of the world. Finally, in a small concession that\r\nwomen also play games as well, the guys are joined by Lt. Col. Violet van\r\nPatten (Michelle Monaghan), a brilliant specialist who creates the weird\r\nweaponry to be used against the invaders. (Of course, she is just a girl in a\r\nmovie aimed at adolescent boys so her signature moves include zapping a Smurf\r\nand downing Chardonnay while sobbing about her romantic troubles at length to\r\nthe guy who has arrived to install her flat-screen TV.) Like I\r\nsaid, the premise of \"Pixels\" (which was inspired by a 2010 short) is sound, and in a\r\nperfect world, it could have been the hi-tech hybrid of \"The Last\r\nStarfighter\" and \"Ghostbusters\" that it clearly wants to be.\r\nIndeed, there are moments when the sight of giant-sized arcade icons wreaking\r\nhavoc do have a certain grandeur to them, even if their overexposure in the\r\ncoming attractions previews has inevitably reduced much of their immediate\r\nimpact. Alas, while the technologies used to bring these characters from their\r\n8-bit origins to the CGI world are as state-of-the-art as can be, the\r\nscreenplay is closer to \"Oregon Trail\" by comparison. Instead of\r\ntaking the time to really hash out the concept,\r\nco-writers and frequent Sandler collaborators Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling have essentially shunted it to the side in\r\norder to make room for the usual nonsense: people acting like idiots for no\r\napparent reason, an attitude towards women that should appeal to those\r\nGamergate oafs, cameo appearances from Sandler's buddies and the usual bits of\r\ngross-out humor. (You'll believe a Q*Bert can whiz!) Advertisement Although\r\nI can't help but wonder what someone like Joe Dante, an excellent filmmaker\r\nwith a genuine interest in the perils and pleasures of American popular\r\nculture, might have done with this concept, Chris Columbus, the guy behind\r\n\"Home Alone,\" \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and the first two\r\n\"Harry Potter\" joints, does what he can with the material, but while\r\nsome of the big special effects set-pieces are nicely put together, he seems as\r\nbored directing all the stuff in between as viewers will be watching it. On the\r\nother side of the camera, Sandler and James simply bounce from scene to scene\r\ndelivering their shopworn material with such little effort that they somehow\r\nseem less substantial than the pixelated creatures they are battling, Monaghan\r\nis thoroughly wasted in a role that doesn't even begin to hint at the talents\r\nthat she has displayed in the past in such things as the little-seen drama\r\n\"Trucker\" and the first season of \"True Detective,\" and Josh\r\nGad continues his campaign to become the single most obnoxious performer to\r\ngrace movie screens in our time. On the other hand, Peter Dinklage does wind up\r\nscoring the lion's share of the laughs here with a swaggeringly silly turn that\r\nhas clearly been inspired by Billy Mitchell, the obnoxious real-life gaming\r\nchampion who was the subject of the documentary \"The King of Kong.\" Viewers of a certain age may look\r\nat \"Pixels\" with a degree of nostalgia, although it stands to reason that if you are\r\nold enough to feel nostalgic about playing \"Donkey Kong\" in the\r\narcade, you are probably too old for an Adam Sandler film. However, when you consider\r\nhow good it could have been and should have been, it has to go down as one of\r\nthe season's bigger disappointments in the way that it quickly gives up the\r\nghost(s). On the bright side, Hollywood is remaking films so quickly these days\r\nthat it is only a matter of time before they get to doing this one again."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Pirates of Somalia", "Review": "This movie\u2019s title is more than a little cheeky when you consider that the lead character, a young Canadian wannabe journalist who hits on the idea that he can really make a name for himself by courting danger on the other side of the world, barely makes it on board a boat in the picture\u2019s nearly two-hour running time. More accurate would be \u201cThe Bro Who Wanted to Get in with the Pirates of Somalia.\u201d Based on a book by Jay Bahadur, the movie opens in the Great White North. Jay (Evan Peters, coming off like a much less wholesome version of Patrick Fugit in \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d) nurses his journo dreams in the basement of his parents\u2019 home (he\u2019s got a poster of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d on a plywood wall down there), while his younger brother steals his Red Bull and his bro buddies taunt him as they embark on a trip to a local bar called Parrots. After a snow-shoveling mishap, he finds himself in a doctor\u2019s waiting room and learns the crusty old guy in the chair across from him is Canadian journalism legend Seymour Tobin. Tobin is played by Al Pacino in what amounts to a slightly extended cameo; Pacino handles the role in the mode he used when he interrogated Hank Azaria in \u201cHeat.\u201d You keep expecting him to say things like \u201cI\u2019ve got a GREAT LEDE!\u201d But the script, by director Bryan Buckley, never accommodates him in this respect. Instead, he offers pearls such as \u201cYou read too much. F**k more girls instead.\u201d After looking at Bahadur\u2019s writing, he offers, \u201cYou\u2019re not the second coming of Hunter S. Thompson.\u201d Advertisement There\u2019s an interesting subtext in this movie. Despite its ostensible mission to shed some life on Somali culture and the precarious situation of its democracy, the movie is really all about a white guy trying to earn cultural currency in an era when what he represents is on an ever-more hurried wane. Late in the movie, when Jay is introduced to Somalia\u2019s president, that man jokes \u201cYou are the next Bob Woodward?\u201d and Jay replies that he always identified more with Carl Bernstein. Jay\u2019s aspirations constantly take him into the past, a past that really IS dead, and getting more dead. The cool journalistic customer chronicling the end of colonialism has less and less place in a world that\u2019s ever more post colonial. There is no hope for a journalistic groundbreaker of the present or future: it is only the recent past that contains viable models. This is part of the movie\u2019s problem. Aside from it being another how-I-made-out-in-an-\u201cexotic\u201d-locale narrative. The film means for us to delight in Jay\u2019s flouting of conventions. When the little boy who\u2019s befriended him spots the attractive wife of a local kingpin from out of Jay\u2019s window, Jay exclaims, \u201cYou\u2019re a good wingman, Assad,\u201d and we are meant to be charmed. The movie does contain some good acting work, mostly from the actors portraying Somali characters; Barkhad Abdi is engaging as Abdi, who guides Jay after he first touches down and advises him to not take up CBS News\u2019 offer of $1,000.00 to anyone who can get hostage footage from a Somali ship. Speaking of which, in one of the movie\u2019s most ill-advised bravura touches, the \u201cpiracy\u201d stuff is mostly confined to scenes in which Jay and whoever he\u2019s trying to inveigle for information get high on shared khat (a flowering plant native to Africa that causes a speedy euphoria). So they\u2019ll be chewing on khat and talking, and boom, Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s \u201cHypnotize\u201d comes on the soundtrack and high-seas attacks are portrayed in neon-bright animation. Because they\u2019re stoned, you see. Like so much else in this movie, it\u2019s not as cute as it thinks it is."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "(Untitled)", "Review": "\"(Untitled)\" picks a fight with its very title, which summarizes the f-you attitude of its hero, a composer of music that sounds like something you'd hear going on in the alley late at night. One of his compositions consists of a chain dropped into a can, a pennywhistle, loudly ripping paper, a bucket being kicked, the screams of a vocalist and squawks on a clarinet. He plays the piano with his elbows. Under the circumstances, it seems ungracious for him to complain about an audience member's cell phone. Advertisement This musician is named Adrian Jacobs (Adam Goldberg), a bearded thirtysomething who seems to have chugged a pint of bile. A good audience for him might consist of two dozen people; some walk out and the rest stare incredulously at the stage. One day his brother Josh (Eion Bailey) brings a date to his concert. This is Madeleine Gray (Marley Shelton), who runs a very, very avant-garde art gallery in Soho. Adrian asks he if can borrow her dress. It's made of shiny black plastic, it squeaks when she walks, and he thinks he can use the sound in his music. \"(Untitled)\" is a comedy worthy of the best Woody Allen, and Adrian is not unlike Woody's persona: a sincere, intense, insecure nebbish, hopeless with women, aiming for greatness. He plays classical piano brilliantly, and with contempt. If his \"serious\" work appeals to very few people, that's too many for him. Josh, however, is raking in the dough with his canvases, which are snatched up in volume for the lobbies of hotels. The movie plunges fearlessly but not brainlessly into the world of art so cutting edge it has run out of edges. Remember Damien Hirst, the British artist who inspired a firestorm when he won the Turner Prize for such works as a shark preserved in formaldehyde? One of Madeleine's clients is Ray Barko (Vinnie Jones), whose art consists of a dead cat splayed on a wall, a goose apparently buried in a wall up to its wings, and a montage for a monkey and vacuum cleaner. A rich client (Zak Orth) eats up this stuff. Lots of people do. I don't know if they enjoy it as much as I love my Edward Lear watercolors. Maybe they love it more.  Madeleine hires Adrian and his musicians to perform at her gallery, as \"conceptual art.\" Well, I once attended a poetry reading featuring a revolving fan. Madeleine goes nuts for Adrian, and he finds her hard to resist because everything she wears makes noise. She seems to conceal a sound-effects artist in her knickers. Adrian tunes in; the soundtrack subtly enhances what he hears. They grow chummy. He attends Madeleine's opening for an artist named Monroe, played by an actor named Ptolemy Slocum, whose own name is a work of art. Meanwhile, Josh's insipid work (pastels of vague shapes adorned by small circles) supports the gallery, but Madeleine keeps them in the back room. He \"doesn't need\" a gallery opening, she explains. She hates them, is what it is. Advertisement It's easy to take cheap shots at conceptual art. \"(Untitled)\" doesn't do that. It takes expensive shots. Adrian's music has been created for the film by the respected composer David Lang, and Ray Barko's grotesque animals were created by Los Angeles artist Kyle Ng. The thing is, their deliberately (I think) absurd work resembles the real thing, when lesser movies would just ask the art department to drum up something. Barko's \"work,\" given the right setting, would sell. That gives the film plausibility. Jonathan Parker, who directed and co-wrote with Catherine di Napoli (they collaborated on \"Bartleby\"), also respects these artists -- in a sense. Adrian can manifestly play the piano in a traditional way, so his music is a choice, not a necessity. Ray Barko has so many problems that his art may be a valid expression of his misery. Doubt remains about Monroe (played by Ptolemy Slocum, you will recall), whose pieces include a label reading Untitled White Wall, which is displayed on a white wall. Not any old white wall, you understand. It has to be the right white wall. I wonder if he'd need to tear up part of your house for its proper installation. This is a good film, a smart film. It knows a lot about art and wears its knowledge lightly, dealing with its subject in a way even a student at the Art Institute might not find condescending. As so often happens, casting decisions help enormously in its success. As Madeleine, Marley Shelton is like a lot of bright, formidable young women, ambitious, idealistic, bored by most of the men she meets. Vinnie Jones plays Barko as a reunion of pugnacious British eccentrics. Do not overlook the fetching Lucy Punch, as a member of Adrian's band known only as \"The Clarinet.\" Shelton has the confidence and presence of a born comedienne, and as for Adam Goldberg, he plays the role without shred of humor, which is exactly right.  Meanwhile, I have put out a Google alert to see if New York gossips identify the original(s) for the rich collector. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "The Twilight Saga: New Moon", "Review": "The characters in this movie should be arrested for loitering with intent to moan. Never have teenagers been in greater need of a jump-start. Granted some of them are more than 100 years old, but still: their charisma is by Madame Tussaud. \t\"The Twilight Saga: New Moon\" takes the tepid achievement of \"Twilight\" (2008), guts it, and leaves it for undead. You know you're in trouble with a sequel when the word of mouth advises you to see the first movie twice instead. Obviously the characters all have. Long opening stretches of this film make utterly no sense unless you walk in knowing the first film, and hopefully both Stephanie Meyer novels, by heart. Edward and Bella spend murky moments glowering at each other and thinking, So, here we are again. Advertisement \tBella (Kristen Stewart) is still living at home with her divorced dad (Billy Burke), a cop whose disciplinary policy involves declaring her grounded for the rest of her life and then disappearing so she can jump from cliffs, haunt menacing forests, and fly to Italy so the movie can evoke the sad final death scene from--why, hold on, it's Romeo and Juliet! The very play Edward was reciting narcissistically and contemptuously in an opening scene. \tYes, Edward (Robert Pattinson) is back in school, repeating the 12th grade for the 84th time. Bella sees him in the school parking lot, walking toward her in slow-motion, wearing one of those Edwardian Beatles jackets with a velvet collar, pregnant with his beauty. How white his skin, how red his lips. The decay of middle age may transform him into the Joker. \tEdward and the other members of the Cullen vampire clan stand around a lot with glowering skulks. Long pauses interrupt longer ones. Listen up, lads! You may be immortal, but we've got a train to catch. \tEdward leaves, because Bella was not meant to be with him. Although he's a vegetarian vampire, when she gets a paper cut at her birthday party one of his pals leaps on her like a shark on a tuna fish. \tIn his absence she's befriended by Jake (Taylor Lautner), that nice American Indian boy. \"You've gotten all buff!\" she tells him. Yeah, real buff, and soon he's never wearing a shirt and standing outside in the winter rain as if he were--why, nothing more than a wild animal. They don't need coats like ours, remember, because God gave them theirs. \tThose not among that five percent of the movie's target audience that doesn't already know this will (spoiler) be surprised that Jake is a werewolf.  Bella: So\u2026you're a werewolf?\r\tJake: Last time I checked.\r\tBella: \"Can't you find a way to...just stop?\r\tJake (patiently): \"It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.\" \tJake is influenced, or controlled, or something, by Sam, another member of the tribe. He's like the alpha wolf. Sam and his three friends are mostly seen in long shot, shirtless in the rain, hanging around the edges of the clearing as if hoping to dash in and pick off some fresh meat. Advertisement \tBella writes long letters to her absent vampire friend Alice (Ashley Greene), in which she does nothing to explain why she is helplessly attracted to these sinister, humorless and vain men. It can't be the sex. As I've already explained in my review of the first film, The Twilight Saga is an extended metaphor for teen chastity, in which the punishment for being deflowered I will leave to your imagination. \tThe movie includes beauteous fields filled with potted flowers apparently buried hours before by the grounds crew, and nobody not clued in on the plot. Since they know it all and we know all, sitting through this experience is like driving a tractor in low gear though a sullen sea of Brylcreem."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Armstrong Lie", "Review": "There are two general narratives about Lance Armstrong, and in his new documentary, \"The Armstrong Lie,\" Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney tackles them both, to varying degrees of success. The first is the fall from grace of an all-American hero following his unprecedented seven-straight-wins at the Tour de France between 1999 and 2005 as well as his unexpected comeback in 2009. The second is, arguably, more interesting, and it's the fact that practically every single professional cyclist was doping like a clubber at a rave. To paraphrase Deep Throat in \"All the President's Men,\" everyone was involved. Advertisement Of course, this does not detract from the sheer mendacity, belligerence, and simple unpleasantness of Lance Armstrong, who comes across as the sort of guy you definitely would not want to sit down and have a beer with. Gibney originally intended his film to cover Armstrong's comeback (he'd actually completed the documentary, but hadn't screened it), but then the doping scandal hit the news. After some time had passed, Gibney changed his focus and revisited the footage. Gibney's film paints a picture of an overly ambitious man whose supreme, almost clinical, self-confidence severed his connection to reality and truth.  Alex Gibney's previous films, such as \"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room\" and \"Taxi to the Dark Side,\" tend to have a much more deliberate and assured structure, which this film lacks. Of course, given the complexity of the case itself, as well as the changing dynamics during production, this is an understandable constant that Gibney had to build his structure around. This makes the film at times have the subtlety of a steamroller (Did you know that the Tour de France is a mad, mad, mad challenge to the body and the mind?). It's unfortunate, but such is life. This slightly disjointed aspect of the production makes certain individual scenes and moments stand out, yet they never quite come together. The lack of catharsis allows the viewer enough leeway to judge Armstrong for themselves, and that particular aspect of Gibney's film is much more fascinating than the \"arrogant-pillock-dopes-and-lies\" story. Indeed, Gibney's film shows that Armstrong was part of a much bigger hypocrisy. The use of the banned red blood cell booster EPO was not just widespread; it was almost universal. EPO remained undetectable for years, and Armstrong, many of his teammates as well as his opponents pumped their blood full of it, and enjoyed the occasional blood transfusion, also banned. The film implies that it would be hard to find anyone who was actually clean in the 1990-2005 period. So no one can actually point the finger too much.  Advertisement The problem with Armstrong was the way he aggressively chased down and sued (or threatened to sue) people who may have flagged up any alternative to the Armstrong-imposed narrative. There was plenty of evidence, but no one dared stand up to La Armstrong, the ultimate diva of pro cycling.  \"The Armstrong Lie\" also presents a very close relationship between Lance Armstrong and the International Cycling Union, cycling's governing board. The ICU and Armstrong had frequent conversations on the cyclist's latest drug test, with the board representatives amicably warning Armstrong how close he was to getting caught. Gibney doesn't elaborate on it and purposefully leaves it hanging, but he makes it seem not unfeasible that the whole controversy might have even involved the very head of the UCI. If anyone dared question him, the film shows, Armstrong retaliated with almost Biblical fury. Armstrong personally went after anyone who even insinuated that something fishy might have been going on. He was a scary, intimidating, and cold man. His story is not a tragedy in the classical sense. It's a cautionary tale with a very simple and obvious message: don't be an SOB. The Armstrong story is fascinating. That someone could get away with such a huge lie in plain sight is terrifying. It's a bit like the Jimmy Savile mess in the UK in that, to put it simply, people must have known! And some brave people did know and try to talk about it, but if one thing came out of the Armstrong debacle, it's the knowledge that telling the truth is one thing; finding someone to listen to you is quite another."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Words and Pictures", "Review": "If a picture is indeed worth a thousand words, this review would be just a selfie of yours truly looking sad and confused as the credits for \"Words and Pictures\" played in the background. Alas, I work in a medium driven by words, so to equal that picture, I\u2019ve got 950 words to go. Equating words and images is the major plot point of \"Words and Pictures.\" Two high school Honors program teachers oversee a student debate on which is more important, images or the written word. In the process, the teachers fall in love. It sounds like a romantic comedy with a little heft to it, until you discover that one teacher is so repellent that you root against the relationship. Adding insult to injury, the debate itself is given little screen time to develop. Advertisement \"Words and Pictures\" has a helmer I greatly admire, suitably cast actors I enjoy and a plot that sounds intriguing. Rom-coms are the hardest genre to employ without failure, but director Fred Schepisi made two successful ones: \"I.Q.,\" which I liked, and \"Roxanne,\" which I adore. Clive Owen had a roguish charm in \"Duplicity\" and Juliette Binoche provided what little convincing romance there was to be had in \"The English Patient.\" As a writer whose drawing skill makes Dr. Seuss look like Frank Miller, I was all set to root for words to win the big debate. Unfortunately, \"Words and Pictures\" fails at portraying both titular nouns. The screenplay by Gerald Di Pego (\"Phenomenon\") is full of subpar dialogue, one-dimensional characters, scenes that belong in a different movie, other scenes that belong in the trash, multiple rom-com sins of clich\u00e9 and a warped, stalkerish notion of what constitutes romance. When the hero\u2019s idea of a term of endearment to the heroine is \"you cold-hearted ice bitch,\" one wonders what he\u2019d say if he were pissed at her. Schepisi\u2019s direction is completely devoid of his usual style. Slant Magazine\u2019s Ed Gonzalez aptly describes it as \"unexpected point-and-shoot hackwork.\" Schepisi\u2019s camera is as disinterested in these people as we are; there must be a dozen of the same overhead shots of Binoche painting with a janitor\u2019s mop and an equal number of shots of Owen standing around and drinking from a lime-filled liquor glass. The classroom sequences are flat and static, even when Owen is screaming at his class to startle them.\u00a0 Even the climactic \"battle\" is shot for maximum blandness, which is appropriate for the big, misguided speech that accompanies it. Artistic professions are always used by Hollywood as psychological shorthand. Owen\u2019s English teacher, Jack Marcus, is a published writer, which automatically makes him an arrogant drunk. This is firmly in Owen\u2019s wheelhouse\u2014he did a good job playing Hemingway in HBO\u2019s \"Hemingway and Gelhorn\"\u2014but unlike Papa, Jack Marcus lacks any charm whatsoever. He\u2019s pushy, rude, mean-spirited, a bully, a potential blackmailer and a plagiarist. When a character threatens to kick him in the family jewels, you hope she does. When he goes before the school board to fight for his job after numerous drunken incidents, his knight in shining armor is his debate opponent, Miss Delsanto (Binoche). Advertisement Miss Delsanto was transferred from another school. She\u2019s a famous, successful painter, which automatically makes her aloof and cold. She constantly demands perfection without bothering to explain how her students can achieve it. She\u2019s artistically tormented, as all movie painters are, but at least she has a valid excuse in the rheumatoid arthritis that has robbed much of her ability to paint. Marcus antagonizes her immediately, and the refreshment of Miss Delsanto\u2019s original dismissal gives way to the tired old clich\u00e9 of falling for the scraggly-looking drunken jackass character we\u2019re supposed to love by default. It\u2019s Marcus\u2019 idea to declare \"war\" on Delsanto\u2019s art class, because she favors paintings over literature. He enlists his English class, some of whom are also in Miss Delsanto\u2019s class, to assist him in this game. The concept of words vs. pictures is poorly executed, and without this debate, there should be no movie. Yet the movie exists for long passages without once paying lip-service to this aspect of the plot. Instead, an unnecessary subplot regarding teenage sexual harassment draws an unintentional parallel between its disturbing harassment and the relationship between Marcus and Miss Delsanto. Marcus\u2019 star pupil, Swint (Adam DiMarco) spends every waking moment trying to hook up with Miss Delsanto\u2019s star pupil, Emily (Valerie Tian). He does this by relentlessly badgering her, calling her names like \"dim sum\" and other Asian stereotypes. (Is having a White character refer to an Asians as items off a Chinese take-out menu a new trend in screenwriting? STOP IT!) When, in a very effective scene, Emily screams in frustration to leave her alone, Swint resorts to drawing a dirty picture of her, which he then uses as a cyberbullying tool. Was this supposed to be a point \"scored\" for pictures? Swint\u2019s words were just as effective at creating torment. I questioned what I supposed to glean from this, until I saw Marcus\u2019 reaction late in the film. When Marcus\u2019 relationship with Miss Delsantos goes off the rails, as it must in a romantic comedy, he becomes as badgering and stalkerific as Swint. I doubt this was the filmmakers\u2019 intention, but that\u2019s how it played. There is one element of this film that works very well. Marcus\u2019 alcoholism has a major effect on his relationship with his son. Their conversations will hit home for anyone who has ever lived with an alcoholic. The looks of exasperation on Marcus\u2019 son\u2019s face rang true\u2014they were feelings I knew well. But as good as these few scenes are, \"Words and Pictures\" can\u2019t handle the shift in tone. It\u2019s as if the projectionist at a double feature of \"Days of Wine and Roses\" and \"To Sir, With Love\" accidentally mixed up the reels. But what about the debate, you ask? You\u2019ll be asking that a lot during \"Words and Pictures.\" The answer is not worth the wait. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Krisha", "Review": "Watching \"Krisha\" is a revelation: there are expected \"rules\" for such material (a former addict returns home for a holiday), but then director/writer Trey Edward Shults breaks every rule, making those\u00a0rules\u00a0seem tired and arbitrary in the process, and he does so with bravura, confidence, flash. While the style is in-your-face, every element of it (a show-stopping score by Brian McOmber, Drew Daniels' camera-work, Shults' editing) is in service to the story, and to the story beneath the story, how destroyed this family has been by Krisha's addiction. \"Krisha\" (which won the Grand Jury prize at the 2015 SXSW Film Festival) is an assault, from the first unforgettable moment on, and Shults' style clues you in from the get-go that this won't be your familiar \"addiction/redemption tale.\" This is going to be something very, very different. This tour de force is even more astonishing when you learn that it is Shults' first feature.\u00a0 Advertisement Krisha (Krisha Fairchild), an older woman with flowing grey hair and a body rolling with curves, returns to the family home for Thanksgiving, after presumably decades lost to addiction. (As she pulls up to the curb outside the house, the hem of her dress sticks out from the bottom of the car door. That detail says it all.) She's sober now and desperate to re-enter the family circle. Her presence at Thanksgiving is a test after years of letting everyone down and ruining family gatherings. She has promised to cook the Thanksgiving turkey, a big job (considering the number of people present), but she's happy to take on the responsibility because it will prove she's got her act together, she's a good girl now, they can trust her.\u00a0 The family gathered is multi-generational. There is Krisha's sister Robyn (Robyn Fairchild) and Robyn's technologically-challenged husband (who can't figure out his phone, his computer, or the remotes), their kids, the kids' spouses, cousins, plus a newborn, plus Krisha's ancient mother. The house is open on the first floor, rooms pouring into other rooms, a tiled floor with no rugs to absorb the noise. The voices bounce off the walls, total cacophony, creating a believable atmosphere of a rambunctious, close family. Krisha enters, and people line up to hug her, happy that this lost lamb might be on the right track finally. But there's a formal quality to the reunion. The family has been hurt deeply by Krisha. She has missed decades in their lives. One of the kids (Shults himself) keeps his distance, even when she clutches him to her. He pats her back stiffly, retreats.\u00a0 Over the course of the next couple of hours, Krisha prepares the turkey, (at one point the bandage on her finger\u2014a finger missing its tip from some unexplained catastrophe\u2014disappears inside the bird), sneaking out to smoke butts on the patio, or retreating to the bathroom upstairs to stare at herself in the mirror, trying to calm down. The cousins, all boys around the same age (high school and college), have arm-wrestling contests, watch football, sneak off to watch porn upstairs, play boardgames. The family has moved on without Krisha, the space she used to take up is no longer there.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Krisha\" is both realistic and deeply surreal. Shults leaps around visually, from the nephews wrestling in the yard, to Krisha tearing the kitchen apart looking for the oven-timer, the camera whirling around her in dizzying 360-degree turns, to Robyn and her husband having whispered worried pow-wows in the corner, as Krisha peeks at them anxiously. The noise is deafening inside the house, but the sound drops out when Krisha is alone. The frantic score would be appropriate for a horror film, and in a lot of ways \"Krisha\" is a horror film (the first moment evokes pure psychological terror).\u00a0 Cooking that turkey is a cliffhanger in and of itself. As the film hurtled on its rickety precarious rails, I kept thinking about the turkey in the oven. I wanted her to go check on it. It seemed so important that the turkey come out well. It wasn't just a turkey. It was life-or-death. Shults' immersive style drove that home in ways both funny and terrifying. The tension, at times, was unbearable.\u00a0 Krisha stands at the center, staring around her with wild eyes, desperate for a drink, for belonging and forgiveness. She's a tough-looking broad with a big belly laugh, but her hopes are hanging by a thread. \"You are heartbreak incarnate,\" declares her caustic brother-in-law. \"You are a leaver.\" Not only does he have a point, he is right. Krisha talks about learning to \"be a better person\" and how she has been trying to get in touch with her \"spirituality,\" but there's something \"off\" in her attitude, considering the damage she's done.\u00a0 Krisha Fairchild is Shults' aunt, who has done mostly voiceover work. To say her performance is \"good\" doesn't even cut it. It helps that she is an unknown face. She doesn't look like a Hollywood actress playing at being an addict. She looks like the real thing. Her mere presence calls into question the industry's casting choices: who else might be out there not getting work because of their body or their age? Krisha is a mess. She tries hard. She struggles into her way-too-fancy red dress for the upcoming dinner. She's buoyant and fragile, self-pitying, clueless. It's amazing just watching her, and Shults gives us multiple still moments where the camera stares at her profile, her reflection in the mirror, her face gazing out a window. The movie is all about her face. There are moments when she goes totally blank, a void in her eyes. It's deeply unnerving.\u00a0 Advertisement The story behind shooting \"Krisha\" is almost as extraordinary as the film itself. Shot over nine days in the Texas home of Shults' parents, the cast is made up of members of Shults'\u00a0family (most of them are not actors). In interviews, Shults and his family are quite open about the fact that the film is based on their shared experience with an addict relative.\u00a0The film feels like a blazing catharsis for all involved. Shults' mother (a therapist in real life) has a scene with Krisha in an upstairs bathroom that is so pained, so raw, that it puts other confrontation scenes in other films to shame.\u00a0 We all know how addiction narratives usually play out (at least in the movies). The addict shows up, there are tense scenes, shouting matches, maybe a relapse, but in the end, there is hope after all. People in the real world know that not every \"addiction tale\" has \"redemption\" at the end of it. How many chances are you supposed to give someone before you back off in self-protection? \"Krisha\" is not just about its main character but about the effect her alcoholism has had on the family. They are right to be wary of her. They are right to keep their distance. She really is \"heartbreak incarnate.\""}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Kiki", "Review": "In 1990, Madonna brought \"Voguing\"\u2014an exaggerated dance style started in the underground ballroom scene in Harlem\u2014to the mainstream with her mega-hit \"Vogue,\" a song that celebrates fantasy and escapism and beauty. Madonna hired dancers she had seen out in the New York club scene, and suddenly, that secret underground world of drag clubs and \"Harlem ballroom\" was on display at the MTV Awards and in the David Fincher-directed video of the song. That same year, \"Paris is Burning,\" Jennie Livingston's documentary about the Harlem dance club and drag scene, won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance. If anyone wondered where Madonna heard about \"voguing,\" the documentary was the answer. Now, 26 years later, comes Sara Jorden\u00f6\u2019s \"Kiki,\" another deep dive into the same scene. It's an intimate look at a marginalized community, many of whom rely on the various neighborhood clubs for support systems that don't exist anywhere else. The so-called \"Kiki\" scene is not just about the various competitive dance club contests. The scene provides a social structure, a \"net,\" for kids who have nowhere else to go. Advertisement Jorden\u00f6, a Swedish filmmaker, collaborated on the film with LGBTQ activist Twiggy Pucci Garcon (he gets a co-writing credit). Twiggy is a highly visible member of the ballroom scene, and his involvement was crucial in terms of providing Jorden\u00f6 access to a community that is highly protective (with good reason) of its members. The documentary has a high-energy and full-immersion style that thrusts you into the center of the various \"houses\" connected to the scene. Each \"house\" has a team that competes in the dance competitions. The dance competitors are mostly queer and trans people of color, and \"Kiki\" introduces you to many of them. \"Kiki,\" with all of its group scenes (kids Voguing on the Chelsea piersa common hangout, the raucous competitions themselves), is really a character-driven narrative. While there are similarities in many of their stories, each journey is different. Many of the young adults profiled have been kicked out of the house for being trans, queer, or just gender-nonconforming. They have gravitated towards one another, and immersed themselves in a culture that is nonjudgmental, open, and caring. They take care of each other. They crash on each other's couches. They have each other's collective backs. \"Paris is Burning\" highlighted the struggles of queer kids in the Reagan/Bush era, and \"Kiki\" shows the anxiety of the scene at the tail-end of the Obama years. Many of these people depend on federal funding. They are among the most vulnerable members of our society. They already experience an onslaught of harassment from family, peers, police. Many of them have fallen into addiction or sex work. There are support groups sponsored by each house, where people can talk openly about these issues. Twiggy is one of our main ways \"in\" to this closed scene, and you see him running warm-ups for rehearsals, and keeping everyone in line, reminding them of the stakes in the competitions. He is an activist, working for the homeless LGBT youths in his community, helping to provide structures of support and relief. Gia Marie Love emerges as the star of the film, however: a trans woman who has transformed herself from a bullied youth into a leader in her community. Watching her run a support group, it's not hard to understand why she was a debate club champion in high school. There's the soft-spoken Divo, kicked out of the house by his mother, who was\u2014as he admits freely\u2014saved by the ballroom scene. Advertisement One thing \"Kiki\" does really well is show how these dance competitions are an organizational structure for kids who might otherwise slip through the cracks. Everyone makes their own costumes, which are fantastical and outrageous. Taking place in school gyms and community halls, it's a safe space where people can let loose and express themselves, with no fear of harassment or rejection. This is a scene that takes care of its own. In many cases, it's literally life or death. Jorden\u00f6 makes a couple of directorial choices that repeat throughout: each person is seen standing on a city sidewalk, a pier, a street corner, staring directly at the camera, a vision of stillness that stops the film in its tracks, giving us a chance to breathe, to look. There are also a couple of scenes shot in an empty theatre, where the various dancers, bathed in blue light, show their stuff. It provides another perspective of these street kids, their ability to translate their fantasies of themselves into movement, elegant and elongated and exaggerated. The full-immersion style has its drawbacks. The characters are introduced early on, those the film will follow, but biographical details and \"confessional\" comments come late in the documentary. It takes a while to understand what is happening, and who is who. The jostle of names and information and intersecting relationships is a confusing bombardment.\u00a0 With music by Qween Beat, \"Kiki\" shows the new generation of the ballroom scene, their care for one another, their awareness of the struggles ahead, their determination to be themselves, against all odds. They are scared, but they are strong. They know what is right and they fight for it. \"Kiki,\" with all its rough glamour and rambunctious dancing, is a political film. These kids live it."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Lobster", "Review": "\"The Lobster,\" a black-hearted flat-affect comedy from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, making his English-language debut, presents a dystopian world where being single is a criminal act. A romantic breakup thrusts the \"single\" into the outer darkness of society. (Like all good satire, \"The Lobster\" is close enough to reality to disturb the waters.) A single person has 45 days after a breakup to find a new partner, and if the new partner does not materialize, the single person will be turned into an animal. The message is clear: Couples deserve official protection, and the privilege of being left alone by the unnamed State. Single people are accosted in public spaces with demands for appropriate papers. \"The Lobster\" plays rigorously by its own rules without once telegraphing \"Just kidding!\" While extremely funny, it is a bitter and ruthless film. Lanthimos plays target practice and his aim is deadly. Advertisement In its opening, David (Colin Farrell, in a wonderful performance) listens passively to the off-screen voice of a girlfriend, telling him it's over. The next scene shows David (dog in tow) checking into a hotel, answering a series of extremely intimate questions about his personal life. Not once does he balk. We don't understand the rules yet of this world, but David clearly does. (The script was co-written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, who collaborated before on \"Dogtooth\" and \"Alps\".) Soon the situation becomes clear: David has come to a facility where single people try to find a mate. No New-Agey retreat, this: the stakes are too high. There are callbacks to films as various as \"Defending Your Life,\" \"Never Let Me Go,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" and \"Safe,\" an institutionalized environment devoted to controlling the chaos of human emotions. There are expeditions in the forest, filmed in luxurious slo-mo, guests hunting each other down with stun guns, winnowing down the ranks. There are demonstrations in a lecture hall about the dangers of being single. (A woman walking by herself is attacked. A woman walking with a man is safe. And etc.) One night there is a dance, and a more joyless event could not be imagined. David befriends a couple of other inmates (no other word for it): a lisping man played by John C. Reilly and a limping man played by Ben Whishaw. Relationship rules require that the lisp-er mate with another lisp-er and the limp-er find another limp-er. It's a brutal fun-house-mirror of romantic compatibility. If every interaction contains the possibility of monogamy as well as societal-redemption, not to mention avoiding being turned into an animal, then personal connection becomes not only impossible but irrelevant. Colin Farrell gives one of his funniest and (strangely enough, considering the humorlessness of the character) charming performances since \"In Bruges,\" as David. David is baffled, obedient, depressed, defeated. Watch his face as he listens to other people's \"testimonies\" at group events. There's not a hint of self-awareness there. He has zero sense of the absurd. David is a mushy lukewarm pudding of a man. With his mustache and pot belly and nondescript glasses, Farrell is a completely believable everyman. \"The Lobster\" is narrated in a monotone by Rachel Weisz, who doesn't enter the film until some way in. The tone of the narration is key: It is as though Weisz is reading a love poem in botched translation by a third grader. She sounds like a child trying to talk the way she thinks adults talk. The term \"deadpan\" does not apply. The way people talk in \"The Lobster\" reveals a complete absence of nuance and subtext. How does one talk about emotions if one has no inner life? It would sound something like Weisz's voiceover in \"The Lobster.\" It's truly bizarre, with a devastating and comedic cumulative effect. Advertisement The second half of the film takes place in the forest surrounding the facility, teeming with random recently-human animals as well as a tough band of escaped \"Loners,\" their fierce leader played by L\u00e9a Seydoux. Seydoux gives a charismatic and terrifying performance, reminiscent of the \"children of Marx and Coca Cola\" in Jean-Luc Godard's early work, most particularly Veronique, the heartless redheaded revolutionary in \"La Chinoise.\" The freedom Seydoux represents is heady and deadly as pure oxygen. Her ideal is Kipling's Cat, who \"walked by himself ... through the wet Wild Woods, waving his wild tail, and walking by his wild lone.\" But in order for freedom like that to be possible, there must be rules. Lots of rules. Lanthimos is interested, here and in his other films, in the sometimes pathological human need for systems. Why wait for a totalitarian government to institute rules from the top-down when human beings submit to atomization of every aspect of their lives all on their own? If this \"need\" is wired into the human race, then where does that leave the individual? An individual who doesn't \"go along\" becomes a renegade, an outlaw, an unwelcome reminder that the system doesn't work for everyone. Lanthimos clocks the fact\u2014and relentlessly lampoons it with surgical precision\u2014that society values couples more it values single people. Valentine's Day, to a single person, can feel like living in a one-party State bombarding the populace with non-stop propaganda. Every magazine, commercial, movie, daytime talk show is a never-ending parade of relationship advice and aspirational examples of love winning out. Even the dropdown menu choices of \"Mr.\" \"Miss.\" and \"Mrs.\" forces individuals to state their relationship status (and, of course, men get to be \"Mr.\" whether they're single or not). It goes without saying that these everyday annoyances do not amount to \"oppression,\" but they are omnipresent enough that Lanthimos follows them out to their most extreme conclusions. What about \"opting out\" of all of it? But look out, freedom-seekers: Sociopaths like L\u00e9a Seydoux's character emerge out of power vacuums practically on schedule. The forest section of \"The Lobster\" doesn't work as well as the section in the facility, Seydoux's performance notwithstanding. Without the walls of the complex pressing in on the characters, the satire floats around in the air, searching for its proper landing-point. Lanthimos' real target is inside that facility. However, as \"The Lobster\" marches towards its conclusion, it becomes clear that it intends to go the distance. Lanthimos will not cop out on what his film has unleashed. In a world devoted to happy endings, where platitudes like \"the right person is out there waiting for you\" or \"someday your Prince will come\u201d are parroted as Unquestioned Truths, the film is a welcome breath of freezing cold, poisoned air.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "What Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy", "Review": "There is a force to be reckoned with inside David Evans' tiny documentary \u201cWhat Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy,\u201d a containment of the massively different convictions held by two dear friends. They are both the sons of senior Nazi officials, who were members of Hitler\u2019s army that had firsthand involvement with the genocide of the Jewish people in the Holocaust, and whose faces and names appear prominently in historical documents. Their family history is connected directly to the atrocities committed by the Nazi party. Advertisement One man, Niklas Frank, is at peace with what his father Hans Frank did, by openly expressing shame and disgust with the toxic ideology and the people who spread it throughout Europe. Once considered a prince of Poland when his father became governor general of the land, Niklas now carries around a picture of his father\u2019s dead body right after his execution, as a reminder of what happens when democracy and humanity perish from the Earth. At the very end of the film, when he sits in the courtroom where his father was sentenced to death, he states with a bit of peace, \u201cThis is a happy place.\u201d\u00a0 On the other side of the argument is Horst von W\u00e4chter, a man of equal amiability in the film\u2019s diner-conversation-level intimacy. For all of his life, Horst recognizes that terrible things have happened in Europe during the time of the Nazi regime, and is sympathetic to those who lost their lives or their lineages. But his own father, Otto von W\u00e4chter, who was ranked just a few notches below Niklas\u2019, and was in charge of transportation to the concentration camps, is not directly responsible for the atrocities. That is at least from Horst\u2019s perspective, who claims with an anxious tone that his father was a decent man. \u201cHe had no choice,\u201d he states. The degree of his denial is disturbing, and provides the unmoving rock that makes \u201cWhat Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy\u201d so poignant.\u00a0 The two men are brought together on this documentary occasion by an international lawyer, Philippe Sands comes from London but has his own personal history with the Holocaust\u2014his family was nearly wiped out by the genocide, his grandfather having escaped. Sands is the writer and executive producer of this endeavor, but unlike many people who put together a documentary with their face on it, he does not seem concerned with presenting himself in a particularly great light, but in servicing his agenda\u2014making Horst acknowledge the truth about his father, and renounce his love for his father. The key verb is \u201cmaking,\u201d as beyond screaming at him as you may want to when watching their nonetheless congenial interactions, Sands removes the distance between Horst and the truth. But the presentation, for example, of documents detailing von W\u00e4chter\u2019s war crimes does nothing. \u201cI have so many documents from people who knew him personally who said he was a decent character,\u201d Horst deflects.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cWhat Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy\u201d wields a power that towers above many other small movies. It may not be the large definition of cinematic, but it is still a true film. A fantastic scene involves the three men at a field where thousands of corpses are still buried. A single camera tactfully dances around them as they amble the disquieting space, the image aptly framed, on-the-fly, to maintain a breathless poetry (a triangle framing of the three men is particularly stunning). In other instances, over-the-shoulder shots are improvised, connecting an underlying idea from the film about what we see, as opposed to what we choose to believe. Evans\u2019 film is a rare doc that gives its characters space within very personal moments, but is sharp on how to convey their poetry to an audience. \u00a0 Though emblematically stubborn in its form, \u201cWhat Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy\u201d has an austere, gripping beauty that is often as sensational as it is reserved. It features personal footage not seen before of these men\u2019s Nazi families, and an entire college course\u2019s amount of essays about the psychology within a productive relationship to history, but it brandishes neither. And its centerpiece scene is one that like many of Sands' events, proves futile, but illuminates the magnitude within this story of three men talking. They are sitting at a speaking event, discussing their respective histories, but eventually the occasion takes its true shape of ganging up on Horst. Even the people in the audience try to crack him, but the opposing sides are merely talking at each other; Horst doesn\u2019t budge. \u201cWhat Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy\u201d doesn\u2019t just look to the horror of not getting closure, but that of our convictions killing conversation."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Tomb Raider", "Review": "Based on the 2013 video game, and featuring Alicia Vikander as\u00a0the latest incarnation of a character who's been around for 22 years, \"Tomb Raider\" surprisingly\u00a0plays like a throwback to the classic late-'80s/early '90s\u00a0era of action filmmaking, represented by the likes of \"Cliffhanger,\" \"The Last of the Mohicans,\"\u00a0the first couple of Indiana Jones films, and Jackie Chan's \"Armour of God\" series. From the animated prologue, wherein the title character's archeologist father, Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), tells of an ancient, cursed tomb supposedly containing the all-powerful, weaponizable\u00a0remains of the Japanese shaman queen Himiko, through its gracefully executed series of chases and emotional moments, to its finale set on a Pacific island riddled with booby-trapped ruins, \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0is much better and more original\u00a0than anyone could have expected.\u00a0 Advertisement Although it borrows\u00a0from the game (and, partially, its sequel) for structure and most of its key\u00a0action sequences, \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0never feels like a pointless companion piece to a work that was created for a different medium. I've never played the game this film is adapting, but I\u00a0had a great time watching the movie it inspired, thanks mainly to the\u00a0direction; the stunt choreography, which leans on real performers and props whenever it makes sense to; the emphasis on problem-solving one's way out of tight situations; and most of all,\u00a0the actors, who flesh out archetypal\u00a0characters who might have seemed cliched or merely flat on the page, and make them as real as they can, considering what sort of movie they're in.\u00a0 First among equals is Alicia Vikander with her faintly regal bearing. She's correctly cast as a woman\u00a0who's literally to-the-manor-born, but the\u00a0humility and sense of fair play that she exudes\u00a0makes you like rather than resent the character.\u00a0More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence.\u00a0Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls\u00a0herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral\u00a0performance, letting\u00a0out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or\u00a0gets slammed on the ground by a brawny\u00a0foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace. The movie has given a lot of thought to the question of\u00a0how a small woman could successfully fight opponents who are a lot\u00a0bigger and stronger than she is. The answers are relentless\u00a0speed, the strategic use of full body weight, and dirty fighting.\u00a0This is not to say that \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0is \"realistic\" in any sense, because no video game movie is\u2014at one point, Lara powers through after\u00a0a puncture wound that would put a 250-pound Green\u00a0Beret out of commission\u2014but that the filmmakers and Vikander are doing everything they can to sell the physical and emotional reality from moment to moment. Advertisement To that end, \"Tomb Raider\" is more emotionally demonstrative than films in this vein tend to be. As written by\u00a0Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons, there's\u00a0a strong element of domestic\u00a0melodrama at the heart of the tale: Lara's father went missing and is presumed dead. The movie gradually\u00a0fills out the\u00a0details of their relationship, balancing Lara's admiration, even worship, of her father\u00a0against the deep pain\u00a0caused by his frequent absences and ultimate disappearance. This is the story of a daughter learning from, surpassing, and ultimately forgiving\u00a0her dad\u2014a journey that hits fresher beats than you tend to get in genre films starring male heroes\u00a0whose fathers died, vanished, or disappointed them (although the third Indiana Jones movie deals in these themes, too).\u00a0 Paternal abandonment and its aftermath are at the heart of every character's story here.\u00a0Lu Ren (Daniel Wu), the alcoholic sea captain who ferries Lara to the island that contains Himiko's tomb, is dealing with his own daddy issues:\u00a0his same-named father once ran the boat, and ultimately vanished, too, which might account for why their relationship feels more brother-sister than romantic (they obviously\u00a0respect each other, but there's no sexual chemistry because the movie isn't interested in finding any). The bad guy, archaeologist turned corporate mercenary\u00a0Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins), is himself an absentee husband and father.\u00a0He's\u00a0spent seven years trying to locate Himiko's tomb at the behest of the mysterious Trinity organization, and feels great resentment toward the unseen master who's keeping him on the island\u00a0until he can complete\u00a0the job.\u00a0 Lara is an emotional person who has empathy for others and feels things deeply. I liked how you could hear the catch in her voice or see tears almost well up in her eyes as she deals with moments that cause her distress, because these details\u00a0affirm the validity of such a response, and confirm\u00a0that the movie isn't going to just graft a bunch of standard-issue, strong-silent tough guy cliches onto a female lead\u00a0and call it a day. There's more sensitivity and intelligence on display here\u00a0than there needed to be,\u00a0and while \"Tomb Raider\" doesn't go as far in this direction\u00a0as I\u00a0would've liked, the unmistakable effort means a lot. \u00a0Particularly striking is the moment after Lara kills someone for the first time: she sits next to the corpse for a long moment, looking psychically disturbed as well as physically exhausted. The act of\u00a0killing is presented in such a cavalier manner in so many action and adventure\u00a0films that it\u2019s a bit shocking to see it treated as if it means something. Advertisement In the end, though, this is a movie about a woman running, running, running, running, and then maybe\u00a0pausing just long enough to kill a man with a bow and arrow, defeat him in hand-to-hand combat, or solve a tumbler-styled puzzle that will open the stone door of a temple containing ancient treasures.\u00a0\"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0treats Vikander as a moving piece of sculpture, admiring her not in a sexually objectifying way,\u00a0but as one might an athlete.\u00a0When filming her in action, director Roar Uthaug (\"The Wave\")\u00a0often adopts the perspective of an especially kinetic videogame, shooting Vikander from a low angle as she races toward the camera, or from an elevated perspective looking at the back of her head and her shoulders, the better to appreciate Lara as she cuts a path through her world.\u00a0 There are at least five action sequences in this movie that rank with the best I've seen recently. The first is a\u00a0\"fox hunt\" on bicycles\u00a0through the streets of London which sees\u00a0Lara, who works as a\u00a0bike messenger before embracing her destiny as heir to her dad's legacy, leading a pack of her colleagues on a\u00a0chase through winding streets packed with cars and trucks. Another finds Lara diving off a cliff into a raging river; she catches herself before going over a waterfall by clinging to a rusted-out,\u00a0World War II-era bomber that's teetering\u00a0on its edge, then gradually moves over and through the rotting husk of the\u00a0plane, trying to get to the riverbank before the whole thing falls apart. (A great Indiana Jones-style moment: as she hears the buckling groan and sees the plane falling to pieces, she mutters, \"Really?\")\u00a0 There are frustrations here and there, mainly having to do with the plotting and some of the\u00a0supporting characters, who are lively and memorable but often lack one or two scenes that would've made them seem as mythically vivid as the material demands. (Vogel's misery is fascinating at first, but ultimately becomes tedious, and I\u00a0didn't like the way the film sidelined Ren during the final act.) Still, this is a beautifully crafted and unpretentious piece of action cinema, with a number of sequences that are as gorgeous as they are thrilling, and\u00a0a female hero who's as elegant\u00a0as she is deadly:\u00a0an ass-kicking Audrey Hepburn.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Gigantic", "Review": "On the basis of \"Gigantic,\" Matt Aselton can make a fine and original film. This isn't quite it, but it has moments so good, all you wish for is a second draft. Nor is it ever boring. You can't say that about a lot of debuts. I suspect he was trying too hard to be terrific and not hard enough to get organized. His hero, Brian Weathersby (the willfully bland Paul Dano), is a young and feckless mattress salesman. He was a late son in a tribe of unconventional brothers. When they all get together with Dad (Ed Asner) in the family's cottage in the woods, Dad bonds with him by consuming hallucinogenic mushrooms. How Brian would know he was hallucinating is a good question, because much of his life unfolds on the border of reality. Advertisement The Swiss mattress showroom occupies a vast upper floor of a warehouse. Into this space one day marches Al Lolly (John Goodman), a big man with a painful back problem. Brain shows him the high-end $14,000 mattress, which uses real horsehair, which is a big deal in the mattress universe. The mattress also inspires an inspection by Al's daughter, Harriet (Zooey Deschanel), a beautiful girl with startling blue-green eyes. Although you might expect to find her on magazine covers, she is as inward as Brian; they speak in minimalist murmurs, as when she asks if he feels like having sex with her, and he confides that he does. Later, he tells a friend that he doesn't know if he likes her or not. More accurately, probably, he doesn't know if he liked being jolted out of his lifelong dubiousness. Ever since he was a little boy, Brian has been obsessed with the idea of adopting a Chinese baby. He doesn't understand why. He just is. Harriet might upset that dream in some obscure way. She invites him to her home, and he enters into a strange world ruled by Al Lolly, a rich, opinionated eccentric, who is driven everywhere flat on his back in the rear of a Volvo station wagon. The great open spaces of their apartment have been decorated by spending a great deal of money on a limited selection of furniture. Brian's life is complicated by a berserk madman who ambushes him with assaults. This man seems imaginary, until Brian receives facial wounds that don't go away. To summarize: A loser mattress salesman with a peculiar father meets a beautiful lost girl with an eccentric millionaire father, is attacked by a loony while trying to evade love and adopt a Chinese baby. Does this sound like a screenplay, or a contest entry? In the U.K., it would be described as too clever by half, and \"clever\" is not a compliment over there. Advertisement The strange thing is, the characters are interesting. You could make a movie about them. That Brian's very sane mother is played by Jane Alexander is an example of how well the film is cast. The delicate relationship between Harriet and Brian is beautifully played by Deschanel and Dano, but the movie jars us out of it with bizarre sidetracks like a scene set in a massage parlor; it's intended as funny but is finally a tossup between odd and sad. \"Gigantic\" is an example of a certain kind of \"Sundance movie\" made after the ship has sailed. The pendulum is swinging back toward the more classical forms of filmmaking. It's not enough to add, \"oh -- and this homeless guy keeps attacking him.\" If you want a homeless guy, do something meaningful with him, as Mike Leigh did in \"Happy Go Lucky.\" Wackiness for its own sake is not a substitute for humor or much of anything else. And yet look at the things here that are really good: the conversation between Brian and Harriet in the doctor's waiting room. The way the parents take to the Chinese baby. The way that John Goodman modulates his performance to make Al Lolly a character and not a caricature. The way that Harriet falls asleep on the $14,000 mattress, and what they say after she wakes up. Matt Aselton's next film might be a marvel."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "For the Plasma", "Review": "\u201cFor the Plasma\u201d is a delightful oddity, an indie comedy\r\nwith sci-fi twists and an indecipherable plot. It\u2019s part Jacques Rivette, part Shane Carruth, and part Wes\r\nAnderson. It might be part Tommy Wiseau too. With deadpan line readings that\r\nseem purposefully affected, it\u2019s a film that plays with our instinct to look\r\nfor meaning in imagery, and the baggage we bring to a movie. In fact, that\u2019s\r\nwhat it\u2019s about\u2014someone trying to read images of the natural world as something\r\ngreater. She even says, and it could be to us as viewers as much as the character to whom\r\nshe\u2019s speaking, \u201cI just need you to look, to describe within the frame.\u201d For\r\nviewers hoping to assemble a greater meaning from multiple frames, \u201cFor the\r\nPlasma\u201d could be frustrating, but it\u2019s so likable from moment to moment that\r\nits seemingly purposeful lack of coherence is forgivable. Just enjoy the frame. Advertisement Shot on gorgeous 16mm on almost no budget, most of \u201cFor the\r\nPlasma\u201d takes place in a remote house in Maine, and the forest and bodies of\r\nwater that surround it. In this distant location, a woman named Helen (Rosalie\r\nLowe) monitors the area around her for forest fires, using CCTV to do so.\r\nCameras have been set up on trees in the surrounding areas, and Helen watches\r\nthe natural world through an \u201cunnatural\u201d device. Her friend Charlie (Anabelle\r\nLeMieux) arrives to help with the project, and learns that Helen has discovered\r\nthat she can predict changes in global financial markets by looking at the\r\ntrees through her cameras. She draws patterns in the morning\u2019s financial\r\nsections\u2014highlighting some words and blocking out others\u2014and then \u201csees things\u201d\r\nin the trees. She needs Charlie\u2019s help with the project, but issues of their\r\npast friendship surface, at first reminding one of films like \u201cQueen of Earth\u201d\r\nand Tribeca\u2019s \u201cAlways Shine,\u201d but \u201cFor the Plasma\u201d is not just a story about a\r\nunique female friendship. I haven\u2019t even mentioned the ghosts or the men in suits or the lighthouse\r\nkeeper.  Directors Bingham Bryant and Kyle Molzan playfully intercut\r\nimagery of coastal Maine with lo-fi security cameras and the footage they\r\nrecord. In a key, early conversation, Helen talks about her project to Charlie,\r\ndiscussing image vs. reality, and how meaning and intent change both. It\u2019s the\r\nimage of the tree versus the purpose of looking at the tree. She\u2019s been hired\r\nto look at the tree to prevent forest fires. She is looking at that image to do\r\nso. Does the meaning of watching change when the intention changes? If she\r\nreads about finance and puts that in her head, does it change the process? Do\r\nthings like \u201cwatching\u201d and \u201cintention\u201d have pliable purpose? And what is the\r\nintent we bring to a film? From the minute we see these two characters meet, we\u2019re\r\ntrained to try and figure out their relationship, inclined to discern what\u2019s\r\nbehind them and predict what\u2019s ahead, instead of just looking in the frame. The great, synth score by Keiichi Suzuki adds to the oddity\r\nof the project, but it\u2019s the awkward, stilted line readings that both enhance\r\nthe charming strangeness of it all, and seem almost purposefully Wiseau-esque\r\n(the minute I took that note the two leads inexplicably started tossing a\r\nfootball back and forth on a walk-and-talk \u2026 so). When the lighthouse keeper\r\nshows up with a flashlight that he only turns on his face when he talks, you\r\nhave to wonder if it\u2019s a bad performance or one that\u2019s directed\r\nto be purposefully off-putting. At one point, you can literally see him read\r\ncue cards as he delivers his lines straight to camera (and don\u2019t get me started on\r\nthe winking). It\u2019s as bizarre a performance as you\u2019ll see this year.\u00a0 Advertisement Some might understandably dismiss a film about a woman who predicts financial shifts from looking at images of trees, but we are a world that\r\nassigns meaning to images, especially when it comes to the way we analyze\r\nmotion pictures. The meta-oddity of \u201cFor the Plasma\u201d is certainly not for\r\neveryone, but it\u2019s such a charmingly strange film, a movie that feels devoid of\r\nthe cynicism that often plagues every genre from which it cribs, but\r\nparticularly modern sci-fi and low-budget cinema.

{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Review": "If nothing else, \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" reminds us that \r\nnostalgia is often used as a mandate for spectacularly lazy filmmaking. \r\nYes, I \r\ntoo loved the action figures, video games, cartoons, and previous \r\nlive-action commercials, I mean movies. But a \"Teenage Mutant Ninja \r\nTurtles\" film that's trying this hard to pander to my childhood love of \r\npizza, karate, and talking animals shouldn't be this imaginatively \r\nchallenged. We're talking about a film where exposition is dumped over \r\nviewers' heads in every other scene, action scenes are loud and \r\nuncoordinated, and every joke feels like it was scripted hastily in the \r\nvain hope that punch-up writers would later rewrite them. Instead of a fun and unchallenging limp down memory lane, \r\n\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" is an energy-sapping exercise in futility\r\n that will leave you begging for less. Advertisement In \"Teenage Mutant Ninja \r\nTurtles,\" an inquisitive reporter discovers that you can make an \r\ninherently absurd premise even more hard-to-swallow with a convoluted \r\nbackstory. Channel Six news anchor April O'Neil (Megan Fox) wants to be \r\ntaken seriously as a journalist, so she investigates a city-wide crime \r\nwave involving gun-toting bad guys called the Foot Clan. She becomes \r\neven more determined to follow this story after witnessing a mysterious \r\nvigilante stop a Foot robbery by chucking an industrial-sized shipping \r\ncontainer at the bad guys. She then discovers that this crime-stopping \r\nhulk isn't working alone, and that both she and her own late father have\r\n ties to this shadowy superhero that go as far back as 1999. So \r\nApril spends the first half of \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" \r\nestablishing how she's related to the Ninja Turtles\u2014disciplined \r\nLeonardo (voiced by Johnny Knoxville), hot-head Raphael (Alan Ritchson),\r\n goof-off Michelangelo (Noel Fisher), and geek Donatello (Jeremy \r\nHoward)\u2014and soft-spoken (but totally unsuspicious!) philanthropist Eric\r\n Sacks (William Fichtner). Fifty minutes later, conflict ensues. The\r\n fact that April's search for answers comprises half of the film's plot \r\nsuggests that the film's creative committee got so wrapped up in using \r\nher to relate their origin story's plot that they forgot what viewers \r\ncame to see. This is where the film's shock-and-awe maximalism (ie: \r\neverything bigger for no good reason) starts to make a soul-crushing \r\nkind of sense. You don't need to do much to impress viewers if you can \r\nimmediately overwhelm them. So these Turtles are bullet-proof, six-foot \r\ntall mountains of biceps and quads. Likewise, Foot leader Shredder \r\n(Tohoru Masamune) looks like a samurai-themed death metal band-leader \r\nwith an Edward Scissorhands fetish. And Turtles leader Splinter (voiced \r\nby Tony Shalhoub) looks like a cross between old man Groucho Marx and a \r\nfreakshow pinhead...with a three-pronged Fu Manchu mustache. Thanks to \r\nthe film's ill-advised use of post-converted 3D projection, you can get \r\nan up-close look at their freakish appearances. Likewise, the \r\nfilm's action scenes are all so frenzied so that director Jonathan \r\nLiebesman (\"Battle LA,\" \"Wrath of the Titans\") didn't waste time on \r\nchoreography, humor, or anything more than frantic motion. This is OK \r\nfor an introductory fight scene, when April can't clearly make out the \r\nTurtles beating up the Foot clan on a dark subway platform, but it \r\ndoesn't fly during a down-hill car chase that involves a Humvee, rocket skateboard and electric grappling hook things. Characters are \r\nroutinely shot out of focus and barely even covered competently, \r\nunceremoniously drifting in and out of the camera's frame. Advertisement The\r\n same is true of the film's winking jokes, joyless attempts to \r\nacknowledge and muscle past the film's inherent ludicrousness. This \r\nisn't a new tactic, but in previous cartoons, Michelangelo, the group's \r\ncomic relief, was at least funny. Here, Mikey's best scene is the one \r\nwhere he leads the group in beatboxing before a climactic (ie: \r\noverstuffed, and noisy) battle. But Fisher's just not naturally \r\ncharismatic, and the material he's given to work with is a joke without a\r\n punchline: look, hip-hop turtles, so much more wacky than martial artist \r\nturtles! This is a gag for people who don't have the attention span for \r\ngags just as \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" is nostalgia-bait for people\r\n that only need an excuse to regress. You already know whether or not \r\nyou're going to like this film, and that's kind of the problem."}

I decided to swear them off after the rather \r\ntoothless PG-13 version of \"World War Z\". And this is coming from an idolizer\r\n of George Romero\u2019s early and much-imitated body of work.  But\r\n it didn\u2019t take long for \"The Returned\" to establish itself as having more\r\n ambition than just being another excuse for flesh-eating monsters to \r\nrun amok while humans attempt to eradicate their organ-gorging kind.\u00a0 \r\nInstead, it is less of a horror flick and more of a suspense thriller with \r\nsci-fi elements that possesses both brains\u2013some sacrificed in messy \r\nfashion, of course\u2013and a heart, as it makes a statement about an \r\nimaginary social issue that reflects those conflicts facing our country \r\ntoday.  Advertisement Instead of, say, the haves\r\n vs. the have-nots or legislation against illegal immigrants, there is a\r\n battle between the healthy and the infected. A zombie outbreak that \r\nhappened a while ago that caused millions to die has since been \r\ncontained, thanks to a miracle of modern medicine. If caught in time, \r\nthose bitten can receive a daily shot to stave off their transformation \r\ninto snarling blood-thirsty fiends. These beings who find themselves in \r\nthis human-zombie limbo are known as the Returned and not everyone is \r\nhappy about their presence.  Exemplifying\r\n this new normal is Toronto couple Kate (Emily Hampshire, a near-ringer \r\nfor Parker Posey) and Alex (Kris Holden-Ried, a near-ringer for musician\r\n Richard Thompson). She is a doctor who specializes in treating the \r\nReturned and he is a talented guitar teacher who happens to be one of \r\nthe Returned. That they live in a fabulous high-rise condo with \r\nultra-modern furnishings and seem mad for each other lead us to believe \r\nthat such a situation might work.  Kate,\r\n who keeps her conflict of interest hidden from others at the hospital, \r\nover-confidently explains to the rightfully concerned parents of a young \r\nboy who must be injected every day for the rest of his life that, \r\n\u201cBeing one of the Returned is a privilege, not a curse.\u201d Of course, she\r\n is just setting herself up to be proven wrong.\u00a0  Sure\r\n enough, the supply of antiviral serum is in danger of being depleted. \r\nResearch is underway to create a synthetic variety but may not be \r\navailable as quickly as first thought. The pending drought increases the\r\n opposition to keeping the infected alive. Some want to quarantine these\r\n stigmatized survivors, while others stage protests against their very \r\nexistence. As matters worsen and \r\nviolence breaks out as the stock continues to dwindle, Kate\u2013who \r\nalready was getting\u00a0 Alex\u2019s supply under the counter\u2013decides it\u2019s \r\ntime to they go on the run and hide out with the help of their \r\nsupportive friends, who offer refuge at their remote chalet.\u00a0  Advertisement From\r\n there, \"The Returned\"\u2019s plot direction too often settles for being more \r\npredictable than its initial setup. I found myself thinking \u201cuh-oh\u201d \r\nagain and again as the story took another expected turn. Hint: If you \r\nwalk into an unmanned gas station in a zombie movie, chances are that \r\nnoise in the back room is probably a sign to flee, not a reason to check\r\n out what is going on. But \r\ndirector Manuel Carballo offsets the lack of surprise with such efficient suspense builders as propulsive music, ambient noise, \r\nrealistic lighting and judicious handheld camerawork while efficiently \r\nexplaining the science and politics behind what is happening. What is \r\nmost appreciated is the sense of everyday routine that he creates\u2013you \r\nfeel as if this could really happen right here, right now\u2013and the fact\r\n that the sensitive, low-key performances by Hampshire and Holden-Ried keep the viewer invested in what happens to their relationship. \"Warm \r\nBodies\" was one thing. But these are two adults trying to keep their love\r\n alive under horrible circumstances and it is compelling to watch."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "One Direction: This Is Us", "Review": "Morgan Spurlock made his name by questioning the power of corporate culture, casting a critical yet charismatic eye as the director and star of documentaries including his Oscar-nominated \"Super Size Me\" and \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.\"  With \"One Direction: This Is Us,\" Spurlock becomes a cog in the machinery. In chronicling the juggernaut of the British boy-band during their recent world tour, he presents a piece of propaganda as glossy and managed as similar depictions of The Jonas Brothers and Justin Bieber.  Advertisement Young, female fans of the fab five probably won't care, and the parents who are forced to accompany them to the theater probably won't mind. The lads are lively and likable, their songs non-offensive and interchangeably poppy. \"This Is Us\" does what it needs to do for its target audience. But anyone looking for actual substance or insight will be disappointed and maybe even a little bored with its repetitive nature.  For the uninitiated: The members of One Direction are former cast-offs from the British version of the singing competition \"The X Factor\" whom producer and media mastermind Simon Cowell threw together as a group in 2010. (Cowell is also a producer on \"This Is Us.\") Before they'd even cut their first album, they'd already established a massive following, thanks to the television exposure and the instantaneous global reach of Twitter.  They are a confection, held together by hair product and harmony. But you can see the allure of them; the 11-year-old in me, who loved Duran Duran lead singer Simon Le Bon, gets the giddy, giggly sensation they produce.  Harry Styles, a former Taylor Swift paramour, is the rakish one in the mold of a young Mick Jagger. Niall Horan, the lone Irishman, is the impish, playful one. Zayn Malik is a darkly gorgeous graffiti artist; half-Pakistani, he's also a practicing Muslim, a fascinating fact that \"This Is Us\" doesn't even bother to mention in passing. Louis Tomlinson, the oldest member at almost 22, has looks reminiscent of a young Frank Sinatra. And the heavily accented Liam Payne has an amiably goofy authenticity.  They are all of legal drinking age in England but you never see any of them say the word \"beer\" much less drink one. Same goes for cigarettes. The boys are all kept far, far away from the frenzied fans in every city they visit, while still remaining within audible screaming distance. You'd never know that any of them has a girlfriend\u2014Zayn recently got engaged, actually\u2014or even groupies. All the better to make them seem accessible, adorable.  Spurlock has said he intended for \"This Is Us\" to be his version of the groundbreaking Beatles film \"A Hard Day's Night.\" But while we see the members of One Direction running from mad throngs in the streets and enjoying wacky antics backstage between the high-energy 3-D concert performances, we never get a sense of them as real people with recognizable, human emotions beyond joy or gratitude. At one point, Liam laments that he wonders whether anyone will ever love him for him. Harry comes to closest to saying anything remotely negative when he acknowledges that he doesn't always love this life. And while they're all clearly talented, confident singers, we get no sense that any of them has a deep passion or drive to make music.  Advertisement Mostly, they marvel at the fact that they're just five regular lads having the time of their lives (and to their credit, they're not completely polished, acknowledging that they're terrible dancers and refusing to attempt 'N Sync-style choreography). They're just mates, they tell us. They're like brothers. Each of them utters something along these lines over and over again, along with appreciation for the devotion of their fans.  Spurlock might have omitted a few of these repetitive moments in favor of more lengthy exchanges between the guys about their fame and success. In a rare, seemingly candid scene\u2014staged, of course, but still\u2014Harry and Liam wonder what their lives would have been like if they hadn't auditioned for \"The X Factor.\"  Someday, we may get the true story of One Direction behind the scenes, full of fears and fights, egos and eccentricities. But today is not that day, and Spurlock is clearly not that storyteller."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Sunshine Superman", "Review": "\u201cHis purity was a very attractive quality,\u201d says an\r\ninterview subject of Carl Boenish, the subject of this intermittently\r\ncompelling but rather unfortunately titled documentary, directed by Marah\r\nStrauch. Boenish is\u2014okay, there\u2019s no point in being coy, the proper verb here\r\nis \u201cwas\u201d\u2014a founder of BASE jumping. BASE standing for \u201cbuilding,\r\nantenna, span, or Earth,\u201d that last meaning a cliff. I guess if you didn\u2019t\r\ncapitalize it or acronymize it the term would still make sense, as you\u2019re\r\njumping off or from something that isn\u2019t moving and hence could be considered a\r\nbase. In any event, whatever you\u2019re jumping from is pretty far up, and you\u2019re\r\nusing a parachute and/or wearing one of those glider getups. Don\u2019t look at me,\r\nI\u2019m afraid of heights.  Advertisement But Boenish sure as hell wasn\u2019t. The movie chronicles his\r\nlove of skydiving from a very early age. He wasn\u2019t just in love with the fall\r\nthat simulated flying, he was passionate about chronicling what one saw from\r\nstarting way up and shooting straight down. Boenish was a cinematographer who\r\nworked with director John Frankenheimer on his skydiving movie \u201cThe Gypsy Moths,\u201d\r\non which another BASE jumping pioneer, Todd Higley, worked. (Higley does not\r\nfigure in this film.) Some of the best stuff in the movie derives from\r\nBoenish-shot footage\u2014heights may be scary but they do tend to furnish some\r\nspectacular views.  Eventually, Boenish drifted away from Hollywood and pursued\r\njumping full time, and with evangelical zeal. He started doing jumps off of Los\r\nAngeles skyscrapers, much to the consternation of the buildings\u2019 owners. In\r\ninterview footage he evinces a blithe, borderline glib disregard for rules of\r\nall sorts. Later in the film, we learn that Boenish had trouble walking fast\r\nand far because he\u2019d broken his leg in one exploit, and refused to have it set\r\nbecause he was a Christian Scientist. I found it curious that he had so little\r\nregard for convention in one case, and stuck to the letter of religious\r\ndoctrine under circumstances that must have caused him extreme pain. The movie\r\ndoesn\u2019t find this curious at all. The subject matter increasingly suggests a\r\nkind of cross between \u201cMan On Wire\u201d and \u201cGrizzly Man,\u201d but unlike \u201cGrizzly Man\u201d\r\ndirector Werner Herzog, director Strauch has little interrogative spirit.\r\nThere\u2019s no interest in exploring Boenish\u2019s contradictions.  The interviewee who notes Boenish\u2019s purity is his wife,\r\nJean, who it seems turned out to be his greatest and most devoted disciple. The\r\nfilm\u2019s last section focuses on a fateful 1984 trip to Norway, where Boenish\r\njumps from a cliff face for a \u201cGuinness World Records\u201d television special\r\nhosted by David Frost and young Kathie Lee Johnson, now Kathie Lee Gifford and\r\na rather more seasoned and terrifying TV presence. (Neither Frost, who died in\r\n2013, nor Gifford, who appears to be alive, was interviewed for the film.) The\r\njump recorded for the television special goes off flawlessly, while a jump\r\nBoenish does just for the heck of it does not. The editorial choices in this\r\nsection go more than a little slack; we hear about Boenish\u2019s bum leg more than\r\nthree times in less than ten minutes. Reflecting on the events thirty years later,\r\nJean has no apologies: \u201cEveryone has his own real way of reacting. It will be\r\nindividual. And BASE jumping encourages people to think as individuals\u2026\u201d BASE\r\njumping is now considered a legitimate \u201cextreme\u201d sport, and Boenish\u2019s widow\r\nthinks this is all well and good; extreme experience, she says, \u201cis not unique\r\nto BASE jumping. BASE jumping is just a condensed version.\u201d By this time in the\r\nfilm, the dramatic reenactments of events had grown pretty thick, which tried my\r\npatience; I also have to admit I found Jean Boenish\u2019s philosophical musings\r\nless than persuasive. And I don\u2019t think my fear of heights was the reason for\r\nmy bias.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Edge of Tomorrow", "Review": "\"Edge of Tomorrow\" is less of a time travel movie than an experience movie; that statement might not make sense now, but it probably will after you've seen it. Based on Hiroshi Sikurazaka's novel \"All You Need is Kill\", it's a true science fiction film, highly conceptual, set during the aftermath of an alien invasion. Maybe \"extra-dimensional being invasion\" is more accurate. The fierce, octopod-looking beasties known as Mimics are controlled hive-mind style by a creature that seems able to peer through time, or rupture it, or something. When the tale begins, we don't have exact answers about the enemy's powers (that's for our intrepid heroes to find out), but we have a solid hunch that it can see possible futures through the eyes of specific humans, then treat them as, essentially, video game characters, following their progress through the nasty \"adventure\" of the war, and making note of their tactical maneuvers, the better to ensure our collective extermination.\u00a0 Advertisement Tom Cruise, who seems to be spending his fifties saving humanity, plays\u00a0Major William Cage, an Army public relations officer. Cage is a surprising choice for the role of hero. He's never seen combat yet inexplicably finds himself thrown into the middle of a ferocious battle that will decide the outcome of the war. The film begins with Cage en route to European command headquarters in London, waking up in the belly of a transport chopper. The rest of the movie may not be his dream per se, but at various points it sure feels as though it is. The world is wracked by war. Millions have died. Whole cities have been reduced to ash heaps. The landscapes evoke color newsreel footage from World War II, and much of the combat seems lifted from that era as well.\u00a0 When Cage meets the general in charge of that part of the world's forces, he's told he's being sent right into this movie's version of D-Day and is to report for duty immediately. No amount of protest by Cage can halt this assignment, and soon after he joins his unit and learns the rudiments of wearing combat armor (this is one of those science fiction films in which soldiers wear clumping bionic suits festooned with machine guns and other weapons) he dies on the battlefield. Then he wakes up and starts all over. Then he dies again and starts over again. He always knows he's been here before, that he met this person, said that thing, did that thing, made a wrong choice and died. Nobody else does, though. They're oblivious to the way in which Cage, like \"Slaughterhouse Five\" hero Billy Pilgrim, has come unstuck in time.\u00a0 Cage's only allies are a scientist (Noah Taylor) who believes the creatures are beating humanity through their mastery of time, and\u00a0Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), an Audie Murphy or Sgt. York type who's great for armed forces morale in addition to being an exceptionally gifted killer. Rita has experienced the same temporal dislocation that Cage is now experiencing, but at a certain point it stopped. She recognizes his maddening condition but can no longer share in it. She can, however, offer guidance (and a key bit of information that defines his predicament), and speed up the learning curve by shooting him in the head whenever it becomes obvious that they're going down a wrong road that'll lead to the same fatal outcome.\u00a0 Advertisement Although the film's advertising would never dare suggest such a thing, for fear of driving off viewers who just want the bang bang-boom boom, Cage is a complex and demanding role for any actor. It is especially right for Cruise, in that Cage starts out as a Jerry Maguire-type who'll say or do anything to preserve his comfort, then learns through hard (lethal) experience how to be a good soldier and a good man. He changes as the story tells and retells and retells itself. By the end he's nearly unrecognizable from the man we met in the opening.\u00a0 Cruise is hugely appealing here, not just in the early scenes opposite Gleeson in which he's in Tony Curtis mode\u2014he's always fantastic playing a smooth-talking manipulator who's sweating on the inside\u2014but later, where he exhibits the sort of rock-solid super-competence and unforced decency that Randolph Scott brought to Budd Boetticher's westerns. He was always likable, sometimes perfect in the right role, but age has deepened him by bringing out his vulnerability. There's an existential terror in his eyes that's disturbing in a good way, and there are points in which \"Edge of Tomorrow\" seems to simultaneously be about what it's about while also being about the predicament of a real actor trying to stay relevant in a Hollywood universe that's addicted to computer generated monsters, robots and explosions. Cruise deserves some sort of acting award for the array of yelps and gasps he summons as he's killed by a Mimic or shot in the head by Blunt and then rebooted into another version of the story. The rest of the cast has less to do because this is Tom Cruise's movie through-and-through, but they're all given moments of humor, terror or simple eccentricity. Taylor often gets cast as brilliant but haunted or ostracized geniuses, and he's effective in another of those roles here. Gleeson, as is so often the case, invests a rather stock character with such humanity that when the character's motivations and responses change, you get the sense that it's because the general is a good and smart man and not because he's just doing what the script needs him to do. Emily Blunt is unexpectedly convincing as a fearless and elegant super-soldier, and of course a magnificent camera subject as well. Director Doug Liman is so enamored with the introductory shot of her rising up off the floor of a combat training facility in a sort of downward facing dog yoga pose that he repeats it many times. The film's only egregious flaw is its attempt to superimpose a love story onto Cruse and Blunt's relationship, which seems more comfortable as a \"Let's express our adoration for each other by killing the enemy\" kind of thing.\u00a0 Advertisement There's no end to the number of films and novels and other sources to which \"Edge of Tomorrow\" can be likened. \"Groundhog Day\" seems to be everyone's reflexive comparison point, but Liman's elaborately choreographed tracking shots and unglamorously visualized European hellscapes evoke \"Children of Men,\" the creatures themselves have a touch of the Sentinels from the \"Matrix\" films, and the monsters-vs.-infantry scenes will remind you of James Cameron's \"Aliens\" and its literary predecessor \"Starship Troopers.\" (Bill Paxton, one of the stars of \"Aliens,\" plays Cage's drill sergeant, a mustachioed Kentucky hard-ass with an amusingly sour sense of humor.) \u00a0 It's also an exceptionally brutal film, so bone-and-skull-crushingly violent and fairy-tale frightening that its PG-13 rating is stupefying. Parents should avoid taking young children who'll be both confused by the fractured narrative and terrified of the Mimics, nightmare creatures that look like razor-tentacled squid and roll across the landscapes like tumbleweeds. In all, though, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is its own thing. One of its most fascinating qualities is its keen judgement of the audience's learning curve. The early sections of the film repeat scenes and dialogue until you get used to the idea of the story as a video game or movie script, but just when you start to think, \"Yes, I get it, let's move on,\" the film has in fact moved on and is now leaving things out because they're not necessary. By the end of the movie the script\u2014which is credited to Christopher McQuarrie and Jez and John Henry Butterworth\u2014has gotten to the point where it's tactically withholding information and waiting for us to figure things out on our own. It repeats key images and lines near the end as well, but always for good reason. When you see the familiar material again you feel different about it, because its meaning has changed. The movie has an organic intelligence and a sense that it, too, exists outside of linear time. It seems to be creating itself as you watch it."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Martian", "Review": "\"The Martian,\" Ridley Scott's film about an astronaut surviving on a desolate planet, is at heart a shipwreck story, one that just happens to take the form of a science fiction adventure. But although the outline offers no surprises, the details and the tone feel new. Like all the variants of \"Robinson Crusoe\"\u2014including \"Cast Away\" and, of course, \"Robinson Crusoe on Mars\"\u2014this film is about a man, Matt Damon's Mark Watney, who summons all of his ingenuity and courage to endure a seemingly impossible situation, then must deal with loneliness on top of it all. If you've ever seen a film, you know going in that things are going to turn out fine for Mark\u2014that no studio is going to pay for a special effects driven epic about a smart, likable castaway who dies in the last five minutes. You also know that, despite the Lone Man Against Nature plot line, there's a reason why the filmmakers cast Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain as the captain of the mission that's forced to abort its exploration of the planet's surface and leave Mark for dead\u2014and it wasn't so that she could turn tail and head for Earth with her crew in the first ten minutes and never return. You also know that, despite the heated discussions back on earth of how risky, time consuming and expensive a rescue mission would be, NASA will still have to stage one, and that any objections (mainly by Jeff Daniels' character, the agency's director) will be waved off in the name of doing what's right. Since what will happen is never in question, all that remains is \"how.\" Advertisement Fortunately, the hows are cleverly envisioned by Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard (who adapted Andy Weir's source novel, and also penned \"The Cabin in the Woods\" and many episodes of ABC's castaway drama \"Lost\"). The film pays thoughtful attention to basic questions like, \"What do you do if the face plate of your helmet cracks?\" and \"How do you create a food supply on a planet that can't sustain plant life?\" The short answers to those questions are, respectively, \"apply duct tape\" and \"grow potatoes in a makeshift greenhouse fertilized with the solid waste left behind by the rest of the crew.\" Throughout the course of this long but never dull film, Mark makes for an affable and centered lead character\u2014a wisecracking botanist who talks constantly to himself (and by extension the audience) in video diary entries, and sees each new crisis as a problem solving exercise, provided he can get his fear and despair under control long enough to think straight, which of course he does. I'm making it sound as though \"The Martian\" is predictable. It is, but that doesn't hurt its effectiveness. The most fascinating thing about the film is how it leans into predictability rather than make a show of fighting it. In the process, comes up with a tone that I don't believe anyone has summoned in this genre, certainly not at this budget level. Of all the stories you've seen about astronauts coping with the aftermath of disaster\u2014including \"Mission to Mars\" and the visually superior and more aggressively melodramatic \"Gravity,\" which is more of a self-help parable with\u00a0 religious overtones\u2014\"The Martian\" is the most relaxed and funny, and maybe the warmest. Strangely like \"Alien,\" Scott's breakthrough 1979 thriller, and maybe \r\nhis follow-up \"Blade Runner\" as well, \"The Martian\" makes the future \r\nlook at once spectacular and mundane. For all its splendors, the world \r\nthat enfolds the characters is simply reality: the time and space in which they happen to be living.\u00a0 At times it seems as if the movie's greatest artistic inspiration is not any particular previous film or novel, but the second act of \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" which features endearing images of Dr. Heywood Floyd anxiously reading the instructions on a zero gravity toilet, and sleeping on a Pan Am flight to an orbital space station like a businessman taking the red eye from Los Angeles to New York. Much of the film's soundtrack consists, hilariously, of disco, the only music available to Mark (via his captain's abandoned laptop). The juxtapositions of Scott's panoramic red-brown landscapes, Damon's grimy, stubbly face, and 1970s dance floor classics like \"Turn the Beat Around,\" \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Rock the Boat\" are sublime. They make Mark's predicament seem like an elevated version of a tedious but necessary task, like tiling a roof or repainting a garage. Hard work always seems to go faster when you put some tunes on. Advertisement \"The Martian\" occasionally plays like an unscripted TV show \r\nabout a man stranded on another planet. There's a touch of \"How to\" in the\r\n way Scott and Goddard tell the story. As Mark talks to himself, he \r\nwalks us through his processes, showing how, for instance, he re-liquefies \r\ndried-out waste and mixes it into arid Martian soil, then inserts halved\r\n potatoes into crop furrows and waits for a sprig of green to appear. \r\nCost-benefit analysis constantly comes into play, as when Mark drives several hundred kilometers in a rover to dig up tech left \r\nover from another Mars mission, and has to decide whether to turn off \r\nthe heat in the cockpit to save power during the long journey (he \r\ndecides against it, because even though the heater eats up juice, he \r\ncan't function if his nether regions are frozen).  Chiwetel Ejiofor's Dr. Vincent Kapoor, the head of NASA\u2019s Mars missions, wants to bring Mark home out of a sense of honor and obligation. All of the other characters\u2014including Chastain's Capt. Melissa Lewis, Daniels' Teddy Sanders, and Teddy's morally indignant right hand man, Mitch Henderson (played by Sean Bean, the ideal actor to play a man of conscience)\u2014are basically on the same page. It's not a question of whether everyone wants to do the crowd-pleasing and heroic thing, but whether it's possible. It takes a while just to get a radio message to Mars and back, and you can't just send a spacecraft there like you'd overnight-mail a birthday gift. The mission has to be prepared for, and paid for. That can take months or years. At one point the NASA people discuss whether to skip safety inspections on an unmanned flight in order to make a particular calendar window.  The NASA technicians, \r\nscientists and managers race against the clock, working through \r\nequations on wiper boards and worrying about money and fuel and safety \r\nissues, but for the most part they talk to each other without hysteria.\u00a0 They say impulsive things, and then have to apologize. They crack jokes. Some of the exchanges verge on workplace \r\ncomedy. Much of Scott's reputation rests on his ability to conceive and \r\nexecute elegant images, often in service of grim stories, so it's easy\r\n to forget how good he is at camaraderie and banter (see \r\n\"Thelma and Louise\" and \"Matchstick Men,\" among others). \"The Martian\" \r\nfuses these sides of his talent better than any film he's directed. At its \r\nbest, it has the serene assurance of a Howard Hawks buddy adventure in \r\nwhich no predicament is so dire that it can't still feature a bit of \r\nlight humor.\u00a0 Advertisement The characterizations start out feeling a bit vague and flat, but deepen \r\nthrough the accumulation of little details. Even supporting players who \r\nshow up for a scene or two have a life force, such as Donald Glover's \r\nRich Purnell, a brilliant but eccentric young scientist who lives so \r\ndeep inside his own head that he doesn't know the NASA director's name.\r\n One of the best scenes finds Kapoor and communications expert Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) interpreting the inflection of Mark's typed response to a radical scheme to rescue him: \"Are you f-----g kidding me?\" Kapoor hopes that Mark meant to indicate excitement at NASA's audacity, but deep down he knows that's probably not it.  The film's ecstatic peak is its most counter-intuitive sequence, a music montage near the climax that interrupts the flow of the rescue action to show the astronauts on Mark's old spaceship contacting their loved ones via satellite video: a husband shows his wife a record album that he bought for her birthday, and a father delights his kids by floating through the spaceship's interior in zero gravity, swallowing water globules like a porpoise going after minnows. Billions gather to watch the the rescue on live TV at the end, but nowhere else do we get the impression that all \r\nother drama has ceased while humanity frets \r\nover Mark's fate. For\r\n Mark it's life or death, but we infer that there are \r\nlong stretches when the public has forgotten that he's stranded. The most significant recurring images in the film are closeups of sprigs sprouting from the potatoes that Mark buried in his greenhouse. Life goes on no matter what."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Fading Gigolo", "Review": "As an actor, John Turturro is a stalwart, alert, engaging character player. As a writer/director, he\u2019s one of the quirkiest, hit-and-miss narrative moviemakers around. (You may or may not remember his fevered musical \"Romance And Cigarettes,\" which opened with James Gandolfini singing an Englebert Humperdink hit while garbage men danced behind him.) His new picture, \"Fading Gigolo,\" in which Turturro also plays the title role\u2014a fellow floridly named Fioravante\u2014is packed with his signature soulful eccentricity from the ostensibly ridiculous premise down. Advertisement It isn\u2019t only that Woody Allen plays Murray, Fiorovante\u2019s lifelong pal who suggests that Fiorovante sleep with Murray\u2019s wealthy dermatologist for money, and then becomes, well, Fiorovante\u2019s pimp. It\u2019s also that Murray lives with a younger African-American woman (Jill Scott) and is pretty much a father figure to her four hilarious young boys. (The back-story of this arrangement is never given, which is fine.) Early in the picture Murray has to have one of the kids\u2019 head checked for lice, and he takes all four boys on a journey to the Hassidic section of Williamsburg, which raises some eyebrows among the locals. Now the site of white-haired Woody Allen leading a passel of young black kids along a sidewalk of black-and-white-clad men replete with payot and such may be uproarious to some. It may be appalling and even morally offensive to others. But I think everyone can agree that as a cinematic sight it is inarguably unusual.  In the meantime, Turturro\u2019s Fiorovante, with his big soulful eyes and his sensitive lovemaking technique and quiet multi-lingual erudition and his flower-arrangement skills\u2014the guy really is the whole package\u2014is providing satisfaction for a wide range of women, whose ranks include Sharon Stone (splendidly understated) and Sofia Vergara (who it\u2019s nice to see not playing a cartoon). He\u2019s bringing in lots of dough, and soon Murray gets the bright idea to set up Fiorovante with Avigal, the relatively young and terribly lonely widow of a rabbi (and also a head lice expert, since you asked), who\u2019s played, in the movie\u2019s oddest casting coup, by French pop singer and actress Vanessa Paradis. This plot development threw the sweet and odd movie off the rails for me a little while. As played by Allen, Murray is a milder, kinder, more competent version of a character Allen played himself in his earlier, funnier movies. He\u2019s out of luck (he has to close down his rare book store), a bit opportunistic (obviously) and constantly wisecracking. But the idea of setting up a Hasid widow with a male prostitute, even a male prostitute as soulful as Fiorovante, struck me as so ill-advised to be practically cruel. The awkward initial encounters between Fiorovante and Avigal didn\u2019t do much to ameliorate that impression, although the movie does find its feet again as the characters begin to fall in love (the de-boning-a-whole-fish sequence is absolutely classic, trust me on this). At this point, the Hasid cop played by Liev Schreiber, who\u2019s long loved Avigal, takes action against the funny business he suspects is going on, and the movie becomes an odd Orthodox slapstick narrative, while falling back on the tiresome movie convention about sexual performance being inhibited by the fact that one loves another from the one that one is currently delivering the business unto. Oh well. Advertisement Shot by Marco Pontecorvo with the kind of light that, for me at least, evokes the enchanted corners of Manhattan and Brooklyn as they were thirty or forty years ago, enlivened with a score featuring many lovely vintage jazz recordings by warm tenor Gene Ammons, \"Fading Gigolo\" is a New York story through and through (pace, the jazz experts who know Ammons to be of the Chicago school), often funny, sometimes moving, occasionally goofy as hell. With my objective critic hat on, I have to admit that it\u2019s not really a home run, but as an aging urban dweller it hit some notes both antic and plangent for me. If you\u2019re a fan of any of the cast members it might well do the same for you."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle", "Review": "It\u2019s hard to say whether \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,\u201d about a group of teenagers who turn into videogame characters, is a sequel to the 1995 Robin Williams hit \u201cJumanji,\u201d a remake, a reboot, or something else. But it\u2019s definitely the kind of movie that works the name of a classic rock song into its title and makes sure to blast it during the end credits, so that people who were in their twenties during the 1990s and now have kids of their own (and probably took them to this film) can feel that Pavlovian tingle.\u00a0 Advertisement That description makes the new \u201cJumanji\u201d sound like a cash-grab, and in lot of ways it is\u2014studios are so enamored with the notion that pre-existing intellectual properties are box office insurance that they\u2019re far more likely to greenlight this than something genuinely new, even though exactly no one has spent the last two decades saying, \u201cI wish somebody would make another \u2018Jumanji.\u2019\u201d At the same time, though, this is a\u00a0likable, funny diversion, and sometimes more than that. It has enough twists and surprises to pull viewers along, despite the fact that writer-director Jake Kasdan\u2019s story (co-written with four people) is ultimately not much meatier than the one from a 1990s videogame that the characters end up inhabiting after getting sentenced to a \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d-type detention at school. (In the original film, the titular diversion is an old-fashioned board game, just like in the source material, Chris van Allsburg\u2019s popular children\u2019s book.) The protagonists here are\u00a0Spencer (Alex Wolff), an earnest nerd; Spencer\u2019s onetime best friend Fridge (Ser\u2019Darius Blain), a football star who ends up grounded after authorities realize Alex wrote a homework assignment for him; Bethany (Madison Iseman), a classic snotty Heather-type who\u2019s addicted to her smartphone and takes selfies constantly; and the bookish, socially anxious Martha (Morgan Turner). They all have insecurities and issues. Once they end up inside the Jumanji videogame, these same characters are played by Dwayne Johnson (as Spencer the nerd); Kevin Hart (as Fridge the jock); Karen Gillan (as the super-fit avatar of Martha), and Jack Black, of all people, as Bethany. There are supposed to be five characters in the game-space, though, and we meet the fifth in due time: Alex Vreeke (Nick Jonas), who is introduced as an energetic teenager in the film\u2019s 1996 prologue, only to get sucked into the game and become The Local Missing Boy whose endlessly grieving family still lives in their now-decrepit house.\u00a0 The body-switching gag threatens to wear out its welcome quickly (hah ha, the scrawny nerd looks like Dwayne Johnson now, and the awkward girl has washboard abs!), but the actors take their assignments to play teenagers so seriously that the film surfs along on a wave of poker-faced earnestness, mixing moments of pathos in with its super-broad slapstick. (Except for Dan Castellaneta\u2019s Homer Simpson, nobody screams in pain more hilariously than Kevin Hart.) At certain points you might feel as though you\u2019re watching the longest, most lavishly produced \u201cSaturday\u00a0Night Live\u201d sketch ever, complete with lush jungle scenery (the film was shot partly on location in Hawaii) and attacks by CGI hippos, rhinos, monkeys, crocodiles and the like.\u00a0But since the entire thing plays like a 10-year old\u2019s Disney Channel fantasy of what adolescence will be like, it works well enough, especially when coupled with intense discussions of the game\u2019s rules (how many lives you get, how many levels there are, how to lift the curse from the land, etc).\u00a0 Advertisement Both the videogame\u2019s construction and its gender politics are very \u201890s. The movie is aware of this and makes fun of it, though there\u2019s a bit of an eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too aspect to the way it puts Johnson and Gillan's bodies on display. There are occasional jolts of mayhem, thanks mainly to the motorcycle-riding ninjas who do the bidding of the movie\u2019s villain John Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), a demonic figure who wants to control the Jaguar\u2019s Eye and claim dominion over the land. The action scenes are constructed with a bit of panache and manage to be exciting though you\u2019re never seriously worried that any major character is going to lose all of their lives. Kasdan, a veteran filmmaker who happens to be the son of \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d and \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, has an old-school sense of how to build those kinds of sequences. The shots are thoughtfully composed, for the most part, and you always know where you are and what's at stake from moment to moment. The script\u2019s scenarios allow for charming, often faintly surreal funny character moments, as when Black\u2019s round yet flouncy Bethany instructs Gillan\u2019s super-fit but still physically awkward Martha on how to be sexy. Black\u2019s \"hey, sailor\" walk evokes Bugs Bunny in drag, and Gillan\u2019s subsequent \u201cseductive\u201d dance to distract some guards looks as if she\u2019s trying to shake sand out of her shorts while simultaneously dealing with a bad case of swimmer\u2019s ear. The film doesn\u2019t have the nerve to follow some of its more subversive ideas (such as Bethany lusting after Alex) to their logical conclusions, probably because this is an expensive project that\u2019s terrified of alienating a certain sector of the public (imagine the walkouts if Jack Black lip-locked with Nick Jonas in something other than a CPR situation). But it\u2019s still more surprising in more ways than it had to be, and the performers are clearly having such fun playing insecure teenagers that you stay involved even when the thinness of the enterprise becomes undeniable. This is a two-and-a-half star movie, honestly, bumped up a notch because the actors are likable, the film doesn\u2019t have a cruel thought in its head, and the sentimental finale feels earned."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Lowriders", "Review": "Ricardo de Montreuil\u2019s \"Lowriders\" tells an age-old story of intergenerational conflict, set within a very contemporary slice of Los Angeles. Fathers and sons can\u2019t see eye to eye, even though they have more in common than they\u2019d like to admit. Longstanding resentments simmer and eventually boil over. As the song goes, parents just don\u2019t understand. You\u2019ve seen these stories and themes trotted out a million times before, but the surprisingly fresh \u201cLowriders\u201d features such strong performances from a well-chosen cast, you may not mind. The script from Cheo Hodari Coker and Elgin James breathes life into these tried-and-true conceits with well-developed, complex characters. And de Montreuil, working with cinematographer Andres Sanchez, provides a vivid sense of place and a window into a part of the city we don\u2019t often seen on film. Advertisement Set within the mythical Mexican-American car culture of East L.A., \u201cLowriders\u201d is richly, culturally specific, yet its themes of regret and reconciliation, ambition and competition, love and loss are so universal, it\u2019s easy to imagine the film having well-deserved crossover appeal. And like the ethnically diverse juggernaut that is the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise, \u201cLowriders\u201d is all about #family. Demian Bichir is the Alvarez patriarch, Miguel, who runs a Boyle Heights auto body shop by day. But in his free time, he fixes up old cars, cruises the streets and competes with his lowrider crew of fellow old-timers, the Coasters. It\u2019s more than a way of life\u2014it\u2019s practically spiritual, and it\u2019s how Miguel met his wife, Gloria (a solid, convincingly de-glammed Eva Longoria), after the devastating death of his longtime spouse. Miguel\u2019s younger son, Danny (a handsome and likable Gabriel Chavarria), has his own form of expression as a graffiti artist, a pursuit dad doesn\u2019t think is worthwhile. Miguel also worries, understandably, about the dangerous and often illegal lengths to which Danny will go to share his art with the world. This is especially true because his older son, Francisco (a charismatic Theo Rossi), aka \u201cGhost,\u201d just got out of prison after several years for stealing car parts to build his own lowrider, which he drives with his own crew. Clearly, they\u2019ll all have to meet up at the big showdown at Elysian Park, the hilly section above downtown that\u2019s home to Dodger Stadium, for the annual lowrider competition. But in the meantime, we get a glimpse into the rhythms of these characters\u2019 lives. Danny\u2019s stepsister, Isabel (Montse Hernandez), worries about what dress she\u2019ll wear for her quincea\u00f1era. His best friend, Chuy (Tony Revolori of \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d), tags along and tries to fit in with Ghost and his tough, older friends. Advertisement Meanwhile, Danny starts dating a white street photographer (\u201cSupergirl\u201d Melissa Benoist), joining her for downtown\u2019s monthly art walk and trying awkwardly to blend in with her pretentious friends. In one the film\u2019s best scenes, she puts Danny in a socioeconomic box he doesn\u2019t want to be in while gushing over his work to a gallery owner; it stings, and when he chafes, we feel it. But the emotional heart of the film belongs to Bichir as a recovering alcoholic who\u2019s made plenty of mistakes and finally finds the guts to admit them. His performance aches with melancholy, but he also finds in this man an unmistakably sturdy sense of pride. Bichir\u2019s exchanges with the charming yet volatile Rossi give the film a steady sense of tension. \u201cLowriders\u201d may spell too much out with obvious dialogue, and it may veer a bit too easily toward melodrama. But there\u2019s an earnestness and a fundamental truth to this familial saga\u2014as well as an appealing, low-budget scrappiness\u2014that consistently make it hum."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "How He Fell in Love", "Review": "\u201cI don\u2019t need that,\u201d Ellen (Amy\r\nHargreaves) says, taking off her wedding ring during her first hotel tryst with\r\nprotagonist Travis (Matt McGorry). It\u2019s a disingenuous moment that encapsulates\r\nthe lack of emotional honesty that permeates \u201cHow He Fell in Love\u201d.  Directed and written by Marc Meyers, the\r\nstory follows Travis, an uninspired musician meandering through his early 30's in one of the most lifeless renditions of New York ever put to film.\r\nHe\u2019s still hung up on an ex-girlfriend/music partner whose wedding he sullenly\r\nattends in the opening scene. That is until he gets involved with the older,\r\nmarried yoga instructor, Ellen. Their affair, unsurprisingly, upends their\r\nlives and identities, forcing them to address major issues that being together\r\nbrings to the surface. For Travis, all his issues are brought upon by his\r\ninability to do much with his life despite the opportunities. For Ellen, there\r\nare more issues at hand, including her faltering marriage to Henry (Mark Blum),\r\nwho is 20 years older than her. Neither Travis nor Ellen seem to care all\r\nthat much about the weight of the decision they\u2019ve made and how it affects\r\nother people. They\u2019re bored with their lives, and this is just the easiest way\r\nto get the change they keep complaining that they need.  Advertisement If \u201cHow He Fell in Love\u201d had more energy\r\nand a bit more of a sense of humor it would almost come across as a parody of\r\nthe sort of aimless, minor key romantic dramas that come out year after year\r\nwith little in the way to differentiate them. Every choice made for the film,\r\nfrom the mostly white cast of characters to the framing and color palette is\r\noffensively generic, even if \u201cHow He Fell in Love\u201d is too forgettable to feel\r\nlike a misfire. The story doesn\u2019t provide the characters enough complications\r\nor personality, so it\u2019s hard to imagine it ever being great, even in the hands\r\nof a better director. Although, if the actors had more chemistry maybe it\r\nwouldn\u2019t be so middling.  This is the film's biggest issue.\r\nHow can you craft a love story when your leads have barely any chemistry? When\r\nthese two say \u201cI love you\u201d it comes across like words they\u2019re just trying on to\r\nhear how they sound, not because there is any deep connection between the two.\r\nEvery time they describe their romance as \u201cspectacular\u201d or \u201cindescribable\u201d it\r\nbecomes more and more laughable.  The acting starts off capable even if it\r\nreflects the same lifelessness of the film itself, but as the story continues\r\nthe performances only magnify script issues that become unbearable. It\u2019s as if\r\neven the actors don\u2019t believe the lines they\u2019re saying. An argument between\r\nEllen and Henry towards the end is the best example: She\u2019s become a shrill clich\u00e9, he pivots emotionally from calm resignation to\r\nfury that\u2019s hard to make sense of since he\u2019s so thinly written. Watching \u201cHow\r\nHe Fell in Love\u201d I was left wondering, who are these people? They have a\r\nsmattering of personality traits but not much in the way of a well-thought out\r\nemotional landscape.  Travis is an especially odd choice for a\r\nleading character. He\u2019s not conflicted or charming in the way the character\r\nneeds to be for this story to work, and McGorry is neither talented nor\r\ncharismatic enough to make the character come to life. His line readings often\r\ncome across as if he\u2019s not sure the character is trying to make a terrible joke\r\nor is actually being earnest. Ellen is a bit\r\nmore complicated, as her inability to have kids becomes a major component of\r\nher character, but she becomes more and more unlikeable as the film goes on. In\r\na different world, \u201cHow He Fell in Love\u201d could be a critique on the ways people\r\nchase the high that comes with new, illicit romance despite the obvious danger\r\nthat lies ahead, but the film is too timid to skewer its characters and make\r\nany bold choices. Advertisement There are a few interesting subplots that\r\nhad the potential to say something, anything about the human condition. Monica\r\n(Britne Oldford) is Travis\u2019 somewhat girlfriend who wants more from him than\r\nhe\u2019s willing to give. It sets up what could have been an exploration of the\r\nsort of prickly dynamics that come with modern dating thanks to technology and\r\nnebulously defined relationships, but Meyers drops that idea before it\u2019s\r\nallowed to gain any weight.  At the beginning, I wondered how\r\ndifferent the film would be if told from his perspective. Meyers is smart to\r\nnot make Henry cruel or cold. If anything he\u2019s a good husband who loves Ellen,\r\njust not in the way she wants him to, and Mark Blum infuses a sweetness in the\r\ncharacter that makes him easy to feel for. This makes the film\u2019s morality\r\ncomplicated in a good way. But again, Meyers doesn\u2019t examine this, instead\r\nchoosing to write Henry as downright nonsensical during the last act in a way\r\nthat contradicts how he\u2019s been previously used to create drama. Sure, this\r\nprovides twists but it doesn\u2019t feel honest.  What makes a good love story in the first\r\nplace? Chemistry is, of course, vital. The warmth and sexual tension between\r\ntwo actors can elevate a story from being mediocre to outstanding or ruin a\r\npotentially great one. A good love story doesn\u2019t need to be grand to impact the\r\naudience. There are many love stories with an arc from first kiss to heartbreak\r\nthat plays in a minor key, but they need chemistry and a point of view to feel\r\nlike they matter. Despite how much these characters go on and on about their\r\nlives and loves, the film itself has nothing to say."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Face of Love", "Review": "If Nancy Meyers ever decided to dabble in gothic romance, it probably would turn out to be something like \"The Face of Love\". The filmmaker, Hollywood's premier purveyor of onscreen d\u00e9cor porn who specializes in chronicling the humorous fantasy lives of the rich and heartbroken in such hits as \"Something's Gotta Give\" and \"It's Complicated\", would be right in her glossy wheelhouse amid the well-appointed domiciles on display in this Los Angeles-based outing.  She likely would also approve of the tasteful professions of the two central characters: A house stager hired by realtors to make empty abodes feel cozy and an adjunct art professor who paints large, sun-lit portraits. The casual-chic, over-50 garb worn by the leads would definitely pass muster, too.  Advertisement But style is easy. Substance is hard. Even Meyers might be stymied by what to do with the all-too-convenient twists and turns of this morbidly warped melodramatic story about a grief-stricken, middle-aged widow who decides to take a second chance on love with a man who is the spitting image of her late husband. Certainly, \"The Face of Love\"'s actual director Arie Posin, is hard-pressed to turn the repercussions of what is essentially a ghoulishly despicable act of deception into something that an audience would want to witness\u2014let alone feel sympathy about its clearly doomed outcome.  If they did, they could simply watch Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\" instead.  Granted, it isn't necessarily a bad thing to get a double helping of Ed Harris in one sitting. This enduring 63-year-old magnetic screen presence remains the sexiest bald actor of his generation\u2014and probably any other. And Annette Bening has lost none of her sensual allure at age 55, even as her Nikki morosely pines for Garrett, her adored spouse who recklessly drowned five years earlier while they celebrated their 30th anniversary at a Mexican resort. At first, we feel for Nikki, especially when she discovers Garrett's body as it washes up on the beach. Back home, she tries to rid all outward signs of his presence\u2014clothing, photos, artifacts, anything that would ignite memories of their passionate moments together. But the flashbacks keep coming. Her daughter is too wrapped up in her own relationship travails to support her mother as she struggles with her loss. Neighbor and needy widower Roger (a wasted Robin Williams) clearly would like to be closer to this lonely lady but he practically has \"Just a Friend\" stamped on his forehead. Advertisement Then, one day, she decides to go to the art museum by herself for the first time since Garrett's death. And who should be sitting outside on a bench but his very own doppelganger. And just like that, Nikki is no longer a woman in mourning. She is a woman obsessed. She proceeds to hunt down Tom\u2014as the divorced painter is called\u2014at the college where he teaches. Under the pretense that she wants to take art lessons, they meet and sparks fly. Roger, learning there is a new man in her life, asks Nikki: \"Is he younger, a boy toy?\" She responds, with a knowing smile: \"He's just my type.\" It's difficult to suppress the urge to scream \"Run, Tom, run!\" whenever a moony Nikki flutters her eyes while continually referring to him as Garrett\u2014that's on top of lying that she is alone because her husband dumped her. You would think he would get a clue that all is not right when they visit one of Garrett and Nikki's favorite restaurants together and the chef acts as if he already knows Tom. But, then, that would make sense.  If done right, \"The Face of Love\" could have been an interesting update of the sorts of \"women's films\" that Joan Crawford made in her later career. But Posin is more interested in summoning blatantly earnest emotions that are clearly beyond the reach of such pedestrian material. It all too easy to view Bening's character as a manipulative monster bent on destroying this innocent man for her own selfish purposes instead of someone who should be seeking psychiatric help. And what a shameful waste of a potentially dynamic movie couple, who really offer the only reason to sit through such a subpar soapy affair. If you must attend \"The Face of Love\" despite these warnings, just be prepared to leave with a look of disdain."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Neon Bull", "Review": "The latest example of what I call an emperor\u2019s-new-clothes\r\nfilm is \u201cNeon Bull,\u201d by Brazilian director Gabriel Mascaro, which escorts us into the world of\r\nnortheastern Brazil\u2019s vaquejada\r\nrodeos. It was a buzz-generating\r\nhit at last fall\u2019s Venice and Toronto festivals, and it does have one inarguable strength: a kind of\r\nanthropological interest, which is rendered with what one must assume is\r\ncertain quotient of documentary-like accuracy. Mascaro mostly avoids the fleeing excitements of the bull ring in order\r\nto focus on a small group of characters who function as kind of a de facto\r\nitinerant family. Iremar (Juliano Cazarr\u00e9) is a muscular and studly cowhand who\r\ndevotes his off time to designing clothes, including skimpy stage outfits for\r\nexotic dancer Galega (Maeve Jinkings), a Shakira lookalike who drives the\r\ncompany\u2019s truck and tends to her young daughter, Cac\u00e1 (Aline Santana). The\r\ngroup\u2019s other member is a corpulent cowhand named Z\u00e9 (Carlos Pessao). Advertisement Still, its success may owe in part\r\nto the kind of exaggerated responses that festival premieres often provoke. And\r\nI would venture there are a couple of other potential causes that stem from the\r\nparticular kind of festival film it\r\nis. First, it\u2019s the kind made outside of Europe and America but\r\ntailored for festivals in those places. Fans of international cinema who read\r\naccounts of premieres of a South American film at, say, Cannes may assume that\r\nsaid film was for made for the Brazilian market but happily discovered by\r\ndiscerning and venturesome French programmers. In reality, many of these films\r\nwere created specifically for programmers and juries at international\r\nfestivals, to whom they appeal by A) adapting the currently approved stylistic\r\nnorms for \u201cart\u201d films, and B) viewing their native cultures in ways that will\r\nbe seen as appealingly exotic by\r\nEuropeans and Americans. (Whether you love or loathe their films, even\r\nestimable filmmakers such as Taiwan\u2019s Hou Hsiao-hsien and Thailand\u2019s\r\nApichatpong Weerasethakul have become \u201cworld cinema\u201d auteurs by employing\r\nthis dual strategy.) Second, \u201cNeon Bull\u201d is the kind of film that also bows\r\nstrategically to other current cultural orthodoxies, specifically some rather\r\ndubious ones imported from academia. Consider the headline on The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s review of the\r\nfilm, which determines that its \u201cexploration of body and gender norms [makes]\r\nup for a lack of narrative.\u201d Translated into plain English, what that means is: The film\r\nis essentially boring because its story is minimal and un-involving. But\r\nbecause its concerns can related to \u2018body and gender norms,\u2019 which university\r\ncurricula now consider as important as previous centuries considered the Virgin\r\nBirth and Holy Trinity, it must be deemed important and meaningful.\n Yet does the film have anything really cogent to say about\r\nthose nominal subjects, or do the \u201cbody and gender\u201d labels disguise something\r\nmore pat and retrograde? Mascaro spends much of the film\u2019s length observing these\r\ncharacters as they sleep in hammocks and go about their daily routines. The\r\ncharacters are given no real depth\u2014they\u2019re types more than people\u2014and the\r\nnarrative has practically zero dramatic tension or development. There\u2019s a\r\ngeneral ambiance of sensuality which is upped a couple of notches when porky Z\u00e9\r\nis replaced by young, lean, long-haired Junior (Vinicius de Oliveira), and\r\nindeed the erotic intimations here are virtually the only things to sustain\r\nviewer attention. Advertisement Sex, almost by default, ends up being all the film has to\r\nsell. We get to see a horse being masturbated. And the climactic scene shows us Iremar\u2019s erection as\r\nhe mounts and has sex with a woman who\u2019s nine months pregnant. That\u2019s all? Well, yes. That\u2019s it. What does it say? That\r\nmiddle-class festival audiences in Europe and America derive a certain pleasure\r\nfrom watching sex scenes involving lower-class (and hence \u201cnaturally\u201d sensual\r\nif not essentially animalistic) foreigners, as long as such prurient\r\nattractions can be described as exploring \u201cbody and gender norms\u201d? No doubt.\r\nAnd the imperious cultural self-deception in that process would be laughable if\r\nit weren\u2019t so sympathetic."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Breathe", "Review": "\u201cBreathe,\u201d Andy Serkis\u2019 directorial debut, is an undeniably well-intentioned film. Serkis directs this true story of the parents of one of his best friends and producing partners, Jonathan Cavendish, and he does so with sensitivity and empathy. It\u2019s hard to even imagine making a film about your parents, much less if their story was this essential to the quality of life for disabled people. If you\u2019re thinking that making a story about someone that important to you might lead to the air of simplification that comes with hero worship, you\u2019re not wrong. Of course, Jonathan Cavendish and his best friend should place Robin and Diana Cavendish on pedestals as high as they can reach, but that approach doesn\u2019t really allow for three-dimensional filmmaking. The result is a film that sentimentalizes and softens what was clearly a very difficult situation, turning something that should be effective and honest into something that too often feels manipulative. The performances and the inherent power of the true story keep it from being a complete disaster, but one hopes Serkis moves on to more challenging material with his follow-up. Advertisement Serkis and writer William Nicholson get the courtship of Diana (Claire Foy) and Robin Cavendish (Andrew Garfield) out of the way pretty quickly. Before the credits have really ended, they\u2019re madly in love. They quickly marry and Diana gets pregnant with the baby who will become producer Jonathan Cavendish. Then tragedy strikes when Robin develops polio, told he will only live for a few more months, and that he has irreversible paralysis. At first, he can\u2019t even speak, able to only barely move his eyes. He\u2019s put on a respirator in a hospital, and basically told that\u2019s where he will die. He seems to come to terms with this, asking to be put out of his misery, but Diana convinces him to fight, even if just to get as much time as possible with his new son. As he begins that long fight, he takes the battle much further than anyone had before. When he and Diana are basically told that he\u2019ll live out his few remaining days in a hospital bed, they devise a way to take the equipment needed to keep him alive back to their house, despite the protestations of the head doctor. The Cavendishes then take that transportability a step further, figuring out a way to attach a respirator to a chair, and allowing Robin not only to get out of the house, but to travel. He becomes an advocate for the disabled, and someone who really pushed to change the way the medical industry looked at quality of life for people once presumed unable to have any. Obviously, that\u2019s a heartwarming story. And Garfield and Foy play the Cavendishes with a great deal of respect and admiration\u2014too much so, if I\u2019m being honest. \u201cBreathe\u201d never asks, much less answers, any of the really difficult questions about what the Cavendishes' lives must have been like. There\u2019s a brief moment early on in which Robin wants to die and another moment halfway through when he suggests Diana take a lover, but those kind of truthful moments of pain and confusion are too rare. This is a deeply sentimental version of a story that demanded more honesty and depth. And the final act feels purposefully manipulative, trying to pull the heartstrings in a way that the true story merits but the film hasn\u2019t really earned. The characters here are too flat and one can\u2019t shake the feeling that it\u2019s betraying the truth of their story to tell it with such a gauzy, TV movie sheen on top of it. Advertisement There is a metatextual element of \u201cBreathe\u201d that\u2019s almost more interesting than the movie when one thinks about who made it. Jonathan Cavendish became a producer, and films are often ways to transport people to places they wouldn\u2019t otherwise go and give voice to those who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have one. I\u2019d almost rather watch a documentary about Robin Cavendish in which the producer could draw that line between how his father transformed the world with his deep empathy for those often ignored to how his son now makes movies designed to change the world in their own way. Even Serkis, who may not first seem like the person you\u2019d expect to do this kind of prestige project, makes total sense if you think about how much he too wants to revolutionize his industry in a way that makes the impossible possible. I firmly believe that movie history books will be written about how much breakthrough work Serkis has done with films like \u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes\u201d and \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d And he\u2019s such a creative force that I could easily see him being a great director someday too. He just needs to take the kind of risks and seek the kind of breakthroughs he has in his motion-capture work, and try to do more than he\u2019s told he can, just like the father of one of his best friends.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Phata Poster Nikhla Hero", "Review": "\"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero\" (translation, roughly: \"the poster rips open and out comes the hero\") makes its intent clear early on. After a brief prologue, the movie's hero, Vishwas Rao (Shahid Kapoor), is introduced jumping through a poster of himself to dispense a few quips and beat up some guys menacing an innocent girl. This kind of self-reflexive comedy pervades throughout, with star cameos and many references to other movies and stars. The result feels like a not-quite-as-good equivalent for action-comedy of what Farah Khan's 2007 instant classic \"Om Shanti Om\" was to the romantic melodrama\u2014but to clarify, a movie can be not quite as good as something great and still be something very good. \"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero\" is very good. Advertisement In the lead role, Shahid Kapoor is charming, funny, a nimble dancer and action hero, and easy on the eyes. For a movie equally about actual heroism and the onscreen variety, it's essential that the lead be a legit movie star. Shahid Kapoor may have only had intermittent success thus far, but he's a joy to watch as Vishwas. His performance is perfectly calibrated, maintaining a level of silliness that makes an impression without wearing out its welcome over two-and-a-half hours. He's relentlessly likable, if that isn't too contradictory a phrase.  He isn't the only one, either. The movie's premise hinges on that most ancient of all comedy devices: mistaken identity. Vishwas has dreamed of being a movie star all his life, but his rigidly ethical mother (a delightful Padmini Kolhapure) insists that he become a police officer, and an honest one to boot. On a trip to Mumbai to secretly try to break into the movies, Vishwas finds himself mistaken for a policeman by the news media, the cops and the local criminal underworld. Hilarity predictably ensues.  It's nothing we haven't seen before\u2014which is the whole point\u2014and thus relies on its cast to bring life to the proceedings. They do not disappoint. Saurabh Shukla is hilarious as a gangster whose business is constantly disrupted by Vishwas's inadvertent crime-fighting frenzy (the ways in which he keeps stumbling onto and foiling crimes is itself very funny). Equally as good is Sanjay Mishra as a showbiz \"guru\" to impressionable young actors who ends up being both the cause and solution to a number of Vishwas's troubles. Ileana D'Cruz is quite good as the slightly unconventional heroine, Kajal. She and Vishwas fall in love because it's a movie and the male and female leads fall in love in a movie, but she isn't a helpless damsel waiting to be saved; in fact, her proactive nature drives the passive Vishwas for most of the movie.  Advertisement \"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero\" is about four-fifths terrifically entertaining comedy with a brief\u2014and, in retrospect, structurally necessary\u2014turn for the serious shortly after the interval. In fairly short order, writer-director Rajkumar Santoshi makes clear that what appears to be first a lull and then a severe tonal misjudgment is, in fact, part of the film's larger celebration of cinematic artifice. In this case, it's the ability of filmmakers to manipulate audiences to a desired end. A skilled filmmaker (and Santoshi, despite an occasionally iffy resume as a director, is that) can have the audience noticing, thinking, and feeling exactly what that filmmaker wants.  If that seems a slightly lofty sentiment in consideration of what is, for the most part, a very silly comedy, it bears remembering that comedy, of all genres, requires the most active manipulation on the part of the writer(s) and director. Comic set pieces have to be very carefully crafted, jokes built, running gags paced for maximum effectiveness. The choreography of all these elements, not just the dancing (which is creatively staged, and exuberantly performed, particularly by Shahid Kapoor), but also comic set pieces and story, make \"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero\" enjoyable on meta-cinematic terms but also for the good clean (and notably so) fun of its comedy. It's a rare film that's as fun to analyze as it is to sit back and enjoy. \"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero\" isn't quite that, as it's funnier than it is deep, but it's still an entertaining picture\u2014and one that, a couple of violent moments aside, is suitable for the entire family."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Long Strange Trip", "Review": "The thing about The Grateful Dead is, if you tell some stranger that there\u2019s a new four-hour documentary about the band, he or she is likely to respond, \u201cOf course there is.\u201d The legendary band is legendary in part for its devotion to duration. Long concerts, long jams on songs, a long time on the road. This documentary\u2019s title, \u201cLong Strange Trip\u201d comes from \u201cTruckin\u2019,\u201d a song from its 1970 album American Beauty. The band was only five years old at the time, although its ostensible leader, guitarist Jerry Garcia, had been gigging professionally since 1961. But the trip was going to get longer and stranger, grinding to a halt a quarter of a century after \u201cTruckin\u2019,\u201d with the 1995 death of Garcia.\u00a0 Advertisement   There have been challengingly long docs about classic rock bands in recent years. 2007\u2019s \u201cRunnin\u2019 Down A Dream,\u201d directed by Peter Bogdanovich, chronicled Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and justified its length by dint of Petty\u2019s talents as a raconteur. Alison Ellwood's not-quite-four-hour 2013 \u201cHistory of the Eagles\u201d could fly with the alternate title \u201cBlazing Egos.\u201d\u00a0   But of all the bands that might be considered for a gargantuan length film treatment, The Grateful Dead\u2019s scale of achievement and actual profound cultural influence make them arguably second only to The Beatles with respect to deserving such a treatment. And this movie, directed by Amir Bar-Lev, makes every minute count.   The movie is separated into six \u201cacts.\u201d In terms of how it looks and feels, it isn\u2019t too different from a lot of historical documentaries. There are many talking heads, and a lot of archival footage. Rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, once the fresh-faced baby of the group, is now ruggedly white-bearded and sits in the lotus position throughout his interview. For guys who didn\u2019t much like posing for photos, there\u2019s a lot of good imagery both still and moving. The sound mix of the music is superb. But the movie has virtues beyond mere ultra-competence. The six-act structure is more thematic than chronologically linear. This is not an \u201cand then X joined the band\u201d or an \u201cand then I wrote\u201d or an \u201cand then we made our difficult sophomore album\u201d kind of account. Percussionist Mickey Hart\u2019s several-year hiatus from the band (a parental intervention, if I recall correctly) doesn\u2019t come up. Tom Constanten, a keyboardist for the group in its earliest heyday, isn\u2019t mentioned or interviewed. What the viewer gets instead is a series of incredibly involving mini-movies, the first starring Barbara Meier, who was Jerry Garcia\u2019s girlfriend in the early \u201860s and came back into his life after a long absence in the early 1990s, most fatefully as it happens. Garcia himself is at his most eloquent in interview footage from late in his life, articulating how the improvisational approach the Dead brought to its music was informed by bluegrass more than jazz: \u201cBluegrass is a conversational music; the instruments talk to each other.\u201d Already an accomplished guitarist in the early \u201860s, he went a little nuts when he discovered the banjo, practicing obsessively.\u00a0 As the psychedelic \u201860s emerge and evolve, the use of LSD dissolves egos within the band initially called \u201cThe Warlocks,\u201d and inform the communal ethos that defines the Dead\u2019s early lifestyle and its music. The movie takes the intimations of the cosmic in the music seriously. Around the point Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernan, the bluesman who was often the odd man out in the Dead\u2019s furthest-out excursions, dies of cirrhosis of the liver in 1973, characteristically blunt former road manager Sam Cutler observes, \u201cAlcoholics don\u2019t like acid; they\u2019re trying to shut down the doors of perception, not open them.\u201d The band\u2019s opening of doors extended into aural realms, with their audio engineer (and legendary acid mixer) Owsley \u201cBear\u201d Stanley building a mind-blowing and increasingly impractical PA system called the \u201cwall of sound.\u201d You have to see it to believe it.\u00a0 Advertisement   These multivalent tales of the Dead are awe-inspiring and thought-provoking without fail. As is the section late in the movie, about the obsessive quests of Dead fans, one of whom includes U.S. Senator Al Franken. But what starts off inspiring becomes dispiriting. The Deadhead caravan morphs into a tentacled unruly monster. Garcia, ostensibly the group leader, is such an genuine philosophical anarchist he refuses to condemn anti-social fan behavior just as he refused to bar Hell\u2019s Angels from the backstage areas that often included whole families. (I was reminded of Vincent Cassel\u2019s Otto Gross in David Cronenberg and Christopher Hampton\u2019s 2011 \u201cA Dangerous Method,\u201d who shrugs \u201cFreedom is freedom\u201d when confronted with objections to his arguably damaging behavior.) And eventually Garcia falls victim to his own version of the Pagliacci joke: the engine behind a musical invention that brings joy to millions becomes depressed by the fact that he doesn\u2019t have his own Grateful Dead. Diabetes and heroin only make matters worse.\u00a0   As sad as Garcia\u2019s end is, \u201cLong Strange Trip\u201d remains an exhilarating and inspiring movie. For a not inconsiderable period, Garcia, Weir, Hart, Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann and various fellow travelers saw the possibilities that their talents and the times offered them, and made hay of them. I enjoy too many different kinds of music to become a true Deadhead\u2014comparing all those concert tapes looks like a lot of work!\u2014but I think the band was pretty great, and this wonderful movie has thrown me down a Dead rabbit hole that I\u2019m going to be happy to poke around in for quite a while."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "LUV", "Review": "This film tells such a sad story. You don't realize that at first. You think you know what's going to happen, and it will be conventional and comforting. We see an 11-year-old kid waking up in the morning, getting dressed, using his water pistol to aim at the mirror, and going in to breakfast with his grandmother and his uncle. It's a comfortable African-American home in Baltimore. His Uncle Vincent (Common), who drives a Benz, gives him a ride to school. There's a cute girl on the school steps who smiles at him in a flirty way. Woody (Michael Rainey Jr.) is a little shy and embarrassed. Vincent encourages him to smile back. Nothing doing. So he drives away from the school, just like that, and announces they're spending the day together. Advertisement This involves taking Woody to a neighborhood tailor, who fits him into a nice-looking suit and tie. Vincent tells him he has to present himself like a man. It was later in the movie that it occurred to me this visit wasn't simply a nice gesture. Was it part of a plan slowly in the uncle's mind, in which he might have a use for a well-dressed 11-year-old? Nuno Malo's music is serious and not terribly hopeful. Quiet, in the background, it broods as the man and the boy begin an odyssey around Baltimore. Facts randomly emerge. Vincent is fresh out of prison, having been given an early release. When the judicial system grants an early release, that doesn't always send a reassuring message to the prisoner's old friends. We learn that Vincent has plans to close a bank loan for his business project, a crab house on the waterfront. There are a lot of crabs in the movie, and even a little lesson about how to crack and eat one, because Woody has never eaten a crab before, and that will simply not do for a young man from Baltimore. So there's another lesson for the kid. The whole day and night will consist of Vincent and Woody driving around Baltimore and teaching and receiving lessons. At this point, Sheldon Candis' \"LUV\" still seems on safe ground. That's largely because of the presence of Common, the Chicago-born hip-hop artist. His character is focused on teaching Woody how to stand, speak, carry himself, look another person in the eye, and act like he's a considerable person. As Woody, the young actor Michael Rainey Jr. fits comfortably into his role, transforming himself from a squirmy, uncertain child into a young man who learns to do all of these things. That it does it in only about 24 hours is unlikely, but the film isn't concerned about being taken seriously on that level. It is about one generation learning from another. It grows darker and darker. When it ends, as I said, it is very sad. Spoilers ahead. What happens is that Vincent essentially puts Woody on the path to being himself. The child goes along on a visit to a bank, which reveals that Vincent's business plan is delusional. He meets Mr. Fish (Dennis Haysbert) and Arthur (Danny Glover), both relatives of some sort, and Cofield (Charles S. Dutton), an old partner in Vincent's criminal activities. These men laugh too much. They hug and smile, but we feel the ice in their veins. One or more betrayals are under way. Woody will be taught lessons of manhood, such as how to drive a car, how to shoot a gun, how to hide a stash, how to lie and bluff. The one thing he doesn't learn is how to smoke. People don't smoke nearly as much in the movies these days. It's a chilling fact that it would be more disturbing for us to see Woody with a cigarette in his mouth than with a gun in his hand. Advertisement It's a mentor-child relationship, with a mentor who is desperate and can teach the child only how to be as desperate as he is. It's Fagin and Oliver Twist, bleaker than Dickens could have imagined. I'll stop now. I won't reveal any more of the plot as the film descends into despair.  What was in Sheldon Candis' mind as he made \"LUV\"? Here is a film about African Americans that sidesteps all the usual, hopeful cliches and comments on how one failed generation raises another. This is how the gun and crime culture is passed along. This is how a nice kid in middle school has his life destroyed for him \u2014 unless he is very lucky and learns a lesson from these 24 hours in a nightmare."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Selfish Giant", "Review": "\"The Selfish Giant\" is easy to admire but difficult to recommend, because its vision of friendship, poverty and desperation is so stark. Written and directed by Clio Barnard, this film about adolescent boys who gather scrap to help their families is based on a fable by Oscar Wilde. But where Wilde's story summons warmly cathartic tears, the tears this film earns are colder and grimmer. Its outcome feels both unfair and inevitable. The film is set in West Yorkshire in Northern England, against a backdrop of cooling towers and buzzing transformers. There's no hint of a healthy economy. This slice of life seems populated mainly by scavengers and people who used to scavenge but gave up.\u00a0Its heroes are the smallish, blond\u00a0Arbor (Conner Chapman), who's hot-tempered and impulsive and seems to have a spectrum disorder, and the taller, kinder, dark-haired Swifty (Shaun Thomas), who often serves as Arbor's voice of reason. They're best friends, as close as brothers. Advertisement Arbor lives with his exhausted and short-fused single mom\u00a0(Rebecca Manley) and his\u00a0drug-addled, volatile older brother (Elliott Tittensor). \u00a0Swifty's house is as cramped and rundown as Arbor's; it's packed with seven siblings, plus an angry drunk dad (Steve Evets)\u00a0and a mom (Siobhan Finneran of \"Downton Abbey\") who has the haunted look of a prisoner who has accepted that she'll die behind bars. One of the first scenes set in Swifty's house ends with Swifty's dad dragging a fake-leather couch out of the living room and onto the lawn; he plans to sell it to pay the electric bill.\u00a0 Arbor and Swifty want to improve their lot. \u00a0They see a glimmer of hope in selling discarded appliances, cookware and wiring to scrapyards. They borrow a broken-down horse from a scrapyard owner to draw a cart around, but the scrapyard owner\u2014the innocuously named Kitten (Sean Gilder)\u2014charges them for the animal, and sometimes skims more at the end, because he can. \u00a0The boys soon realize there's more money in copper wiring than in dumpster and curbside garbage. They start collecting wire that was never meant to be collected, growing more brazen with each outing, as if daring fate to crush them.\u00a0 Kitten encourages Arbor and Swifty to take greater risks for bigger payouts. We're given to understand that this is typical behavior\u2014that scrapyard owners passively encourage minors to \"liberate\" other people's property because they can't be punished too harshly if the cops catch the kids thieving, or if somebody has an accident.\u00a0The boys' industriousness pays off in the short term: their eyes light up when they see wads of cash being pushed through pay windows. But in the long term, it's a sucker's game.\u00a0 Advertisement Barnard fills out this subculture with a journalist's eye. The light, the soot, the fog, the way sun hits the sides of buildings, the subtitled slang-riddled dialect, the posturing, the moments of ribald humor and casual bullying, the offhand exploitation of children and horses, all bespeak great powers of observation.\u00a0Barnard sometimes films the boys in long shot. They're flyspecks inching along cracked pavement and weed-strewn fields, industrial northlands looming behind them. Even when these images are used for rhythmic purposes\u2014to give the eye a chance to breathe between bouts of close-up camerawork\u2014they're never purely pictorial; they're putting the boys and their story in a larger context.\u00a0 A low-speed chase between rickety horse carts has a nerve-wracking physicality. In a time of CGI-driven filmmaking, even the most epic action has little dramatic or figurative weight. This is, no matter what safety precautions were taken, an actual event. \u00a0You worry about the horses and riders who are being followed by a carloads of drunken spectators and bettors, a soused peanut gallery on wheels.\u00a0 The filmmaker shows how the metal is collected and haggled over, and the personal and economic factors that affect scrappers' and buyers' survival.\u00a0The viewer may be reminded of the borderline-slave economies of the early 20th century American economy, before the unions settled in. Just as a 1920s miner was docked for his clothes, tools, room and meals, and came to feel as though he were working for the privilege of being allowed to live, the scrappers' game is rigged against them. In time, the junkyard horse seems analogous to the humans it serves: a beast of burden valued only for the weight it can bear. \"The Selfish Giant\" may remind you of other films about childhood under harsh circumstances, none of which, to put it mildly, were upbeat:\u00a0\"Killer of Sheep,\" \"Sounder,\" \"Los Olvidados,\" \"Panther Pachali\" and \"Kes.\" It's not on the level of those inspirations\u2014its doom-spiral story feels contrived in places\u2014but there's no denying its effectiveness. The film is a tragedy: keenly observed, warm, often funny, but a tragedy.\u00a0And yet even when the life-on-rails dramaturgy becomes wearisome, we feel we're watching an evil adult exploit angelic children. Arbor and Swifty aren't \"good\" or \"bad\" boys, just desperate and far too trusting. Kitten isn't a villain, just a mangled product of his environment like everyone else.\u00a0 Advertisement This is a social realist drama of the sort that another English filmmaker, Ken Loach, has been making for decades, but less didactic in how it reveals the political and economic dimensions of its characters' lives.\u00a0It's about how an extended village made up of local, regional and national governments fails two boys, their families and their communities. The school and social service employees who are supposed to monitor at-risk kids are so overworked, poorly trained or under-supported that all they can do is reflexively punish problem kids, or look away as they disrupt class and commit petty crimes. Kids and adults alike taunt each other for not being \"hard\" enough. We get the sense that all of these characters wouldn't be so tough, sometimes cruel, if the economy offered them a way to live in dignity and peace. At certain points, the relationship between Arbor and Swifty may remind you of John Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men,\" but in this version of the story, the little one is the unpredictable, emotionally limited outcast, and the big one is his guardian and minder, and they're both just boys who should be thinking of the future, not slaving away in the present. Their fate should not have been a foregone conclusion, and there's plenty of blame to go around. \"If\u00a0a fella steps on a round pebble and he falls down, breaks his neck, it ain't the pebble's fault,\" George says in the novel, \"but the guy wouldn't a done it if the pebble hadn't been there.\""}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Outrageous Sophie Tucker", "Review": "\u201cThe Outrageous Sophie Tucker\u201d is an outrageously dull documentary. This is not the subject\u2019s fault. In her six-decade career, Tucker never failed to be interesting and complex. Here was a woman whose career started out in vaudeville and lasted through the advent of rock and roll. Her powerful voice and brassy personality made her one of the biggest stars who ever lived, to the point where people named their kids Sophie in her honor. A decade after her death, Kander and Ebb name-checked her in \"Chicago.\" Her career influenced everyone from Mae West to Bette Midler, and she\u00a0was known to be as raunchy as they were, perhaps raunchier. Tucker befriended several U.S. presidents, some of whom dropped everything to take her calls. She was also the first person to pen and promote an autobiography, which she sold at her appearances. If you wanted to talk to Sophie, you had to buy her book. Advertisement These details only scratch the surface of Sophie Tucker\u2019s life. And yet, somehow, director William Gazecki made a film that lacks any of the fascinating nuances, details and complexities of a life this richly lived. \u201cThe Outrageous Sophie Tucker\u201d plays like a re-enactment of a Wikipedia page written by someone too terrified to delve below the surface of hagiography. The film has no visual style whatsoever, and the occasional use of a weird special effect that turns still pictures into marionette-like animations feels cheesy and cheap. Interview clips are thrown haphazardly at the screen with no point of reference as to when they had been recorded, and several of them feature someone rambling on for minutes on end in what looks like a prison interrogation room. For a talking-heads documentary to work, the interviewees must have interesting, informative and perhaps scandalous stories to tell about the subject at hand. A close-up of a person merely spouting information is not particularly of visual interest, so we must rely on the story they\u2019re telling to keep us engaged. \u201cThe Outrageous Sophie Tucker\u201d gives us celebrities such as Barbara Walters, Carol Channing and Tony Bennett, relatives of Tucker like her grand-niece and even the film\u2019s producers, Lloyd and Susan Ecker, who wrote their own book on Tucker. Outside of the Eckers, who occasionally\u00a0provide context based on their research of Tucker\u2019s own extensive journals, everyone spouts the usual things you\u2019ve already heard in countless documentaries like this. \u201cOh she was the greatest at this and the best at that!\u201d people mutter in generic clip after clip, never providing more than cursory details before being shuffled offscreen. Meanwhile, the filmmakers gloss over some of\u00a0the darker elements of Tucker\u2019s life and tiptoe around others. They\u2019re also rather stingy with doling out examples of Tucker in action, though the film\u2019s opening features a long clip from \u201cGay Love,\u201d a British movie she made in 1934. It\u2019s a great way to kick off the documentary, because it made me want to see and hear more of Tucker\u2019s work. Here was a woman who preceded Mae West in the salacious, double-entendre filled sex talking department, yet I don\u2019t recall seeing any comparative examples. At one point, Ecker says Tucker had a song whose lyrics are tame now, but were scandalous back then. I expected to hear this song, along with an explanation of its delicious nastiness, but no such scene followed the comments. Advertisement The details we do get about Tucker are intriguing enough to inspire frustration at the filmmakers\u2019 refusal to probe more deeply. Tucker was the original queen of self-marketing, advertising everything from beds to the exercise equipment she\u2019d never use. Proud of her thickness, Tucker preached the gospel of loving one\u2019s plus-sized self by singing a song with the gorgeous title \u201cNobody Loves a Fat Girl, But Oh How a Fat Girl Can Love!\u201d She had no problems getting men, despite the societal notion that only thin women were attractive. She considered herself \u201cthe last of the red-hot mamas,\u201d and her self-confidence would make Madonna seem shy. She started out in blackface, yet came to the defense of Josephine Baker decades later when Baker made her return to U.S. stages. Tucker had enough pull to scare the racist Southern audiences into behaving, telling them \u201cif she doesn\u2019t perform, I won\u2019t either.\u201d Additionally, we hear the bittersweet story about a WWII soldier fan of Tucker\u2019s whose goal is to play Sophie Tucker\u2019s most famous Yiddish song in the liberated streets of Nazi Germany. The way this is handled proves that the filmmakers had it in them to make a compelling documentary that pulled together both darkness and joy in its celebration of Sophie Tucker. After all, they had her autobiography and hundreds of her journals to work from here. Tucker documented everything, but while we get a sense of her achievements, we never get a true sense of her as a person. I wanted to know more about what she thought and how she felt about successfully traversing the \u201cman\u2019s world\u201d of show business. This is a standard doc about a woman who was anything but standard. The one plus of \u201cThe Outrageous Sophie Tucker\u201d is that it made me want to read Tucker\u2019s autobiography, \u201cSome of These Days.\u201d Something tells me it will be far less timid, and far more outrageous, than this movie."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Commune", "Review": "\"That's the point of a commune. You support each other.\" Said by one character at a moment of crisis in Thomas Vinterberg's \"The Commune,\" it expresses the ideal of living in community. If a group of people decide to forswear the typical nuclear-family structure, if they decide to pool their resources and go through life as a group, then\u2014ideally\u2014there should be more\u00a0support present for each individual in said group. If someone falls, multiple people will be there to help pick him back up. But that's not how it works out, human nature being what it is. People are selfish, people screw up, people keep secrets, etc. It's a rich dramatic topic, in and of itself. However, \"The Commune,\" featuring a great ensemble cast (many Vinterberg regulars), doesn't really focus all that much on what happens when you put a bunch of charismatic individuals into one house. The ensemble is just background noise for the main story, a married couple in a midlife crisis. Pretty bourgeois, considering the \"free love\" '70s atmosphere. Maybe that's the point. Advertisement When Erik (Ulrich Thomsen), a professor of architecture, inherits his gigantic childhood home, he assumes he'll have to put it on the market right away. He and his wife Anna (Trine Dyrholm) have only one daughter, 14-year-old Freja (Martha Sofie Wallstr\u00f8m Hansen), and the house is far too big for just three people. Anna, a television news anchor, suggests that they invite some friends to live with them. Share the costs, of course, but also to liven up their humdrum lives a bit. Anna is open about her own boredom in her relationship with Erik: \"I need to hear someone else speak. Otherwise I'll go mad.\" The plan gathers steam. One friend signs up, then another. Eventually, the group gels together. They hold formal interviews for new members. They go skinny-dipping together to celebrate their new life, and walk across the street en masse, holding up traffic like rock stars. There are two children who live in the suburban commune, the aforementioned Freja, and one couple brings their son, a small solemn child with a heart condition. Vinterberg grew up in such a community. It seems like it would be great to be a child in such an environment, surrounded by adults who are not your relatives, people coming and going, leaving you to your own devices. Vinterberg focuses a lot on Freja, her wary watchful face. She's only 14. She lives in a house with 10 adults, most of whom are drunk the majority of the time. Hansen is a wonderful actress, a beautifully strong presence. In \"The Commune,\" life is first one, long, drunken party. The group cooks together, cleans together, eats together. They touch base nightly, keeping a running chart on how everyone is doing. (This situation would be an exhausting nightmare for introverts.) Being truthful and open is required. Anything hidden will fester and cause problems. When Erik starts an affair with a young student named Emma (Helene Reingaard Neumann), he opens up to Anna about it. She is stunned and hurt, but instead of asking him to move out, suggests that he have Emma move in with the group. What could go wrong? Advertisement Dyrholm, a superb actress, manages to show\u2014in her behavior, in her glitchy little pauses for thought and reflection\u2014why Anna would make such a suggestion. Anna is so determined to create the kind of life for herself that she wants, a free life, a life where people can live and let live, and so how does one achieve that when one's heart is breaking, when one's marriage is falling apart? If she threw Erik out, wouldn't that be just a petty reversion to conformism? Isn't the goal to stop being attached\u00a0to things, including people? Vinterberg's harrowing 1999 film \"The Celebration\" showed his gift for ensemble drama. Having to put up a \"front\" for the group makes things exponentially worse. This is what happens in \"The Commune,\" and it's brilliantly acted (in particular by Dyrholm). But once the marital crackup takes center stage, the movie loses most of its charge. There are some interesting observations throughout about the human need for dominance, control, order, even in an unconventional environment. No matter how free we are, how liberated, we still feel the need to set up chore charts. Even so-called hippies gravitate towards bureaucracy. Freedom requires organization. The group votes on every decision. Someone says at one point, \"Okay, let's vote on whether to vote.\" Ironically, there's a pull towards conformity. Individualism cannot go up against the group. This is how cults are formed. The commune here does not become a cult, but when Erik suddenly pulls rank, shouting at everyone, \"This is MY house,\" it's a perfect representation of the challenge. You're supposed to give up on the idea of ownership, on the idea of individualism itself. These are all fascinating concepts, but \"The Commune\" isn't all that interested in exploring them."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Criminal", "Review": "\u201cCriminal\u201d is the kind of dunderheaded enterprise that leaves viewers reeling from the idiocies they have just endured, wondering how something like that could possibly get made in the first place. Although I have absolutely no proof that any of this is true, I do have a wild speculation regarding how it come into existence. My theory is that 25 years ago, during a break towards the end of production on Oliver Stone\u2019s controversial epic \u201cJFK,\u201d co-stars Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones got together to remark about what a calm and easygoing set it was and how they should all get together again someday. Eventually a pact was formed\u2014a quarter century from then, they would have a reunion that would involve one of two things. If all three of them had won an Oscar by that time they would spend a relaxing week or so hanging out and reminiscing about old times. However, if even one of them was still Oscar-free by then, they would instead pledge to find the dumbest and sorriest excuse for an action movie available and waste their time and talents on it instead. I admit, this may not be the most plausible scenario imaginable\u2014especially the part about Oldman still not having an Oscar\u2014but it makes a hell of a lot more sense than this film and is frankly more entertaining to boot, which should give you some indication as to how rotten it really is. Advertisement \n As the film opens, hunky London-based CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) has just stashed away Dutch hacker Jan \"The Dutchman\" Stroop (Michael Pitt), as part of an agreement to get him $10 million and a new identity, in exchange for a wormhole program that could cause untold death and destruction in the wrong hands. Pope is ambushed by the minions of Hagbardaka Heimbahl (Jordi Molla), a crazed Spanish businessman-turned-anarchist who has already vowed to bring bloody revolution to the world. Pope is killed, but for bureau chief Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman), that is not an insurmountable problem. After keeping his neurons firing artificially, Wells calls in Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones), a brilliant neurosurgeon who has luckily been developing a procedure to transfer memories from one brain to another. As it turns out, the only person that Dr. Franks is willing to do the procedure on is Jericho Stewart (Kevin\u00a0Costner), an imprisoned sociopath whose childhood injury to the frontal lobes left him incapable of feeling any kind of emotion or empathy but happily left him the perfect lab rat for the experiment. \n When Jericho fails to recall the crucial information about the whereabouts of The Dutchman\u2014who by now is making moves to sell his program to the Russians\u2014a mere ten seconds after waking up from experimental brain surgery, Wells orders him killed. But after he manages a violent escape and makes it back to London, he then begins demonstrating odd flashes of Pope\u2019s skill set and memories that range from the usual spy stuff to being able to speak French to that time he rented \u201cDouble Jeopardy.\u201d More significantly, the operation seems to be allowing him to feel emotions for the first time\u2014when he breaks into the Pope house and seems prepared to do horrible things to his widow (Gal Gadot) and their adorable daughter (Lara Decaro), he only robs them instead of murdering them in their beds. Informed by Dr. Franks that he will only be able to tap into Pope\u2019s memories and emotions for another three days or so (sadly, Dr. Franks doesn't get a chance to say \u201cWell Jericho, we always knew this day would come), Jericho decides to try to figure out where The Dutchman is and protect Pope\u2019s wife and kid, while at the same time eluding both the CIA and Heimbahl\u2019s army of largely moronic minions. \n At this point, many of you are probably thinking that \u201cCriminal\u201d sounds like the most absurd film concept imaginable\u2014a lunatic blend of \u201cFlowers for Algernon,\u201d \u201cSeconds\u201d and any of the various movies involving Ryan Reynolds and experimental procedures that allow him to once again contact a significant other while hordes of trained killers try to wipe him out. The film is ridiculous but personally, I have no problem with goofball action extravaganzas as long as they are presented with the right amount of style and wit. Take the oeuvre of Luc Besson, for example. Films like \u201cNikita,\u201d \u201cLeon\u201d and \u201cLucy\u201d have utterly absurd premises but he relishes those absurdities, presenting them in such a cheerfully nutty manner while at the same time deploying his astonishing skill for staging action set pieces that you can\u2019t help but be entertained by them\u2014they may be eye candy but they are definitely of the gourmet variety.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Although \u201cCriminal\u201d borrows any number of pages from the Besson playbook, ranging from the European locales to the main actors to the dialogue that occasionally sounds like it went through the Babelfish translator one time too many, director Ariel Vromen (whose previous works have included the indie efforts \u201cDanika\u201d and \u201cThe Iceman\u201d) never manages to find the right handle for the material. His staging of the action beats, though bloodier than perhaps expected, is perfunctory at best and only rarely reaches those heights. Dramatic moments also fail largely because we are never at any time invested in Jericho\u2019s transformation nor his reunion with his family. He also fails to make any lucid sense of the screenplay by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg\u2014if you can explain why Heimbahl wants to destroy the world or why The Dutchman is suddenly eager to sell to the Russians and offer a potentially disastrous demonstration of his abilities to boot, you are one up on me, or you have had the memories of Cook and/or Weisberg jammed in your skulls. \n As previously noted, \u201cCriminal\u201d has an unusually strong cast for a film that might have otherwise gone the VOD route, but even they don't help. Despite his eternal nice guy image, Costner has done an excellent job playing psychopaths in the past in such films as \u201cA Perfect World\u201d and the criminally underrated \u201cMr. Brooks,\u201d but this ranks as one of his worst performances to date. In lieu of creating a convincing character, he spends the entire film talking in a grunt that suggests a mediocre Nick Nolte impression. For their parts, Oldman and Jones respond to their thinly delineated characters in their usual ways\u2014the former chews as much of the scenery as he can without causing massive structural damage while the latter is so stiff and undemonstrative that he seems to be doing every single scene under duress. As Bill's wife, Gal Gadot is striking enough but has even less to do here than she did in that \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d boondoggle. Despite what the ads suggest, Ryan Reynolds is only in it for a few minutes and spends part of that time getting tortured at length with an electric cattle prod. \n And yet, with the combination of big stars and plenty of explosions, I am sure there are probably some people thinking that I am just being too fussy over a simple \u201cpopcorn film\u201d (an expression that I loathe), one that exists only to provide mindless entertainment and nothing else. How can I possibly convince them that they would be better served choosing the likes of \u201cEverybody Wants Some!!,\u201d \u201cMidnight Special\u201d or \u201cGreen Room\u201d? While checking out the trivia section for \u201cCriminal,\u201d I came upon this simple but astonishing fact: \u201cNicolas Cage turned down a lead role.\u201d Considering the films that the weirdly indiscriminate Cage is perfectly willing to sign on to do, the fact that this was somehow beneath him should pretty much say it all. \u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "America the Beautiful 2: The Thin Commandments", "Review": "Oh, did I know how that felt. I eventually lost a good chunk of 100 pounds through the Pritikin program, but that meant starting over again several times, because all these diets have a catch: You actually have to work them. I'm no expert, but I will share a winning formula: regular exercise and a diet heavy on whole foods, especially vegetables, fruits and grains. And cut down on the fat. And way down on the salt. Not a lot of meat. I'm now in the unique situation of never again having to worry about my weight, because after my medical adventures, I can't eat, drink, taste or smell. I get all of my nutrition out of a can via g-tube, supplemented by fresh juices. You know the theory that some people just \"naturally\" put on weight? It's recommended that I have six cans of liquid nutrition a day. At that level, I gain weight. Go figure. Advertisement What does this have to do with Darryl Roberts and his film? Not very much, but I like talking about my food and diets, and Roberts likes talking about his. At one point in the film, he looks quite a bit slimmer, but he makes no big claims. Roberts is a tall man with a reliable tummy. He is friendly, confiding and very likable, and I think he would make a good talk show host, the kind people would confide in. Here he talks to a beautiful dancer who never thinks she's thin enough, authorities who insist on rigid obedience to their theories and Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius, who has a Rick Perry Moment when she's stuck for an answer to this excellent question: Does our emphasis on BMI numbers in childhood lead to eating disorders in maturity? Roberts thinks so. BMI, or body mass index, is your body weight divided by the square of your height. Who came up with that? A Belgian named Adolphe Quetelet, between 1830 and 1850. How meaningful is it? Not very, if among those who have \"bad\" BMIs are Tom Cruise, George W. Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime. Yet schools measure it and inform parents, and some kids get traumatized. Schools might more profitably emphasize realistic exercise programs; not expensive challenging sports but, you know, stuff like walking. The only exercise program that ever consistently worked for me was the 10,000 steps a day program. This film is a sequel to Roberts' original \"America the Beautiful,\" which largely centered on a beautiful young model who endangered her life with bulimia. The second film is all over the map, lacking much of a focus and without a concrete list of recommendations. Still, it contains a great deal of information and is much more entertaining than a film about weight loss has any right to be. And here's another thing: Darryl Roberts has an infectious charm. He may not get much of anywhere specific, but it's a pleasure going along on his journey. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Layover", "Review": "\"The Layover\" is a slapstick comedy about two women who have the hots for the same guy. Alternately sentimental and raunchy, it wants to be another \"Bridesmaids,\" but settles for being one of those not-entirely-terrible movies that you leave on the TV because you're too tired to get up and find the remote so that you can change the channel.  Alexandra D'Addario plays Kate, a nicey-nice schoolteacher whose job is in jeopardy (probably because she's not very good at it). Kate Upton plays Meg, her best friend, aka The Wilder One; the first time we meet her, she's trying to sell imported North Korean cosmetics, and as the film goes on, she consistently acts as the troublemaker, though Kate catches up soon enough.  Advertisement The women decide to escape their troubles by taking a holiday vacation to the tropics, but when their plane is diverted to St. Louis, Missouri following a hurricane advisory, they become enamored with a dude who sat between them on the flight. His name is Ryan (Matt Barr). He's got long blond hair and a neatly trimmed beard, killer abs and a superhero chest, and his voice sounds a little bit like George Clooney's. Virtually the instant Ryan enters Kate and Meg's orbit, his very presence drives them into a spiral of brain-dead, sometimes vicious one-upsmanship.  Their nonstop competition for a beefcake prize continues until a third-act plot twist sends the story in a different direction. Of course by the end the friends must realize that their bond is more important than any man. In the meantime, we get treated to an array of slapstick setpieces, including an impromptu diving competition at a hotel pool that features the movie's only genuinely terrific visual punchline, and a scene involving The Filthiest Toilet in Missouri that ends up being merely disgusting. Molly Shannon, Rob Corddry, and Kal Penn are wasted in small roles. Penn's is borderline insulting: after anchoring three \"Harold and Kumar\" films, he's stuck playing a hotel manager who's confined to a couple of scenes. The script doesn't even have the courtesy to give him something interesting to do. I could have played his role, and I'm a terrible actor. The lead actresses are game for anything and knockout-gorgeous, in ways that stretch credulity sometimes\u2014the diving scene puts D'Addario in a bathing suit that could've been on the cover of Sports Illustrated, confirming that she's one of those schoolteachers who eats nothing but fish and rice and spends two hours a day at the gym. Barr is eye candy as well, though his part is underwritten at first and contrived near the end of the story. There are too many moments when you might catch yourself imagining the same material with ace comic performers in the roles (Kristen Wiig and Anna Faris, for instance). Upton in particular seems a case of settling for the actor you can get instead of casting the actor you need. She isn't explosively incorrect enough to provide the incandescent spark this character requires. Meg and Kate's relationship is a \"reasonable one/dangerous one\" pairing. The dangerous one needs to seem truly dangerous here, a creature of pure narcissism and hunger, though with a core of sweetness that explains why Kate puts up with her. Upton's Meg merely comes across as tediously self-absorbed and oblivious\u2014the kind of woman you'd immediately diagnose as a pill if you met her at a party, then avoid for the rest of the night.  Advertisement Matt Jones (\"NCIS,\" \"Found\"), who plays a hotel guest who gets pulled into Meg, Kate and Ryan's melodrama, is the only actor who seems to have a life apart from the lame situations he's required to enact. He's the heart and conscience of the film. That and a buck fifty will get you a cup of coffee. In fairness, David Hornsby and Lance Krall's screenplay and William H. Macy's direction (yes, really\u2014that William H. Macy) don't do the actors any favors. The lead characters don't have enough psychological meat to convince us that they'd toss a lifelong friendship in the garbage just because a great-looking guy came into the picture. Except for maybe a half-dozen shots, Macy treats the camera as a recording device, even though the writing and acting are rarely notable enough to be worth preserving. There are intriguing throwaway lines here and there\u2014\"Not this time,\" Kate says to Meg in a hotel hallway, suggesting that her friend has stolen guys from her in the past\u2014but these aren't developed in a way that might amplify the slapstick and give the mandatory reconciliation-with-lessons-learned moment feel improbably moving, as it should be in a film of this type. (The third act makes hash of the competition anyway, which is irritating.)  Maybe the heart of the problem is that Kate and Meg's behavior doesn't track with the practical realities of lifelong, functioning friendship between (most) women as experienced by...well, any functioning adult who lives in the world. This story would be more convincing with the genders flipped: two male nerds impulsively damage a lifelong bond after a pretty woman sits between them on a plane and, for one shining moment, makes them feel desirable, too."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets", "Review": "Every summer movie season needs at least one out-of-left-field entry that is so cheerfully bonkers it stands as a living rebuke to an industry that churns out noisy and soulless garbage like \u201cTransformers: The Last Knight.\u201d This year, that film is \u201cValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,\u201d a deliriously entertaining film that finds writer/director Luc Besson swinging for the fences in his efforts to make a weirdo sci-fi epic for the ages and coming up with a virtual home run derby. It's a film filled with humor, charm, excitement and so many memorable images that many viewers will find themselves struggling to keep from blinking so as not to miss any of the eye-popping delights crammed into each overstuffed frame.  Advertisement The film is inspired by Valerian and Laureline, a French comic book series created by Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mezieres that is said, especially among European comic book buffs, to have influenced the look of any number of films over the years, including \u201cStar Wars.\u201d The comics also helped to instill an interest in the genre in a ten-year-old Besson, who would eventually go on to employ Mezieres to help design the look of his own elaborate sci-fi epic, \u201cThe Fifth Element.\u201d Besson may be one of the leading players on the international moviemaking scene, but while watching \u201cValerian,\u201d he has reverted, in the best possible way, to the mindset of a kid helplessly enthralled by the wild plotting, bizarre alien worlds and breathless derring-do on display\u2014albeit a kid who has been able to marshal together armies of cutting-edge visual technicians and a near-$200 million budget (the largest in French film history) to bring it all to life exactly as it played in his head.  Set in the 28th century, the film centers on Valerian (Dane DeHaan) and Laureline (Cara Delevingne), a pair of special operatives fighting crime throughout the universe. As the story begins, the two are sent off to Big Market, a virtual-reality bazaar whose hordes of vendors can only be seen and approached after donning special equipment, to confiscate an ultra-rare and powerful M\u00fcl Converter, an adorable creature capable of reproducing anything that it eats. The cocky Valerian soon finds himself being pursued by any number of creatures while the far more cool and collected Laureline is charged with saving his bacon, presumably not for the first time.\u00a0 The twist this time is that, due to a technological malfunction, Valerian is also trapped between two different levels of reality with most of his body in the real world while his arm is stuck in the virtual universe. This may not make a lot of sense in the explanation but the end result on the screen is a hilarious and exciting thing of crackpot beauty that is just one high point of a film filled with them. After securing the M\u00fcl Converter, Valerian and Laureline report to Alpha, a massive floating city that began centuries earlier as the International Space Station and has expanded over the years to serve as a home away from home for aliens from throughout the universe to live together in harmony. Now Alpha\u2019s very existence is being threatened from within, and Valerian and Laureline are charged with getting to the bottom of things before it is too late. The two uncover evidence of a massive government conspiracy to cover up a ghastly mistake. As they try to unravel the scheme before all is lost, the two are separated and have a series of adventures involving a wild collection of creatures, the most memorable of which is a shape-shifting \u201cglampod\u201d played by pop princess Rihanna, who turns up to help Valerian rescue Laureline.\u00a0 Advertisement Besson has long been one of the most stylish filmmakers, but he outdoes himself here. There is not a scene in the film that does not contain a visual worth savoring, whether it is an unusual creature, an extravagant costume or just a throwaway oddity lurking in a corner. (This is one of the rare recent films in which the 3-D option is clearly the way to go.)\u00a0At the same time, though, Besson is using his visual skills as a way of telling the story instead of merely serving up bits of gourmet eye candy. Take the extended early sequence set on a bucolic distant planet whose sleek and iridescent inhabitants go about their business before being interrupted by a cataclysmic event. The scene is an initial grabber because of the absolutely gorgeous design of the planet and its inhabitants. But as it goes on, we quickly get a sense of who they are in relation to each other and how their world functions without a single word of dialogue to explain any of it. Some will complain that the screenplay is little more than a series of action sequences linked together by a story that doesn\u2019t make any sense and absurdly clunky dialogue. While some of the criticisms are valid\u2014there are times when the dialogue sounds as if it underwent one pass too many through translation software programmed by George Lucas\u2014Besson\u2019s narrative is more ambitious than usual this time around and, for all the silliness on display, ultimately touches on real-world concerns such as political corruption and the international refugee crisis in ways that lend real emotional weight to the proceedings. At the same time, \u201cValerian\u201d is unusually optimistic in its depiction of the future from the charming prologue showing the evolution of Alpha to the sight of its inhabitants living together in peace. At a time when virtually every futuristic film envisions some form of dystopian nightmare, the sunnier take shown here is refreshing. The only weak element to \u201cValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,\u201d ironically enough, is Valerian himself. Throughout his career, Besson has never shown much interest in telling stories based around conventionally masculine heroes. Most of his films have centered on tough and resourceful female characters, and when guys have been front-and-center, Besson has subverted their macho natures in some way (such as dressing Bruce Willis in Jean-Paul Gaultier in \u201cThe Fifth Element\u201d). Here, Valerian should be brave, bold and resourceful, but as inhabited by DeHaan, he comes across more like a callow kid struggling to emulate the effortless cool of Han Solo. Besson is clearly more interested in the character of Laureline, and viewers will be, too, thanks to Delevingne's performance. She is funny, convincing in the fight scenes, charismatic as hell, and capable of taking an absurdly melodramatic speech like her climactic oratory on the importance of love and making it work. Thanks to films like \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and the recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d entries, we are in a new age of exemplary female heroes at the multiplex, and Laureline is fully deserving of a place among them. Advertisement \u201cValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\u201d is an utter delight and one of the most gorgeous fantasies to hit the screen in recent memory\u2014the kind of film that can take moviegoers logy from the usual array of craptaculars and render them giddy with its pure fun. The question, of course, is whether viewers will be willing to give its weirdo charms a chance. But if you want to come away from a film feeling dazzled instead of simply dazed, this is an absolute must. Besides, it is almost certainly going to become a cult favorite in a few years, so why not get in on the ground floor while you can?"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian", "Review": "The\u00a0\"Chronicles of Narnia\" movies take place in several worlds simultaneously. The magical fantasy land of the title is grounded in ancient Greco-Roman mythology, ruled by sorcery and superstition, and populated by centaurs, minotaurs, fauns, gryphons, talking mammals, tree spirits and such. The Pevensie kids are homo sapiens children of WW II England, though they spend most of their screen-time (and alternate lives) in Narnia, where they are royalty.  C.S. Lewis wrote the novels in the post-war United Kingdom, between 1949 and 1954. And the pictures themselves are the products of a globalized 21st-century economy dominated by multinational conglomerates like the Walt Disney Company. All of these influences can be felt in the first two \"Narnia\" films, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" (2005) and the latest, \"Prince Caspian\" (2008). Advertisement With bigger battles and scarier monsters than its predecessor, the new movie flaunts grander visual effects, and, with one notable exception, a dash more individuality than the initial installment. Thanks are due to supporting appearances by a diminutive Narnian named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage, whose eyes have to do all the work underneath those flowing whiskers and latex wrinkles) and a fearless feather-sporting mouse named Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard with flair, and without overacting).  The keepers of the franchise should also be delighted that the actors playing the Pevensie children have aged so gracefully over the last three years, or 1,300, depending on how you're counting. You never know when somebody's going to go through an awkward stage, but these kids have only grown more photogenic with time. As for the other visual effects: While most of the CGI in \"Wardrobe\" was passable, some dialog scenes with the children displayed what looked like surprisingly sloppy green-screen work, especially for such a mega-production. (Hasty re-shoots, perhaps?) This time, the great lion Aslan (voiced deeply but rather blandly by Liam Neeson) is still too much of a cuddly plush toy from the vanished kingdom of F.A.O. Schwartz, but some of the other sights are thrilling, notably a floody encounter with Poseidon/Neptune, and some mobile trees that could make Birnam Wood come to Dunsinane in a jiffy. These are no doubt highly sophisticated technical and artistic achievements, but they retain some of the simplicity and charm of Ray Harryhausen's pioneering stop-motion creations. If you've read the novels (I haven't), you already know that your favorite characters from the first movie, like Mr. Tumnus the Faun and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, will not be returning. \"Prince Caspian\" takes place centuries after the vanquishing of the titular witch in part one. As part two begins, the persecuted Narnian diaspora has been driven deep into the woods, and allegedly to the brink of extinction, by usurper Telmarine King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto). It is never quite clear, though, who exactly the Narnians are. They're definitely not a species or a race because they include leopards, badgers, dwarves (they're called \"dwarves\" in the credits, not \"little people\"), giants, rhinoceroses, unicorns and mice (many of whom are conversant in English) -- but not, as you may recall from the first film, tigers, wolves, cyclopses, miniature Huns or two-legged yaks, all of whom are unaccountably but virulently anti-Narnian.  Advertisement Now it's Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes, with his indefinable Mediterranean accent -- more Spanish than Italian) who must return from exile to claim the throne, and although he's a Son of Adam (human), he's not a Narnian, he's a Telmarine. And we don't really know what that is, either. Unfortunately -- since he figures prominently in the next two installments as well -- Caspian registers as little more than a pretty vacancy in his debut outing. The time spent on his story, and the political backstabbing at the dark and dreary royal court, involving bearded lords and generals who all run together in a swarthy stew, feels like expositional padding, and there's too much of it in this nearly two-and-a-half-hour movie. When the film initially plunges us into the Caspian story (the prince's daring escape from his uncle's castle on the night Miraz's wife delivers him a male heir), its strategy is unclear: Are we being introduced to a new character because we're supposed to care, or are the filmmakers just toying with us, delaying the gratification of seeing the Pevensie siblings? All of the above, probably. In wartime London, the formerly cranky and petulant Edmund (Skandar Keynes) has become a trusty backer of his testy older brother Peter (William Moseley), who resents being a regular teen again after having already lived to adulthood as golden-boy High King of Narnia. Susan (Anna Popplewell) is learning to fend off nerdy smitten schoolboys, and Lucy (Georgie Henley) has developed poise and grace to complement her natural curiosity. It will be up to them to help Caspian defeat Miraz and restore the monarchy. As directed by Son of Adam Andrew Adamson (the \"Shrek\" series), the \"Narnia\" movies are mostly about the plot and the effects, not necessarily in that order. They are serviceable spectacles, but don't approach the mythic grandeur and resonance of more grown-up films like John Boorman's \"Excalibur\" or Guillermo del Toro's \"Pan's Labyrinth.\" And in part that's because character is not destiny in the \"Narnia\" pictures. Destiny is. Which creates some moral and dramatic dilemmas for the viewer. With all the dramatis personae Lewis has crammed into his filagreed fantasies, few of the players have the opportunity to leave much of an impression, or acquire significance, beyond what the tale demands of them. (Who's that badger again?) They do what is asked of them -- in the story and by the story. And once we realize that even the leads are predestined to play their parts in fulfilling prophecies, and that all they have to do to meet the requirements is to abide by (or guess) whatever certain mystical authority figures want them to do, the tension deflates a bit. Advertisement The moral options, as set forth in the movies so far, are fairly clear-cut: believe the beautiful lion and the friendly beavers; don't trust the sepulchral ice queen bearing Turkish Delight or the hideous dark demons extolling the forces of hate. What could be simpler? A child could do it. And what kind of lesson does that communicate to the child who can? That it's easy to tell right from wrong? Not a wise maxim. What responsibilities do the Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve (how does that work?) bear for their own decisions, and the consequences of their actions, if everything can eventually be set right by some deus ex machina -- the healing properties of supernatural potions, or the corrective powers of magic lion's breath? What becomes of free will, of meaning itself?  \"Prince Caspian\" represents a slight moral advancement over its predecessor in that hubris does have catastrophic consequences -- though mostly for extras and bad guys. Hundreds die needlessly because their reputed leaders put too much stock in their own invincible status, but the price paid is never too dear, at least not for anybody you become accustomed to seeing onscreen.  The larger question remains: Why, really, do the Narnians need some anti-democratic, monarchy-loving European Son of Adam to lead them, to protect them, to fulfill their prophecies? (Think of Dennis the repressed anarcho-syndicalist peasant in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\": \"You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you!\") Why can't the Narnians just lead themselves?  There's an obvious candidate for the job here -- a towering black centaur named Glenstorm (Cornell S. John), possessed of a noble bearing unsurpassed in Narnia. (He doesn't move as gracefully as he ought, but that fault lies with the effects crew and not with the character.) Now this charismatic fellow is a natural leader, a prophet, and a mesmerizing public speaker to boot. When he talks, you listen. He could also kick the pudding out of Peter or Caspian with both arms behind his back (and still have four legs to stand on!). Sadly for him (and us), his fate was decided a long time ago... by an Irish writer who dwelt in England's green and pleasant land. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Run All Night", "Review": "Ditching the twisting high concepts of works like \u201cUnknown\u201d\r\n(amnesia!) and \u201cNon-Stop\u201d (one flight!), action star Liam Neeson and director Jaume\r\nCollet-Serra have crafted their most satisfying work to date by sticking to a\r\ntried-and-true crime movie template, and allowing a talented cast and tight\r\nproduction values to be the only high concept they need. \u201cRun All Night\u201d isn\u2019t\r\nperfect, but it\u2019s surprisingly satisfying on its own terms, elevated by a\r\nbetter-than-average ensemble and some razor-sharp editing to cut through any\r\nnagging questions about the plot. More than he\u2019s been allowed to do in either\r\nCollet-Serra vehicle before this one, Neeson gets to portray a real character\r\nhere, a man who may have once had a particular set of skills but has seen then\r\ndulled by age, regret and whiskey. \u201cRun All Night\u201d is proof that quality action\r\nfilms don\u2019t really need to reinvent the wheel each time out as long as they\r\nmake it spin this smoothly. Advertisement Jimmy Conlon (Neeson) used to be a notorious mob enforcer.\r\nIf he knocked on your door, you knew you were in trouble. Rumored to be behind\r\nover a dozen murders at the behest of the infamous Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris),\r\nConlon doesn\u2019t have much left to live for. He\u2019s the guy who wakes up in the bar\r\nthe next morning and just starts drinking again, forced to beg Shawn\u2019s son\r\nDanny (Boyd Holbrook) for money and drunkenly play Santa Claus at the Maguire\r\nChristmas party. The man who once was feared is now openly mocked by a younger,\r\ntougher generation of bad guys. Jimmy also lost all touch with his son Mike\r\n(Joel Kinnaman), who is trying to live a straight life as a limo driver with\r\nhis wife (Genesis Rodriguez) and two kids (with a third on the way).  The first act of \u201cRun All Night\u201d is really the arc of two\r\nsons\u2014one trying to get away from the criminal underworld and one diving as\r\ndeeply as possible into it. As Danny, the very talented Boyd Holbrook is all twitchy, nervous energy, the kind of dangerous sociopath who seems\r\ncapable of doing whatever it takes to gain the respect of his father through\r\ncriminal notoriety. To that end, he brings heroin into their world. Dad says\r\nno, but Albanian heroin dealers don\u2019t like to be pushed out of a possible\r\ncriminal enterprise. It just so happens that the dealers hire Mike to drive\r\nthem to a meeting with Danny that goes horribly awry. Before you know it, Danny\r\nis dead, and Mike is a target of everybody in the criminal underworld, including\r\na high-priced assassin played with effective cool by Common, and only his estranged\r\ndad can keep him safe till morning. Neeson does arguably the best work of his action career here\r\nin that he captures a man who doesn\u2019t just pop to life as a killing machine\r\nagain but has the muscle memory to get the job done one last time. Jimmy may\r\nstumble through subway tunnels but he can still choke a man out and fire a\r\nperfect shot when he needs to. And the actor rises above the potential clich\u00e9 of\r\nthe criminal redemption arc in the way he doesn\u2019t allow the potential melodrama\r\nto sink into his portrayal. His take on Jimmy is a man doing what needs to be\r\ndone, not necessarily to right the wrongs of the past but because there\u2019s\r\nnothing else he can do at this point. And watching Neeson and Harris in scenes\r\ntogether, especially a great, tense meeting in the middle of the piece, is a\r\nsurprising joy. They\u2019re both great here in that neither overplays the hero or\r\nvillain archetype. Jimmy, the good guy, is a murderer, while Shawn, the bad guy, is emotionally mourning the loss of his child. They are far more complex than they would have been in the hands of other\r\nactors. Advertisement \u201cRun All Night\u201d is also subtly elevated by a top-notch team\r\nbehind the camera, especially editor Craig McKay, a two-time Oscar nominee for \u201cReds\u201d\r\nand \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d For at least an hour, \u201cRun All Night\u201d hums\u2014to be fair, there\u2019s\r\na bit of a sag in the middle and the entire piece runs too long at nearly two\r\nhours. But take note of the way McKay and Collet-Serra orchestrate a great sequence\r\nin a subway station, creating a rhythm between the cops trying to find Mike and\r\nthe bad guys coming after Jimmy. Or look at the great car chase scene, which is\r\nshot in a bit too much close-up (as are a few of the fights), but has a\r\nvisceral pace to it that makes it impossible to look away. Or watch one of the final sequences in a train yard and the way it perfectly fits together to build tension. There\u2019s a tempo to \u201cRun\r\nAll Night\u201d that really serves as the entertaining foundation of the whole film,\r\nand it\u2019s what so many boring action films lack. Some of \u201cRun All Night\u201d doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and I\r\nwished for a little more grit and a little less polish in some of its darker\r\nbeats (although viewers should be warned that this piece doesn\u2019t shy away from\r\nextreme violence at times). There\u2019s also a fine line between entertainment and\r\nbeing a bit too on-the-nose when you choose to set a shoot-out in an Irish bar\r\nto The Pogues, but the film had won me over by that point. And that\u2019s when you\r\nreally know an action film has worked overall\u2014when its flaws are beaten down\r\nlike the guys who choose to cross Jimmy Conlon by what works."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Beowulf", "Review": "In the name of the mighty Odin, what this movie needs is an audience that knows how to laugh. Laugh, I tell you, laugh! Has the spirit of irony been lost in the land? By all the gods, if it were not for this blasted infirmity that the Fates have dealt me, you would have heard from me such thunderous roars as to shake the very Navy Pier itself down to its pillars in the clay. To be sure, when I saw \"Beowulf\" in 3-D at the giant-screen IMAX theater, there were eruptions of snickers here and there, but for the most part, the audience sat and watched the movie, not cheering, booing, hooting, recoiling, erupting or doing anything else unmannerly. You expect complete silence and rapt attention when a nude Angelina Jolie emerges from the waters of an underground lagoon. But am I the only one who suspects that the intention of director Robert Zemeckis and writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary was satirical? Advertisement Truth in criticism: I am not sure Angelina Jolie was nude. Oh, her character was nude, all right, except for the shimmering gold plating that obscured certain crucial areas, but was she Angelina Jolie? Zemeckis, who directed the wonderful \"The Polar Express,\" has employed a much more realistic version of the same animation technology in \"Beowulf.\" We are not looking at flesh-and-blood actors but special effects that look uncannily convincing, even though I am reasonably certain that Angelina Jolie does not have spike-heeled feet. That's right: feet, not shoes. The movie uses the English epic poem, circa 700 A.D., as its starting point, and resembles the original in that it uses a lot of the same names. It takes us to the Danish kingdom of King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins), where the king and his court have gathered to inaugurate a new mead hall, built for the purpose of drinking gallons of mead. The old hall was destroyed by the monster Grendel, whose wretched life consists of being the ugliest creature on earth, and destroying mead halls. To this court comes the heroic Geatsman named Beowulf (Ray Winstone), who in the manner of a Gilbert & Sullivan hero is forever making boasts about himself. He is the very model of a medieval monster slaughterer. (A Geatsman comes from an area of today's Sweden named Gotaland, which translates, Wikipedia helpfully explains, as \"land of the Geats.\") When the king offers his comely queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) as a prize if Beowulf slays Grendel, the hero immediately strips naked, because if Grendel wears no clothes, then he won't, either. This leads to a great deal of well-timed Austinpowerism, which translates (Wikipedia does not explain) as \"putting things in the foreground to keep us from seeing the family jewels.\" Grendel arrives on schedule to tear down the mead hall, and there is a mighty battle which is rendered in gory and gruesome detail, right down to cleaved skulls and severed limbs. \tNow when I say, for example, that Sir Anthony plays Hrothgar, or John Malkovich plays Beowulf's rival Unferth, you are to understand that they supply voices and the physical performances for animated characters who look more or less like they do. (Crispin Glover, however, does not look a thing like Grendel, and if you are familiar with the great British character actor Ray Winstone you will suspect he doesn't have six-pack abs.) Variety reports that Paramount has entered \"Beowulf\" in the Academy's best animated film category, which means nothing is really there, realistic as it may occasionally appear. I saw the movie in IMAX 3-D, as I said, and like all 3-D movies it spends a lot of time throwing things at the audience: Spears, blood, arms, legs, bodies, tables, heads, mead, and so forth. The movie is also showing in non-IMAX 3-D, and in the usual 2-D. Not bad for a one-dimensional story. Advertisement \tBut I'm not complaining. I'm serious when I say the movie is funny. Some of the dialog sounds like Monty Python. No, most of the dialog does. \"I didn't hear him coming,\" a wench tells a warrior. \"You'll hear me,\" he promises. Grendel is ugly beyond all meaning. His battles are violent beyond all possibility. His mother (Jolie) is like a beauty queen in centerfold heaven. Her own final confrontation with Beowulf beggars description. To say the movie is over the top assumes you can see the top from here. Now about the PG-13 rating. How can a movie be rated PG-13 when it has female nudity? I'll tell you how. Because Angelina Jolie is not really there. And because there are no four-letter words. Even Jolie has said she's surprised by the rating; the British gave it a 12A certificate, which means you can be a year younger and see it over there. But no, Jolie won't be taking her children, she told the BBC: \"It's remarkable it has the rating it has. It's quite an extraordinary film, and some of it shocked me.\" \tHere's the exact wording from the MPAA's Code people: \"Classified PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence including disturbing images, some sexual material and nudity).\" How does that compare with a PG rating? Here's the MPAA's wording on \"Bee Movie\": \"Classified PG (for mild suggestive humor and a brief depiction of smoking).\" I have news for them. If I were 13, Angelina Jolie would be plenty nude enough for me in this movie, animated or not. If I were 12 and British, who knows?"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Babies", "Review": "\"Babies\u201d is the perfect film for anyone who has never had the opportunity to interact with humans at an early age. You may never have had one, held one or baby-sat one, yet remained curious about the infants you see in a park, on the beach, or in baby carriers at the mall. Now a French documentarian has traveled to Africa, Asia and America to bring back charming footage of babies in their natural habitats. If, however, you've raised children and/or grandchildren, or had little brothers and sisters, the movie may resemble 79 minutes of unpaid baby-sitting. When Baby Mari starts screaming, you're wishing you could turn on the TV and use something bright and noisy as a distraction. But no, you're at a movie. However, maybe \u201cBabies\u201d may be fascinating viewing for babies, just as many dogs and cats have their favorite programs. At last, here's programming for the Mommy & Me screenings. Advertisement The babies are cute. Well, all babies are cute. That's just as well, because how could filmmakers audition a baby and wait six months to give it a callback? It's not a baby anymore. The director, Thomas Balmes, has found exemplary babies in Namibia, Mongolia, Tokyo and San Francisco, and observes them lovingly as they nurse, play, doze, poke kittens and happily hit one another. The movie is really about the babies, not their parents, and in most cases, we only see those parts of the parents ranking highest on the infant's interest scale: nipples, hands, arms, and male and female chests. Not all of the nipples are real, but the babies don't discriminate as long as they work. Two of the babies come from poor parts of the world, and two from rich. They seem equally happy and healthy. The Japanese and American babies are subjected to an awesome array of baby training strategies so they can begin climbing the success ladder as early as possible. I have no argument against baby yoga classes, but I have never known a baby who wasn't naturally able naturally to contort itself into alarming positions and get lost in meditation on the spur of the moment. The African baby, Ponijao, lives in a forest hut with an earth floor, but this is Home and here is Mother and there are sticks to play with that may not be made of plastic and ornamented with Disney creatures but are excellent sticks nonetheless, and satisfying. Bayarjargal (nicknamed Bayar), whose family lives in a yurt in Mongolia, passes time by becoming expert in sibling rivalry.  Mari, from Japan, and Hattie, from America, are surrounded by a baffling array of devices to entertain them, serve them, shelter them, protect them and help them grow up big and strong. Can the epidemic of attention deficit disorder be explained by the First World's lack of opportunities for babies to be bored? How can babies concentrate when things are forever being jingled and dangled at them? Is there too much incoming? I dunno. What I do know is that babies are miraculous. From a sprawling, bawling start, they learn to walk, talk, plan, scheme, play and figure stuff out. Generations of scientists have hurled themselves at the question of exactly how babies learn to talk. They must be getting so frustrated by the fact that the babies just go ahead and do it with no training. Advertisement Did I like the movie? Aw, yeah, I did. How could I not? Did I feel I needed to see it? Not really. I appreciated the fact that there was no narrator to explain what I was seeing; no voiceovers like \u201clittle Bayarjargal learns early to appreciate the mystery of yogurt.\u201d No parents asking, \u201cAre you a good little boy?\u201d and answering, \u201cYes, he's good little boy.\u201d Just babies. Wonderful.  I was once in that state myself. I remember being flat on my stomach with my eyes an inch away from ants all crawling in a line on the front sidewalk. I've never been so entertained in my life."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Lions for Lambs", "Review": "Useful new things to be said about the debacle in Iraq are in very short supply. I'm not sure that's what \"Lions for Lambs\" intends to demonstrate, but it does, exhaustingly. Essentially, if I have this right, we should never have invaded Iraq, but now that we're there, (1) we can't very well leave, and (2) we can't very well stay, so (3) the answer is, stay while in the process of leaving. The movie is a talkathon with a certain amount of military action. It could be presented about as well as a radio play. Directed by Robert Redford, it uses an all-star cast which focuses attention away from the dialogue and toward the performances. Since I doubt that's what Redford intended, it doesn't speak well for the screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan. When a third of a movie involves a verbal duel between Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep, what are we supposed to do, not notice who's talking? Advertisement The movie follows three storylines, plus flashbacks linking all of them. In Washington, a veteran journalist (Streep) sits down for an exclusive interview with a Republican senator (Cruise) who has presidential ambitions. In Los Angeles, a political science professor (Redford) sits down to discuss the purposes of life with a brilliant but disappointing student (Andrew Garfield). And in Afghanistan, two of the professor's former pupils (Michael Pena and Derek Luke) are involved in a firefight on a snowy mountain peak. As it happens, they are involved in the very military strategy that the senator is touting to the journalist. It involves seizing the high ground in Afghanistan earlier in the season than the Taliban can get there, to control mountain passes and therefore prevent Taliban troop movements. The Cruise character presents this as a strategic breakthrough on a level with, I dunno, Nelson's rout of Napoleon. In Los Angeles, the promising student has just stopped caring, and the talk with his professor is designed to reignite his passion. He should get involved in his nation's politics -- take an interest, take a stand. A flashback sequence shows the two soldiers winning a classroom debate by calling the other side's bluff: They have enlisted in the military. The movie is anti-Bush's war, I guess. The journalist makes better points than the senator, anyway. What the professor and his student think is hard to say, although they are very articulate in muddying the waters. As for the two enlistees, it is safe to assume that at the end of the film, they are wondering whether their debate strategy was the right one. There is a long stretch toward the beginning of the film when we're interested, under the delusion that it's going somewhere. When we begin to suspect it's going in circles, our interest flags, and at the end, while rousing music plays, I would have preferred the Peggy Lee version of \"Is That All There Is?\" Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Lady", "Review": "It was impossible to watch the biopic \"The Lady\" without thinking of \"They Call It Myanmar: Lifting the Curtain,\" a new documentary I saw a few weeks ago. Both are set in the once-enchanted land of Burma, which, like its neighbor India, was governed by British colonialism, and also like India suddenly received its independence in a disorderly fashion. In India, that led to the troublesome partition of Pakistan. In Burma, it led to democratic elections whose outcome was overthrown by assassination. As it was said at the time, \"The British stayed too long and left too quickly.\" Advertisement The central figure in both films is the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, whose father, Aung San, was elected to head the country and then assassinated, leaving the nation to a long period of repressive dictatorship under a military junta. The daughter, always called Suu Kyi, fled after her father's death to England, where at Oxford, she married the professor Michael Aris, had two children, and settled down as a housewife. Burma during those years disappeared behind a curtain of secrecy and paranoia. Many Burmese remained in exile, because being \"Westernized\" might mean their imprisonment upon return. Only the illness of her mother drew Suu Kyi back to Burma, for a personal visit that the uneasy generals were told was non-political. Once there, however, she was swept up in protests by the National League for Democracy and implored by students to join their cause. She agreed to address a gathering. It was not publicized, but the news passed from ear to ear and a huge crowd overwhelmed police efforts to contain it. Her fate was clear: She was destined to be a leader of the struggle. She was then kept under house arrest for most of the next 15 years, even while winning the Nobel, and allowed to see her husband and children only a few times before he died of cancer back home in Oxford. This was a strong and stubborn woman \u2014 perhaps too stubborn, she once confessed to Michael \u2014 but it required an iron will to play her role. Only in recent weeks have open elections been permitted; her movement swept into power, and Suu Kyi is now a member of Parliament. This story is told in \"The Lady,\" directed by the prolific French director Luc Besson, who has great success in making action, sci-fi and martial-arts movies (\"The Fifth Element,\" \"Subway,\" \"The Professional\"). For \"The Lady,\" he has enormous resources at his command, including impressive crowd scenes staged in Thailand. The other film I mentioned, \"They Call It Myanmar,\" is in some ways an amateur film, however skillful and polished. It was shot secretly with a consumer HD camera by Robert H. Lieberman, a professor at Cornell, who covers a great deal of Burmese history and crucially has interviews with Suu Kyi herself. In person, she seems much the same as the character played by Michelle Yeoh in \"The Lady\": composed, calm, resolute, with a firm British accent.  Advertisement \"The Lady\" is more professional but, for me, \"They Call It Myanmar\" is more useful. Lieberman answers questions that Besson does not think to ask. The Besson film, written by Rebecca Frayn, does indeed deal with a real life, but follows so faithfully the traditional shape of film biography that it feels less convincing. One of its distractions is the emphasis on Suu Kyi's marriage. There are too many domestic conversations, too many shots of Michael (David Thewlis) at home looking concerned while watching the news on TV. He is in Burma at the time of her first speech at the rally, and the film covers this momentous event mostly with reaction shots of his face in the huge crowd: proud, concerned, smiling, apprehensive, relieved. This is not a criticism of David Thewlis' performance. He usually plays querulous or alarming characters, and this time, he's a tousle-headed bookworm, kind to the core, who places his wife's politics above everything else. He was a good man. But this should not be his story or the story of their marriage. In a sense, he should be offscreen, as he was during her house arrest.  Yeoh is also strong in the film, embodying the qualities that Suu Kyi seems to possess. Yeoh was the original force behind this film. What was needed was a different point of entry for the screenplay, so that it isn't such a conventional biopic. Besson's busy career has centered on writing (44 credits) and producing (103). He usually matches talent to each project and has directed only 17 times. Perhaps, given his strengths in genre films, he should have chosen not to direct this one, and instead selected a director like Mira Nair or Deepa Mehta."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Ida", "Review": "Debuted earlier this year at Lincoln Center and now on a national tour, the 21-film series \"Masterpieces of Polish Cinema\" bears stunning testament to the brilliance of not only one especially fecund national cinema but an entire era of moviemaking\u2014call it the golden age of the art film. As Martin Scorsese, who curated the series and whose Film Foundation provided its pristine digital restorations, has remarked, the period it covers (roughly the \u201850s through the \u201870s) was one of extraordinary accomplishments in many parts of the cinematic world, a high-water mark that grows ever more dazzling in retrospect. Advertisement Set in the Poland of 1962 and composed of austerely gorgeous black and white images, Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s \"Ida\" could fit right into the \"Masterpieces\" series, evoking as it does films ranging from Andrzej Wajda\u2019s \"Innocent Sorcerers\" to Jerzy Kawalerowicz\u2019s \"Mother Joan of the Angels\" (both 1960). But that\u2019s not to suggest it\u2019s a throwback or an exercise in cinematic nostalgia. Riveting, original and breathtakingly accomplished on every level, \"Ida\" would be a masterpiece in any era, in any country. Somewhat ironically, director and co-writer Pawlikowski can\u2019t be considered a Polish filmmaker in any strict sense. Though born in Poland, he grew up in Great Britain and has done most of his work there (his previous films include \"My Summer of Love\" and \"Last Resort\"). \"Ida\" represents a return home for the filmmaker, one that he has said draws on the memories, sights and sounds of his childhood. That retrospective, and somewhat impressionistic, viewpoint mirrors the film\u2019s own. Though set in the '60s, the era of Communist rule and modernization, the story scripted by Pawlikowski and Rebecca Lenkiewicz looks backward in time. Given that it starts out in a convent that seems like it hasn\u2019t changed since the Middle Ages, you might say that the film\u2019s perspective suggests a vast expanse of Polish history. But its main focus is closer to hand: the country\u2019s occupation by the Nazis (a historical passage that is resonantly evoked but never seen or directly referred to). Anna (Agata Trzebokowska) is an 18-year-old orphan who was raised in that convent and is preparing to take her vows when her Mother Superior insists that first she meet her one known relative. That is an aunt, Wanda (Agneta Kulesza), a former prosecutor with a high Communist Party rank whose dissolute life of smoking, drinking and bedding men stands in stark contrast to the ascetic existence of her sheltered niece. But Anna has more to be shocked about when Wanda tells her that her real name is Ida (pronounced Eeda), that she is Jewish and that her parents were killed during World War II. Advertisement This revelation triggers a journey in which aunt and niece drive back to the village of Anna\u2019s parents in an effort to discover how they died and where they were buried. Although this quest is central to the narrative, \"Ida\" is anything but plot-driven. It\u2019s a film of moments, observations and moods, with a lyrical unfolding that recalls such atmospheric monochrome road movies as Wim Wenders\u2019 \"Kings of the Road.\" And when the two voyagers pick up a hitchhiking tenor saxophonist (Dawid Ogrodnik) and end up watching his gigs, the music of John Coltrane and similar artists adds an engrossing aural dimension to the odyssey. Few recent films can claim a visual approach as striking as that which cinematographers Lukasz Zal and Ryszard Lenczewski give \"Ida.\" Filmed in the unusual, boxy aspect ratio of 1.37:1, and most often deployed in static long shots, the film\u2019s images sometimes suggest Vermeer lighting with the color taken away, and the compositions manage to seem at once classical and off-handed, with the subjects often located in the screen\u2019s two bottom quadrants. As in Bresson, the effect is to draw the viewer\u2019s eye into the beauty of the image while simultaneously maintaining a contemplative distance from the drama. Pawlikoski and Lenkiewicz\u2019s scripting proves similarly lapidarian. Besides its look, \"Ida\" most recalls the manner of bygone art films in the modernist spareness and thoroughgoing obliqueness of its writing. Very little is stated directly; instead, we glean things from casual remarks and subtle suggestions. Somehow, this technique of inference makes the film\u2019s eventual revelations feel both more integral and more powerful. Because revelations do come, despite the quest\u2019s languorous rhythms, and they touch on arguably the darkest and most troubling chapter in modern Poland\u2019s history. What happened to Anna\u2019s parents? Most films that approach this horrific arena envision jackbooted armies and vast industrial execution sites. But in Poland in the '40s, as in Cambodia in the '70s and Rwanda in the '90s, evil\u2019s authors could be one\u2019s friends and neighbors, and simple farm implements its instruments. In touching on this reality, \"Ida\" adds something to a subject that sometimes seems to have lost the ability to disturb us as it should in movies. Advertisement Besides this historical acuity, the film gives us a fascinating pair of matched archetypes in its main characters, which are realized in two exquisite performances. As the aspiring nun who\u2019s suddenly tossed into the ugliness of the world, newcomer Agata Trzebokowska proves a poised icon of luminous quietude and awakened curiosity, discovering herself as she painfully uncovers her past. And as the embittered, nihilistic \u201cRed Wanda,\u201d a woman driven both by the horrors inflicted on her and those she\u2019s inflicted on others, veteran Polish actress Agneta Kulesza creates the astonishing impression that some of history\u2019s most wrenching conflicts are being played out in a single human soul. Like much about \"Ida,\" these actresses\u2019 work not only pays homage to masterpieces of the past but revivifies current cinema in doing so."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Jane Eyre", "Review": "Gothic romance attracts us with a deep tidal force. Part of its appeal is the sense of ungovernable eroticism squirming to escape from just beneath the surface. Its chaste heroines and dark brooding heroes prowl the gloomy shadows of crepuscular castles, and doomy secrets stir in the corners. Charlotte's Bronte's Jane Eyre is among the greatest of gothic novels, a page turner of such startling power, it leaves its pale latter-day imitators like Twilight flopping for air like a stranded fish. To be sure, the dark hero of the story, Rochester, is not a vampire, but that's only a technicality. The tension in the genre is often generated by a virginal girl's attraction to a dangerous man. The more pitiful and helpless the heroine the better, but she must also be proud and virtuous, brave and idealistic. Her attraction to the ominous hero must be based on pity, not fear; he must deserve her idealism. Advertisement This atmospheric new \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d the latest of many adaptations, understands those qualities, and also the very architecture and landscape that embody the gothic notion. The film opens with Jane Eyre fearfully fleeing across the bleak moors, where even nature conspires against her. This is not the opening we expect, with Jane already fully grown, but later in flashbacks, we'll be reminded of her Dickensian girlhood, her cruel aunt, her sadistic boarding school, and her need as a girl without means to earn her own way as a governess. Jane is described in the novel as a plain girl; is that where the phrase \u201cplain Jane\u201d comes from? Here she's played by Mia Wasikowska (of Tim Burton's \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d), who is far from plain but transforms herself into a pale, severe creature who needs to be watered with love. She is employed by the intimidating Rochester (Michael Fassbender) to supervise the care of his \u201cward,\u201d Adele Varens (Romy Settbon Moore), who is being raised in his isolated manor, Thornfield. How he came into the possession of a young girl as his \u201cward\u201d is an excellent question, one among many that could probably be answered by Thornfield's dedicated housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax (Judi Dench). The classic \u201cJane Eyre\u201d is the 1944 version with Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles. Fontaine was 27, Welles was 29. Mia Wasikowska is 21 and Michael Fassbender is 34. In the novel, Jane is scarily 20 and Rochester is \u2026 older. Whether in any version he is old enough to accomplish what he has done in life is a good question, but this film is correct in making their age difference obvious; Jane in every sense must be intimidated by her fierce employer. No version I know of has ever made Rochester as unattractive as he is described in the book. Advertisement Rochester is absent a good deal of the time, although represented by the foreboding atmosphere of Thornhill, the enigmatic loyalty of Mrs. Fairfax, and the sense that something is amiss in the enormous manor. Here Judi Dench's contribution is significant; the tone of her voice conveys so much more about Rochester than her words. Either you know the plot or not. Its secret is a red herring with all the significance of \u201cRosebud.\u201d It functions only to provide Rochester with an honorable reason to propose a dishonorable thing, and thus preserve the moral standards of the time. The novel is actually about forbidden sexual attraction on both sides, and its interest is in the tension of Jane and Rochester as they desire sex but deny themselves. Much of the power comes from repressed emotions, and perhaps Charlotte Bronte was writing in code about the feelings nice women of her time were not supposed to feel. The director here is Cary Fukunaga, whose \u201cSin Nombre\u201d was one of the best films of 2009. Its story, based on fearsome Mexican gangs, scarcely resembles \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d but it showed an emotional intensity between characters who live mostly locked within themselves. He's a director with a sure visual sense, here expressed in voluptuous visuals and ambitious art direction. Michael Fassbender is an Irish actor who can have a threatening charm; did you see him in \u201cFish Tank\u201d (2010), a quite different film about a seductive man who takes advantage of a teenage girl? Mia Wasikowska, from Australia, is a relative newcomer who must essentially carry \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d and succeeds with restraint, expressing a strong moral compass. Judi Dench is firm, as a housekeeper must be firm, and observes everything, as a housekeeper must. All of the rest is decoration. Without the costumes, sets, locations, sound design and the wind and rain, gothic romance cannot exist."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Motel Life", "Review": "Joan Didion famously wrote, \"We tell ourselves stories in order to live.\" And that's what brothers Frank (Emile Hirsch) and Jerry Lee (Stephen Dorff) Flannigan do for one another in \"The Motel Life\", directed by producers/directors/brothers, Gabe and Alan Polsky. Frank tells the stories, and Jerry Lee does accompanying drawings in a sketch book. They tape the drawings all over the cinder block walls of the various dingy motels they call home. Frank and Jerry Lee are grown men, but damaged and on the run, living in the permanent American underclass, and the stories are the lifeline they have created for one another, the context in which they operate as brothers. Jerry Lee pleads with Frank, \"Tell me a story, Frank?\" Based on the debut novel by musician Willy Vlautin, \"The Motel Life\" could have been a schmaltzy mess in less sensitive hands. It could have made kitschy and quirky that which is essentially poignant and heartfelt. But the directors and the cast, through a miracle of tone, mood, and emotion, have made a film that feels true, that is sweet and sharp and unbearable. Every frame feels right, every choice feels thought-out, considered. All adds up to a heartbreaking whole.  Advertisement The stories Frank tells are escapist cliffhangers starring the two brothers battling pirates and Nazis and triumphing over unimaginable odds. When they were kids, their father abandoned them, their mother died (but not before exacting a promise that the brothers would stick together), and, after a freak accident with a moving train, Jerry Lee had to have a leg amputated. Life has been one long sorry stream of bad luck ever since. In the stories Frank tells, Jerry Lee has two legs, of course. In the stories Frank tells both brothers are tall and handsome and strong and capable. We see these stories unfold before us in crackling pencil animations woven throughout the film, witty and riveting, a representation of Jerry Lee's illustrations come to life.  We meet the brothers in fragments and glimpses. We see them as kids, we see them as men. Their bond is unmistakable, and perhaps unhealthily so, but the film lives in the belljar of the brothers' reality, where they have no one else in the world but one another. Frank has friends (people he can hit up for cash, that is), but Jerry Lee's only contact with the outside world is through his brother. The motel rooms they live in are so unwelcoming you can feel how cold the tile is, how thin the stream of water in the shower, how dingy the blankets. Frank is the responsible one, and that's not saying much. He scrambles for every dollar in his pocket. He is haunted by Annie (Dakota Fanning), a girl he dumped. She was sweet and loyal, and had similar escapist tendencies (she also liked Frank's stories), but she was forced into prostitution by her horrible mother and Frank can't forgive it. He's obviously a one-woman kind of man. He cannot get over her. Jerry Lee seems challenged in a way that goes far beyond his physical handicap. Whatever might be wrong with him is not made explicit, and Stephen Dorff's performance is a damn near masterpiece of pathos, bringing \"The Motel Life\" into \"Of Mice and Men\" territory, clearly one of the story's original influences. When Frank steals a dog (it was going to freeze to death being tied up in that front yard anyway), and tells Jerry Lee about it, Dorff's face cracks in a childlike smile that is almost unbearable to witness in its uninhibited joy, saying, \"We always wanted a dog!\" The \"We\" is eloquent.  After a hit-and-run accident on an icy night when Jerry Lee accidentally kills a young man with their car, any small hand-hold the two may have had on stability is lost. Frank helps Jerry Lee bust out of the hospital (his prosthetic leg has been lost in their travels), and they hole up in a motel, hiding from the cops, trying to figure out their next move. Well, Frank does the figuring because Jerry Lee is in a panic and emotional tailspin. The intimacy between these two actors is a miracle to behold. There is one scene where Frank helps Jerry Lee into the shower to clean him off. Dorff is stark naked, and Hirsch is clothed, and at one point they start giggling about the nudity and the close quarters (\"You got a big dick, Jerry Lee,\" Frank comments with a mix of embarrassment and admiration), and it was a beautiful moment of levity in a story of restless heartbreak, but also a perfect encapsulation of the weird intimacy between siblings. Films often get siblings wrong. Actors often are unable to convince us that they go way back to childhood together and have emerged from the same family. With Dorff and Hirsch, you never doubt it for one second.  Advertisement Jerry Lee has an imaginary girlfriend named Marge, and he covers the walls of their motel with drawings of her, a buxom pinup with a 1940s hairstyle. Jerry Lee is in awe that his brother had actually been in love, and, more importantly, that a girl had loved him back. He, Jerry Lee, has never had that. His eyes fill with tears as he talks to Frank about it, the wreckage of his face displaying a whirlwind of loneliness. Dorff's performance is magnificent, and is entirely lacking in big histrionic gestures or cathartic breakdowns or temper tantrums. His eyes look pained and gentle as he tries to comprehend what the hell this life has handed him. And Hirsch, as Frank, is a beautiful listener, a resourceful support system, and also damaged beyond repair himself.  The supporting cast is all great, especially Kris Kristofferson as a used-car salesman and stand-in father figure for Frank. He gives advice that is actually sound (unlike most of the other folks in the film), telling Frank, \"Don't make decisions thinking you're a low-life. Make decisions thinking you're a great man. Or at least a good man.\" The fact that Frank does not realize he is already a good man is one of the tragedies in the film. Motels are up there with the Automat, the drive-in, jukeboxes, and cars with tailfins, as emblematic of certain aspects of American culture. These things are familiar even if their heyday predates us. \"The Motel Life\" does not shy away from the seedy aspects of its world, but it also understands the dark glamor there (especially in a show-stopper of a scene through a casino). We have all been in such places, even if it is only through the movies, or through our books. We know those red leather booths, those cigarette machines, the neon, the geometric tile floors, the crappy art on the walls. It's already in us, it's a part of us.  With super strong performances and a mood so melancholy-thick that you ache to comfort these men, \"The Motel Life\" is still a beautifully warm film with a very kind heart. It does not push the characters or manipulate them. It does not worry too much about its plot. The film is wise enough to just stand back and let its characters be. What a refreshing change. What a beautiful and sad film."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Parade's End", "Review": "As Downton Abbey surges toward its fourth season, \"Parade's End\" could be altogether average and it would still benefit from Downton's popularity. Fortunately for Brit-TV junkies, this five-part, five-hour HBO/BBC miniseries is way above average, as evident from the glowing reception it received when it premiered on the Beeb last August. Widespread accolades are guaranteed to continue with its stateside premiere on HBO, and no wonder: the four source novels by the quintessentially British Ford Madox Ford (later combined as the \"Parade's End\" tetralogy) were adapted by Sir Tom Stoppard \u2014 the renowned playwright/screenwriter's first TV work in 30 years \u2014 and director Susanna White is on a hot streak after directing acclaimed TV adaptations of \"Bleak House\" and \"Jane Eyre,\" in addition to the family feature \"Nanny McPhee Returns\" and episodes of HBO's \"Generation Kill\" and \"Boardwalk Empire.\" When it comes to behind-the-camera pedigree, you don't get much classier than this. Advertisement Ford's novels pose an epic challenge of adaptation, which may explain why \"Parade's End\" lacks the organic flow of Downton Abbey, but further comparison is pointless: \"Parade's End\" is in a class by itself, and Stoppard has honored the essence of Ford's decade-spanning fiction without limiting himself to slavish fidelity. If the series' chronology feels occasionally uneven, it's also bolstered by Stoppard's original contributions, including the same deliciously droll humor that earned the writer an Oscar for scripting \"Shakespeare in Love.\" Stoppard's chronology is linear (as it is in the novels), with Part One (spanning 1908-12), establishing numerous characters while focusing on the story's central love triangle: Christopher Tietjens (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a dignified throwback to the now-fading Edwardian era, an aristocrat from a privileged, land-owning family. A brilliant officer in the Department of Statistics, Tietjens holds firm to the principled conviction that respectable men must adhere to a certain sense of \"parade,\" a code of conduct essential to self-respect and social standing.  Just one problem: Tietjen's noble values demand that he remain loyal to his unfaithful wife Sylvia (Rebecca Hall), a manipulative socialite who gives birth to a son who may or may not be his. Even as Sylvia shamelessly flirts with other men, Tietjens maintains a fa\u00e7ade of contentment until he meets Valentine Wannop (Adelaide Clemens), a young, high-spirited suffragette who represents everything new and progressive in rapidly-changing English society. Their connection is immediate and powerful, and yet Tietjens can't bring himself to kiss her when she gives him a clear and longed-for opportunity. Much of \"Parade's End\" explores his inner turmoil as he's caught between true love and marital misery. Advertisement World War I provides the backdrop for tidal shifts in history, as Edwardian peace gives way to chaos and carnage. When Tietjens is ordered to manipulate military statistics to bolster support for the war, he quits in disgust and joins the army, recovering from shell-shock in France while Valentine takes a teaching job in London and Sylvia continues \u2014 albeit chastely \u2014 to encourage the attention of would-be suitors. Tietjens is sent to the Western front, but while the trench battles in \"Parade's End\" merit comparison to similar scenes in \"Paths of Glory\" and \"Gallipoli,\" the Great War serves primarily as a catalyst for ongoing drama on the home front. It's here that Stoppard juggles a host of supporting characters and relationships, including an affair between Tietjens' colleague Vincent Macmaster (Stephen Graham) and Edith Duchemin (Anne-Marie Duff), the frustrated wife of an ill-fated minister (Rufus Sewell) who's keeping secrets of his own.  As war continues to fray the fabric of British society, \"Parade's End\" charts the destructive course of rumors that intensify Tietjens' marital dilemma to the point of taxing his sanity. Inadvertently encourged by Tietjens' less-principled brother Mark (Rupert Everett), the rumors have a tragic impact at Groby, the Tietjens family estate, while Valentine's family (led by her mother, played by Miranda Richardson) is ostracized for their pacifist stance against the war. These and other characters add depth to the miniseries, but only rarely do they register as dramatically as the central love triangle. \"Parade's End\" certainly benefits from their presence, but those roles (and performances) remain entirely secondary compared to the formidable trio of Cumberbatch, Hall and Clemens, an appealing Australian newcomer who bears sisterly resemblance to Michelle Williams, and is now clearly destined for stardom. (She is also featured in Baz Luhrmann's \"The Great Gatsby,\" due this spring.) Cumberbatch (who shot to fame as \"Sherlock\" and costars in this summer's \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" and the upcoming \"Hobbit\" sequels) continues his ascension as an unlikely star of old-school distinction: His seething intensity (and booming baritone) is a perfect match for his role as a good man struggling to maintain his integrity while emotionally coming apart at the seams. Hall's performance is equally remarkable for the way she elicits sympathy as Sylvia, even as the character remains despicably self-serving. Sylvia genuinely loves Tietjens, after all, and remains chaste despite flirtatious efforts to provoke her husband's jealousy. Sylvia is a mass of contradictions, and with the help of Stoppard's exquisite dialogue, Hall wrangles those contradictions into an emotionally complex, fully dimensional performance, portraying Sylvia as simultaneously devious, selfish, amoral, wounded, vulnerable, and victimized by forces beyond her control. Advertisement In stark contrast, Clemens fully embodies Valentine as a young, hopeful idealist who endearingly clings to notions of pure romantic love, even as those notions are challenged by the harsh reality of war and messy human behavior. She's a beacon of light in Tietjens' emotional darkness, representing the only future that Tietjens can bear to live in. With her cute blonde bob and beaming smile, Clemens radiates that light from within. \"Parade's End\" is a bit too sprawling to qualify as a masterpiece. It's easy to miss details amidst the density of Stoppard's dialogue (for example, listen closely for the explanation of Reverend Duchemin's fate), and some characters feel sketchy compared to the fully developed leads. And while White's direction achieves a rare degree of elegance on locations in England, Belgium and France, she's still making TV on a budget, relying (for example) on too many shots of spinning train wheels as visual shorthand for travel. (They reminded me of John Huston's humorously repetitive shots of airliners \u2014 pointing screen-left when westbound, screen-right when eastbound -- as a cross-country sight gag in \"Prizzi's Honor.\") I'm nitpicking, of course. Given such a wealth of literary adaptation, upscale direction and award-worthy performances, who's complaining?"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Visitors", "Review": "Godfrey Reggio's experimental \"Qatsi\" trilogy (\"Koyaanisqatsi\" (1982) \"Powaqqatsi\" (1989) and \"Naqoyatsi\" (2002)) made visual statements about the violent ways man has brought technology to bear upon the natural world and his own race. They weren't very subtle statements, but Reggio expressed them in kinetic images that kept your eye busy and often dazzled. \"Visitors\" is the first Reggio feature that feels more inert and random than purposeful and propulsive. Yet it's refreshing for having mostly avoided the soapbox in order to concentrate on ambiguous imagery. It's all in the title: based on the Hopi word for \"life,\" the Qatsi films added the Hopi terms for imbalance, transformation and war to hint that the modern world had become an unnatural disaster. But \"Visitors\"\u2014what does that word tell us? We are left with a million possibilities and a stately stream of visual mysteries. Advertisement  Yes, this is all plastic-bag-on-the-wind type stuff, and I wonder how much patience I would have for it without the hypno-music of Reggio's longtime collaborator, Philip Glass. Glass's signature repetitious motifs, always churning toward resolution yet continually denying it, carry us in suspense across shots that last minutes, not seconds. As form-fitting scores, go, Glass's work for \"Visitors\" feels skintight. Reggio's process includes making sure Glass is \"marinated\" in the film's footage before writing a single note. It's Glass who gives \"Visitors\" something like a structure, alternating between long, contemplative stretches and moments of ecstatic grandeur, like the crowd of sports fans who erupt in (extreme slow-motion) joy at some victory. In a film flush with gorgeous black and white images, a sequence set in a swamp has stayed on my mind's eye the longest since seeing \"Visitors.\" Ancient trees with the texture of lizard skin, leaves that billow or hang limp like hair and brackish water the consistency of lentil soup describe another world, smack in the middle of Louisiana. Here the filmmakers take an image familiar from a thousand National Geographic spreads and makes it new. Two impulses struggle in Reggio's work. He has often said that he intends his films to be non-intellectual and visceral, bypassing reason to achieve a physiological response. At the same time, a definite idea about The Way We Live Now always creeps into the process. In \"Visitors,\" Reggio expands on an idea pursued in his short film \"Evidence\", in which children stared at television reflected off a two-way mirror. Behind the mirror was a movie camera\u2014the viewer, essentially. In \"Visitors,\" people of all ages seem to stare at us while actually peering into computer screens and video games. It's clear that Reggio finds something disturbing about that, but he lets Glass strike the tone of fascinated lament. The rest he leaves up to us."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Wolves", "Review": "\"Wolves\"\r\n is the kind of pleasantly eccentric werewolf coming-of-age story that \r\nshould be seen as the third-billed title in a horror movie marathon. \r\nWhen viewed on its own, one can't help but wonder who \"Wolves\"'\r\n was made for. Writer/director David Hayter, most famous as the \r\nvoice-actor who plays Solid Snake in the \"Metal Gear Solid\" video game \r\nseries, typically errs on the side of caution, and only tentatively lets\r\n his id run roughshod over his corny, Stephen King-like story. \"Wolves\"\r\n is consequently too violent to be a \"Twilight\" knockoff, and too cuddly\r\n to be an effectively freaky tale of a boy who, to paraphrase \"Werewolf \r\nBar Mitzvah,\" becomes a man while also becoming a wolf.Hayter's\r\n quasi-adult family drama is set in a world defined by tacky, \r\npseudo-archetypal heartland Americana (ie: corn fields and roadhouses). \r\nAll of the film's principal characters are werewolves, a creative \r\ndecision that suggests Hayter took at least a page or two out of \r\nStephenie Meyer's domesticated-monster playbook.\u00a0\"Wolves\"\r\n is set in a world where the status quo is maintained absolutely by \r\nwerewolves, making it difficult to see Cayden Richards (Lucas Till), the\r\n film's pubescent lead protagonist, as a real outsider.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Super 8", "Review": "With its night skies filled with mystery, its kids racing around town on bicycles and its flashlights forming visible beams in the air, \"Super 8\" has the visual signatures of an early Spielberg movie. Its earnest young heroes stumble upon an awesome mystery and try to investigate it themselves. And as an Ohio town experiences frightening events, we feel poised between \"The Goonies\" and a 1950s sci-fi film with the characters lined up side by side and looking in alarm at an awesome sight. The associations are deliberate. Steven Spielberg produced the film, and its director, J.J. Abrams, worked in lowly roles on early Spielberg movies before going on to make \"Mission Impossible III\" (2006) and \"Star Trek\" (2009) \u2014 and produce \"Lost\" on TV. What they're trying to do is evoke the innocence of an \u201cE.T.\u201d while introducing a more recent level of special effects. There are really two movies here, one about the world of the kids and one about the expectations of the audience, and \"Super 8\" leads a charmed life until the second story takes command. Advertisement Set in the 1970s, it opens with its 12-year-old hero, Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), helping his intense friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make an 8mm zombie movie for a local film festival. This of course must be done in secret, not so much because parents would forbid it, but because it's fun to operate with stealth. Besotted by stories of other young directors (no doubt including Spielberg), they scout locations, improvise costumes and energetically apply zombie makeup.  In this they are greatly assisted by 14-year-old Alice (Elle Fanning), who not only plays the zombie mother but just as important, sneaks out with her father's car to drive them all to a midnight shoot at the local train station. A great opportunity develops when a train comes rumbling out of the night. \"Action!\" Charles shouts, and Joe and Alice try to perform their dialogue as the train rumbles past. Then a pickup truck appears, racing on the tracks toward the train. The train wreck goes on and on and on, tossing railroad cars around like dominoes. You would think a freight car loaded with heavy metals couldn't fly very high into the sky, but you'd be wrong. This is a sensationally good action sequence, up there with the airplane crash in \"Knowing.\" Yes, something ominous is happening, but I'd better not say what. Part of the delicious fun of the film is the way it toys with portents. For example, Joe's dog disappears. He tacks up a card on a notice board. We see that countless dogs have disappeared. Later, there's a map of where missing dogs have been found. The dots form a ring around the city. All the dogs ran out of town. This moment reminded me of the great shot in \"The Thing\" (1952), when the scientists stood on the outline of something in the Antarctic ice and when Howard Hawks' camera drew back, we saw they were in a circle. Advertisement Meanwhile, human elements come into play. Joe's mother was killed not long ago in an accident at the steel mill. He mourns her. His father, Deputy Sheriff Jack Lamb (Kyle Chandler). has grown distant and depressive. Joe be\u00adgins to bond with Alice, who is two years older but sympathetic and nice. There's an oddly touching scene where he helps her with her zombie makeup.  It is a requirement of these films that adults be largely absent. The kids get involved up to their necks, but the grown-ups seem slow to realize strange things are happening. Here, the mystery centers on the cargo of the cars in the train wreck, and on the sudden materialization of U.S. Air Force investigators and troops in town. If we don't instinctively know it from this movie, we know it from a dozen earlier ones: The authorities are trying to cover up something frightening, and the kids are on the case. During the first hour of \"Super 8,\" I was elated by how good it was. It was like seeing a lost early Spielberg classic. Then something started to slip. The key relationship of Alice and her troubled father Louis (Ron Eldard) went through an arbitrary U-turn. Joe's own father seemed to sway with the requirements of the plot. The presentation of the threat was done with obscure and unconvincing special effects. We want the human stories and the danger to mesh perfectly, and they seem to slip past one another. All the same, \"Super 8\" is a wonderful film, nostalgia not for a time but for a style of filmmaking, when shell-shocked young audiences were told a story and not pounded over the head with aggressive action. Abrams treats early adolescence with tenderness and affection. He uses his camera to accumulate emotion. He has the rural town locations right. And he does an especially good job with Joe, Alice, Charles and their friends, especially Cary (Ryan Lee). You know how a lot of heist and action movies have an explosives expert? Cary is the kid who is always playing with matches and fireworks. There was always some kid like that in school. The grown-ups said if he kept on like that he'd blow off a finger. We were rather grateful for the suspense. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Mountains of the Moon", "Review": "Based (quite faithfully) on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's beloved novel, the long-awaited film \"Mountains of the Moon\" (2013) (\"Chander Pahar\") mirrors its protagonist's adventure in terms of scale: It's both one of the most expensive Bengali-language films ever made and is shot almost entirely in South Africa. The story\u2014detailing young Bengali Shankar Roy Chowdhury's time in early 20th century Africa, when danger finds him at his quiet job at a remote railway station, after which he goes out in search of more in the company of a Portuguese adventurer whose life he randomly saves\u2014is rich with event, and certainly the stuff of a classic adventure yarn. There is, however, more to a movie than its script. Someone, at some point, has to film it, and there is where things go wrong.  Advertisement Considering that \"one of the most expensive Bengali-language films ever made\" cost a mere $2.5 million US, beating it up over the terrible digital FX would be a little unfair, especially considering that some of the effects, like a particularly lengthy volcanic eruption, look faintly Ray Harryhausen-esque if you squint, which is an asset to the type of old-fashioned adventure picture \"Chander Pahar\" sets out to be. The guilelessness of the presentation is as well, aided immensely by a sincere and warm performance as Shankar by Dev, one of the biggest stars of the Tollywood (that's the Bengali Hollywood) film industry and rightfully so.   Where the film stumbles\u2014or more accurately, never stands up at all\u2014is in the direction. I have admittedly not seen Kamaleswar Mukherjee's first two films, and so can't speak to whether this is an issue with his filmmaking in general, or whether this is specific to the challenges of working on a larger-than-customary scale in a foreign country, but literally every aspect of the work he does in \"Mountains of the Moon\" fails. The compositions are dull. The scenes are flimsy and shapeless. The pacing is the direct antithesis of what normally induces the excitement of adventure. Continuing the litany would be gratuitous except to point out one recurrent peculiarity, which is that the world of \"Mountains of the Moon\" is one in which guns can apparently only be fired after running slowly for five minutes and then jumping, twisting backward, and firing two shots that miss by a mile. (This happens several times; it never occurs to anyone to stand, distribute their weight evenly, and aim for the center of their target.)  A byproduct of \"Mountains of the Moon\" lacking the narrative drive to be a successful adventure movie is that it allows for far too much time to contemplate some of the less savory aspects of the genre. To wit, old-timey adventure yarns, be they set in Africa or elsewhere, all too often feature horrible racial stereotypes, and this is no exception, featuring tribespeople identical in every regard to their counterparts in movies seventy-five years ago. There's one conversation between Dev's Shankar and another Indian, in Africa with the British Army, about colonialism, but the story drops\u00a0 the subject immediately, never to return to it. There's also a distinctly anachronistic attitude toward humanity's relationship with nature, one manifestation of which will get the movie off to a rocky start with any animal lovers. These complaints aren't necessary related to the technical quality of the movie itself, but it's pointless to pretend that we watch movies in a vacuum.  That last point carries over to the question of whether or not one grew up with the book. If yes, \"Mountains of the Moon\" is doubtlessly essential viewing, and many of the directorial missteps may very well be irrelevant in the face of finally getting to see the story on the screen after all these years. Absent that, there isn't much to recommend the film, which only escapes being truly awful by a complete absence of meanness and a compelling lead performance by Dev.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Blancanieves", "Review": "Note: The following was reworked from a blog post that Roger Ebert filed from the 2012 Toronto Film Festival. In late March, he requested that it be refashioned into a review because he was not feeling well enough to write one from scratch. \"Blancanieves\" was one of 12 films invited to this year's Ebertfest, and Roger was one of the movie's biggest champions. As director Pablo Berger urged Ebertfest attendees, \"If you like this film, spread the word, in honor of Roger.\" -- Laura Emerick It's too soon to declare a trend, but a silent film once again seems likely to become a success in the contemporary film world: \"Blancanieves,\" a striking, visually stunning Spanish feature, written and directed by Pablo Berger.\u00a0 Advertisement Although the story draws on the Brothers Grimm and the legend of Snow White, it is anything but a children's movie. It is a full-bodied silent film of the sort that might have been made by the greatest directors of the 1920s, if such details as the kinky sadomasochism of this film's evil stepmother could have been slipped past the censors. The delightful \"The Artist,\" which slipped away with last year's Academy Award for best picture, cheated a little by having tongue-in-cheek fun with its silence, and even allowing a few words to sneak in. \"Blancanieves\" exploits the silent medium for its strengths, including the fact that it can so easily deal with fantasy. This is as exciting, in many of the same ways, as the greatest traditional silent masterpieces by Dreyer, Pabst or Murnau. It's a Spanish film, but of course silent films speak an international language. The story opens with a famous matador, Antonio Villalta (Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho), who is filled with swaggering ego. All goes wrong for him. He is paralyzed in the ring, and his beloved wife dies in childbirth. Their daughter, Carmen, is raised by her grandmother until her death. Antonio unwisely marries the heartless Encarna (Maribel Verdu), his former nurse, who wants only his money and ignores him as he sits in a wheelchair in his room.\u00a0 After Carmen is orphaned, Encarna allows the child to come and live with her and her father, only to give her a room in the barn and put her to work at hard labor. Encarna, meanwhile, dominates the household's chauffeur in classic boot-and-whip style. Eventually, Carmen manages to sneak into the mansion and bond with her father, who teaches her the art of bullfighting. Fed up with caring for her invalid husband, Encarna hastens his demise. She also orders the chauffeur to eliminate the now-teenage Carmen.\u00a0 Left for dead in a nearby river, Carmen is discovered by a troupe of dwarves, Los Enanitos Toreros. They are bullfighters who travel between cities and look like characters out of a Tod Browning film. They name her Blancanieves, Spanish for Snow White. When one of them is wounded, she leaps into the ring and distracts the bull, using the matador skills she learned from her father. Eventually she, too, becomes a famed matador. This film is a wonderment, urged along by a full-throated romantic score. Carmen as a child is performed lovably by the angelic Sof\u00eda Oria and as an adult, Macarena Garc\u00eda. As with \"The Artist,\" I believe audiences will discover they like silent films more than they think they do. The silents offer experiences and dimensions different from talking pictures.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Cassandra's Dream", "Review": "By Roger Ebert Woody Allen's \"Cassandra's Dream\" is about two brothers, one single and modestly successful and one struggling but in a happy relationship, who are both desperate to raise money, and agree to commit a crime together. The identical premise is used in Sidney Lumet's \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,\" which is like a master class in how Allen goes wrong. The Lumet film uses actors (Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman) who don't look like brothers but feel like brothers. Allen's actors (Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell) look like brothers but don't really feel related. Lumet's film involves family members in a crime that seems reasonable but goes spectacularly wrong. Allen has a family member propose a crime that seems spectacularly unreasonable and goes right, with, however, unforeseen consequences. One of the brothers in both movies is consumed with guilt. And so on. Advertisement Lumet seems comfortable with his milieu, middle-class affluence in a New York suburb. Allen's milieu is not and perhaps never will be the Cockney working class of London, and his actors seem as much tourists as he is. Nevertheless, they plug away in a plot that is intrinsically absorbing at times, even with so much going against it. McGregor and Farrell play Ian and Terry Blaine, Ian a partner in his dad's restaurant, Terry a hard-drinking, chain-smoking garage mechanic. Terry at least seems comfortable with his life and his supportive girlfriend (Sally Hawkins), although he dreams of getting rich quick; he gambles unwisely at the dog tracks. Ian also wants cash, and not only for a fishy-sounding opportunity to invest in California hotels. While driving a classic Jaguar borrowed from the garage where his brother works, he meets a high-maintenance sexpot actress (Hayley Atwell), and presents himself as a \"property speculator\" far richer than he is. The brothers share a dream to own a boat. Terry wins big at the track, enough to buy a rusty bilge bucket, fix it up and have a great day sailing with their two girls. But then Terry loses big time, owes \u00a390,000 and discovers that guys are after him to break his legs. That's when rich Uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson) returns from China (or somewhere) to make a proposition. His business empire is built on fraud, a colleague is about to squeal, and Howard wants the boys to do him a favor and murder the man. Wilkinson, always a cool persuader, couches this in terms of family loyalty. That convinces the boys not nearly as much as does their own desperation. What happens I will not detail. This stretch of the movie does work, and involves us, but then the lads run smack into an ending that is, to me, completely possible but highly unsatisfactory. Its problem is its sheer blundering plausibility. Allen's great \"Match Point\" (2005), however, also about crime and social con games, has an ending that is completely implausible, and sublimely satisfactory. Remember how that ring falls at the end? What is fiction for, if not to manipulate the possible? Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "We Are the Best!", "Review": "Resembling a Swedish after-school special tailored for American art houses, Lukas Moodysson\u2019s \"We Are the Best\" tells of two girls who, in the Stockholm of 1982, decide to become punk rockers and enlist a third girl to form a band, which is never within a million miles of being good, even by the ragged standards of punk, but still considers itself to be \"the best.\" The film\u2019s winsome, self-satisfied comedy will no doubt appeal more to viewers who prize juvenile hi-jinks over the cultural moment it depicts. Advertisement As anyone familiar with punk during its late-'70s/early-'80s heyday will recall, its musicians were overwhelmingly males in their late teens and early 20s. Still, taking that reality and spinning in a female direction is a perfectly valid idea. The curious thing here, though, is that the two main girls, doughy Bobo (Mira Barkhammar) and impish Klara (Mira Grosin), look like boys, and not just because of their unflattering haircuts and lack of makeup. Though they are supposed to be 13, they could easily pass for nine or ten, which means that they resemble pre-pubescent males rather than punk\u2019s raging adolescents. Is this meant to signal that the rebellious girls don\u2019t give a fig about gender norms? Or does it inadvertently signal that only girls who don\u2019t look like girls can have a go at punk? However you parse this, the film\u2019s most crucial emphasis undeniably involves age rather than gender: In making its main characters so young\u2014and appearing even younger\u2014it effectively infantilizes punk, making it a matter of child\u2019s play (literally) rather than teenage anxieties and energies. Again, only those who still value punk as a particular cultural phenomenon rather than the premise for a kiddie sitcom are likely to be bothered by this, and Moodysson astutely begins his film with claims that \"punk is dead.\" Indeed, by 1982, punk\u2019s original ferocity was clearly fading, which is why there\u2019s some credibility to the notion that, rather than expiring outright, in Sweden it was simply trickling down to the middle-school level. For Bobo and Klara, school is a drag, as are their convention-bound schoolmates, so they verge off into a clique of two, disdaining the clueless around them and picking up instruments in the school practice space of a teen heavy metal group called Iron Fist. Imitating their punk heroes, the duo makes aggressive noise and shout angry lyrics. (The only song they come up with is translated \"Hate the Sport!\" in the subtitles. \"I Hate Sports\" is the gist.) But here \"punk\" really isn\u2019t about music; it\u2019s about cheeky attitude. Advertisement Eventually realizing that they need to expand if they\u2019re to really be a band, they set their sights on Hedvig (Liv LeMoyne), a demure and comely student who\u2019s skilled at playing acoustic guitar and singing. Though Hedvig\u2019s a Christian, something Bobo and Klara find very non-punk, they recruit her via friendship, which she evidently needs. Unlike them, she looks like an actual teenager, but after they hide her figure in baggy punk clothes and shear off her beautiful long blonde hair, she too looks like a boy\u2014a very pretty one. While most of the film has a loose knit, anecdotal air, dramatic complications arise when the three go off to a nearby town to meet the members of a punk trio they admire. It\u2019s clear they\u2019re hoping for dates rather than musical advice, but they arrive to make the awkward discovery that the band has shed one of its members, so it\u2019s three girls and two boys. After Klara makes a connection with one of the guys, Bobo jealously goes behind her back and tries to sabotage the budding romance. In real life, or a more dyspeptic and authentic punk rock movie, that interference might lead to the band\u2019s dissolution, if not Sid and Nancy-style mayhem. But \"We Are the Best\" is not that kind of movie. It\u2019s the happy-face, kids-are-alright punk rock movie, in which the two friends make up after their spat and end up on stage shouting the title\u2019s inane self-affirmation at a roomful of pissed-off provincials.  Moodyson gets spirited, engaging performances from his three young leads, and his directing style, which includes lots of handheld camera and zooming into close-ups of the leads, lends an air of both intimacy and improvisation. It\u2019s very capable and audience-pleasing work, which of course means that nothing about it is very punk-rock."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Lucy", "Review": "Imagine a stranger-in-a-strange-land revenge thriller about a wide-eyed Anglo bombshell (Scarlett Johansson) who gets kidnapped and abused in Taiwan by nasty, sweaty, shouting Korean gangsters and then escapes to seek justice. Then imagine this same movie starring, say, a lightning fast kick boxer who can knock a dozen opponents' teeth out before they can raise a single fist. Now imagine this same movie injected with a dose of apocalyptic science fiction, with the woman gaining strange powers as the story unfolds. Then envision midnight-movie touches mixed into the filmmaking: flash cuts of predators and prey enhancing otherwise typical scenes of plans being hatched; monologues about brain capacity and the true meaning of time coupled with psychedelic visions and wormholes and explanatory objects materializing from thin air.\u00a0 Advertisement That's Luc Besson's \"Lucy,\" a thriller about an American woman who gets kidnapped into service as a drug mule bearing an experimental synthetic hormone, accidentally absorbs some of it, then sheds her physical, intellectual and perceptual limitations.\u00a0I could describe five or six other kinds of movies that in some way also echo \"Lucy.\" Sections may remind you of the original \"The Matrix\" and the last hour of \"Akira,\" and the final ten minutes play like a Greatest Hits of science-fiction \"trip\" movies. You've seen a lot of the individual situations and filmmaking techniques in \"Lucy\" as well. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to identify one idea, scene or element in the picture that is not a cliche. \u00a0 But the total package feels fresh. From the minute that Johansson's title character suffers a beating in captivity that ruptures the drugs in her stomach and releases them into her bloodstream (a Yankee nightmare), the film enters a realm of continual delight, though not always surprise. There's no point naming any of the other major characters, as there really are no other characters, only types: the arrogant fat-cat drug dealer (Choi Min-Sik) who thinks he can control the short blond drug mule and learns the hard way that he can't; the brilliant, deep-voiced scientist (Morgan Freeman, who else?) whose theoretical studies of the human brain's untapped potential make him an information source and then finally a kind of partner-savior to Lucy; the handsome nice-guy Parisian cop (Amr Waked) who assists Lucy during her climactic mission to acquire more of the experimental hormone to ingest and become whatever it is that she's becoming: a 1950s sci-fi monster, probably\u2014the kind that cannot be killed because everything you shoot at it makes it stronger and hungrier. Lucy is little more than a type herself\u2014a representative of humanity in its un-mutated, non-super state. Johannson's mid-career transformation from husky-voiced ingenue to intensely physical matinee idol is one of the more fascinating arcs in American cinema. It's only her control over her body, voice and eyes\u2014and maybe our awareness that her performances in this movie, \"Her\" and \"Under the Skin\" are all of a piece; Lucy even uses the phrase \"under the skin\" at one point!\u2014that stops \"Lucy\" from being tiresome. Her work keeps us from realizing that Besson's script has botched the chance to tell a deeper story, one that's not just bombastically exciting and superficially clever, but quietly tragic. Advertisement \"Lucy\" starts with shots of the prehistoric ape-woman Lucy and periodically returns to her throughout the story, not-too-subtly comparing the heroine's transformation to that of the species itself (\"from evolution to revolution,\" to quote one of the script's more pungent phrases).\u00a0And yet there are only two moments that make us really understand and empathize with Lucy as something other than a cipher who represents the un-evolved human. One is an early scene of her being terrorized and abused by Taiwanese drug thugs: Lucy's abject helplessness here is hard to watch. The other occurs deeper in the story when Lucy realizes she's about to embark on a terrifying and probably one-way transformative journey and phones her mom. The scene is shot mostly in tight closeup. The dialogue has a goofy Proustian boldness: \"I remember the taste of your milk in my mouth ... I want to thank you for a thousand kisses that I can feel on my face.\"\u00a0 That scene is so brazenly powerful that in retrospect it made me wish the main character had gone on a journey with more emotional gradations. Heck, I'd have settled for more than the two that Besson deigns to give us: \"Oh, my God, these guys want to kill me\" and \"I am God, watch me kill these guys.\" When the hormones enter Lucy's bloodstream it's as if a switch has been flipped. The heroine starts speaking in monotone and tilting her head at looming men like a quizzical bird regarding a worm that it's about to devour. She's woman-as-Terminator. The Terminator is a great movie monster, but there's a reason why it's a supporting character in the films that bear its name. Like many films by Besson\u2014\"The Professional,\" \"The Fifth Element,\" \"The Messenger\" and other high-octane shoot-'em-ups\u2014\"Lucy\" starts out riveting but becomes less engaging as it goes along. It keeps introducing potentially rich narrative veins and then failing to tap them. It too often falls back on gunplay and gore just when you think it might finally delve into the notions that it keeps serving up with such fanfare (the falseness of the idea of uniqueness; the self-defeating nature of a species \"more concerned with having than being\"; time as \"the one true unit of measure\"). \u00a0 Advertisement Nevertheless: \"Lucy\" is a fun, confident work. It's fast and tight and playful even when it's sadistic and violent, which is often. It lasts about 90 minutes and change but feels longer in a good way, because every second is packed tight. It's full of itself, yet it still keeps winking at you. It wants to be taken seriously, but not so seriously that you don't laugh at (and with) the sight of Lucy strolling into a gunfight wearing nosebleed heels, or making enemies writhe like marionettes on invisible strings. The movie is alive. It pops."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Four Lovers", "Review": "At one point in \"Four Lovers,\" the four lovers go into the pantry of an old French country house, pour bags full of white flour on the cobblestone floor, strip and roll around in the flour while having sex. They begin languorously, in voluptuous caresses, but you can't fool me. Cobblestones have a decided detumescent effect. If you ever find yourself in such a situation, insist on being the missionary. This is a movie about two married couples who decide to share each other's mates. There is little fascinating about them before they decide this, and still less after, because when it comes right down to it, looking at a lot of sex is not nearly as much fun as having it. The rolling around in the flour sequence is so tedious, I had to fast-forward through part of it. (I saw this film on a DVD screener.) You know there's something wrong with a sex movie when the good parts are the dialogue. Advertisement In Paris, we meet Rachel (Marina Fois), a designer of jewelry, and husband Franck (Roschdy Zem), who gives expert shiatsu massages and is writing a book titled Feng Shui for Couples. The book will explain why the bed has to face south and the cash register north, unless I have them mixed up. Their jewelry line needs help with its website, and they call in Vincent (Nicolas Duvauchelle), a software expert. As Vincent leans above Rachel at her keyboard, they feel unexpectedly strong erotic currents. Haven't we all sometimes felt that grateful for computer advice? Not long after, the two couples, also including Vincent's wife, Teri (Elodie Bouchez), meet for dinner. Teri was an Olympic gymnast for France and now sits on the floor because her back has been giving her some trouble. Franck offers her a back massage, which begins with his fingers pressing and counting off each vertebrae while he names them, and when they reach the femur, Teri is feeling a lot better all over. They kiss. Now both couples are in play, and they decide to begin trading partners. Why? Why is not a word you should bring with you to this movie. Pourquoi pas? Is it possible for two couples to swap mates without jealousy? I doubt it. The men are the problem. When a husband is assured by his wife that he satisfies her just as much as the other man, I submit to you there's not a husband on earth capable of believing that. Women are more trusting, because sex is not the dominant theme in their life from age 13 to decrepitude.  All four people are attractive, although Vincent has too many tattoos for my taste. He has a word in large letters running from one shoulder blade to the other, in an unreadable typeface he must have found on the web. My advice: stick to Helvetica. The four lovers become best friends, while effortlessly raising three children. Can this idyll last forever? No. One afternoon while they're making love, Franck gets Teri to help him shift her bed closer to the window for feng-shui reasons. They forget the time, and when Vincent returns home unexpectedly, he is annoyed, not to find them in bed together, but to find the bed has been moved. That's going too far. Advertisement When Franck presses his wife to describe any of Vincent's problems, the best she can do is report that sometimes he has \"trouble.\" What say? Trouble getting an erection? No, getting over it, if you see what I mean. I can understand why this might be a problem for Rachel, but Rachel, honey, it's not what Franck wants to hear. The best parts of the film, for me, came toward the end, when the lives of the four lovers become bittersweet and melancholy. They were so happy for a time. They were inseparable. Now it is all over. There's a flashback where they walk together down to the farm pond to wash off the flour. As they dry contentedly in the sun, Teri still has a little flour behind her ear. You can't do better than that."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "A Woman in Berlin", "Review": "In the final weeks of World War II, the conquering Soviet Army occupied a Berlin in ruins and did what occupying armies often do, raped and pillaged. There was nothing to stop them -- least of all their officers, who knew that after years of relentless battle it was useless to try to enforce discipline, even had they wanted to. \"A Woman in Berlin\" is a diary written at that time and published some 15 years later. Its author, who identifies herself as a journalist, was anonymous. The book's publication in 1959 inspired outrage in Germany, where the idea of German women cooperating somewhat with the Soviets was unthinkable, and in Russia, where it soiled the honor of the Red Army. Advertisement In that time, in that place, women were raped. \"How many times?\" asks one of another, and they both know the subject of the question. The diary and film are about how the author attempted to control the terms of her defilement by deliberately seeking out a high-ranking Russian who would act as her protector. Who is to say this was wrong of her? The woman, Anonyma, is played by Nina Hoss, who in two other films released here in the past year, \"Yella\" and \"Jerichow,\" has emerged as a strong, confident actress with innate star quality. She is seen here in an early shot at a party, elegantly dressed, ruling the room, a proud Nazi, proposing a toast to the brave boys at the front. At the time, it appeared Germany would conquer Europe. By the end of the war, her husband has disappeared in battle, and she is camped out with other women in the remnants of a bombed-out building. They are exhausted, dirty, hungry, frightened. They were all raised in the comfortable middle class, and now find themselves scrambling like animals for food and shelter. The obvious sources of food and drink are the Russians. Most of them are crude, even bestial, but then the women cannot be choosers. Anonyma had luck seducing a lieutenant and then sets her sights on a major, Andrei (Yevgeni Sidikhin) who is the top-ranking officer in sight. He's also by far the most complex. He resists her come-on at first, perhaps because he's fastidious, more likely because he simply doesn't see himself as that kind of man. Something unspoken passes between them. They grow closer. Yes, she profits from their liaison, and yes, he eventually takes up her offer. But for each there is the illusion that this is something they choose to do. What little I know about war suggests that sometimes it comes down to a choice between two dismaying courses of action. Some people would rather die than lose their honor. Most people would rather not die, particularly if their deaths would not change anything. Anonyma and Andrei are people with similar sensibilities, similar feelings, now divested of the illusions they presumably brought with them into the war. That is the movie's insight, and the book's, too, I assume. This isn't a love story in any palpable sense. It is a story about how things were. \"A Woman in Berlin\" finds no particular point in the story, and no one is heroic in any sense. The woman and man make the best accommodation they can with the reality that confronts them. There are several subplots involving other women and other soldiers, and one involves a woman who is subtly pleased by the power her body gives her. Well, she's not the first such woman, or man. The film is well-acted, with restraint, by Hoss and Sidikhin. The writer and director, Max Faerberboeck, employs a level gaze and avoids for the most part artificial sentimentality. The physical production is convincing. The movie is just enough too long that we realize we've already seen everything it has to observe. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Hairspray", "Review": "\"Hairspray\" is just plain fun. Or maybe not so plain. There's a lot of craft and slyness lurking beneath the circa-1960s goofiness. The movie seems guileless and rambunctious, but it looks just right (like a Pat Boone musical) and sounds just right (like a Golden Oldies disc) and feels just right (like the first time you sang \"We Shall Overcome\" and until then it hadn't occurred to you that we should). It bounces out of bed with Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a roly-poly bundle of joy, whose unwavering cheerfulness shines on the whole movie. \"Good morning, Baltimore!\" she sings, as she dances through a neighborhood where everyone seems to know and love her, even the garbagemen who let her ride on the roof of their back-loader. She's like a free-lance cheerleader. Advertisement At school she links up with best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), whose name is undoubtedly a tribute to Penny Singleton, who played Dagwood's Blondie. They live for the moment when the minute hand crawls with agonizing slowness to the end of the school day, and they can race home and dance along with \"The Corny Collins Show,\" the local teenage TV danceathon. In those days, every local market had a show like that. Eventually Dick Clark plowed them under with \"American Bandstand.\" I miss their freshness and naivete. Corny (James Marsden) is well named, as he presides over a posse of Popular Kids known as his Council. Tracy longs to be on the Council. The star of the show and head of the Council is Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow), whose mother Wilma (Michelle Pfeiffer) manages the station and enforces an all-white policy for the show, except for the monthly Negro Day organized by Maybelle (Queen Latifah), owner of a record shop. All of this is recycled from the original 1988 John Waters film, which made Ricki Lake a star, and from the Broadway musical made from the Waters movie, but it's still fresh the third time around. It's a little more innocent than Waters would have made it, but he does his part by turning up in a cameo role as a flasher (look quick and you see Ricki Lake, too, and Pia Zadora). The plot involves Tracy's instinctive decency as she campaigns to integrate the program, endangering her campaign to get on the Council. Tradition requires Edna, Tracy's mother, to be played by a man in drag: Divine in the film, Harvey Fierstein in the musical, and this time, John Travolta, who may be wearing a fat suit but still moves like the star of \"Saturday Night Fever.\" Wilbur, Edna's father, is played by Christopher Walken, who has a hairpiece surely borrowed from his store, which is named \"Hardy Har Har,\" and sells jokes and novelties. Oh, how I miss the Whoopie Cushion. The plot wheels right along while repairing one outpost of Baltimore racism, and what's remarkable is that some fairly serious issues get discussed in song and dance. Tracy is sent to detention one day and learns a whole new style of dancing from the black students there, and takes it to TV, reminding me of the days when TV preachers thought Elvis was the spawn of Satan. Now they look like him. Call in today for your \"free\" healing water. Advertisement The point, however, is not the plot but the energy. Without somebody like Nikki Blonsky at the heart of the movie, it might fall flat, but everybody works at her level of happiness, including her teen contemporaries Zac Efron, Taylor Parks and Elijah Kelley (the last two Maybelle's children), and the usual curio-shop window full of peculiar adults (Jerry Stiller, who played Wilbur in the 1988 movie, and Paul Dooley). You know the story, you've seen the movie and heard all about the musical, and you think you know what to expect. But the movie seems to be happening right now, or right then, and its only flaw as a period picture is that there aren't enough Studebakers in it."}

In large part because Chomsky is a very good speaker with a wealth of incisive ideas to share, the result is a film that feels less like a lecture than a provocative X-ray of current American political realities. Advertisement It couldn\u2019t be more timely, not only because the idea that it is its heart\u2014the impact of the concentration of wealth and power on our politics\u2014has received so much attention of late, but more specifically because its animating concerns are central to the current year\u2019s presidential election. For that reason, its appeal could be more ecumenical than might be assumed. How many Americans currently would agree that the American dream is in big trouble? A good percentage, recent polls suggest. That\u2019s why Chomsky\u2019s leftist analysis, as a starting point for discussion at the very least, could offer as much food for thought for the supporters of Donald J. Trump as it will sustenance for Bernie Sanders\u2019 legions. The film\u2019s title aptly pinpoints its area of interest. Though Chomsky, a veteran MIT professor who first gained renown for his groundbreaking work in linguistics, comments frequently on global conflicts and America\u2019s involvement therein, we hear almost nothing on those subjects here (which even the film\u2019s admirers might consider a weakness). The upside to this decision, though, is that the discussion has a tight, logical focus that aids its clarity and organization. In essense, Chomsky asks why America seemed to reach the zenith of its economic and civic vibrancy in the 1950s and \u201860s and then go into a decline that has left few except the top tenth of a percent of Americans truly fulfilled or satisfied. To answer the question, he constructs a narrative that entwines ideas and events, both harkening back to 1776. In that year, British moral philosopher Adam Smith published \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201d in which he argued that merchants and manufacturers dominate government in defense of their own interests regardless of how it affects the rest of society. In examining the government that resulted from the American Revolution, begun in the same year, Chomsky finds that even James Madison, whom he calls as a great a believer in democracy as anyone then, wanted U.S. society controlled by \u201cthe wealthy\u201d\u2014property owners might be a better term\u2014which he thought was the most \u201cresponsible\u201d element of the citizenry. Thus was launched a never-ending battle between those desiring more democracy from below against those seeking more elite control from above. The ideas Chomsky presents are necessarily simplified for the sake of compression, and trying to summarize them briefly simplifies them even more. But their gist is clear and worth pondering. In post-World War II America, he suggests, there was a direct correlation between the average worker having a job that allowed him to own a home, support a family and educate his kids, on the one hand, and, on the other, the facts that the wealthy were taxed at a high rate, businesses were engaged mainly in making products designed to sell (which their workers could afford to buy), and the power of lobbyists and corporations in Washington was relatively limited. Advertisement The 1960s changed much of that. While the civil rights, antiwar and feminist movements transformed society with an upsurge of democratic activism from ordinary citizens, the powerful, alarmed at their loss of control, reacted with fierce efforts to consolidate and extend it. (Chomsky doesn\u2019t note how many non-elite Americans were also alarmed by the turmoil in the streets, though he does ponder the irony that Richard Nixon, who benefited from their reaction, was a raving progressive compared to those who came later.) The eventual consequence was a country that was like the \u201850s turned upside down: through deliberate efforts to undermine job security, the middle class was hollowed out both economically and psychologically; while less wealthy, post-WWII America was able to give free or low-cost college educations to most students, today\u2019s graduates are shackled with huge debts that help make them passive workers; corporations now devote far less energy to making products than to making money through moving it around, and protect their powers by, in effect, buying the kind of government that helps them maintain and increase that power. Chomsky aptly calls the process he describes a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d\u2014the more money that goes into politics with the intent of influencing it, the more our politics is ruled by money rather than any other definition of national welfare. The baneful effects of the Citizens United decision, which effectively removed all limits on how much money corporations can pour into elections, are noted, but Chomsky also blasts the influence of advertising culture as well as the modern media, which have helped turn citizens seeking useful information to make rational decisions into passive consumers, addicted to shopping, hypnotized by their devices and increasingly prone to making irrational, emotional decisions that are actually contrary to their own interests. The politics of image may be ubiquitous and inescapable now, but they are not for Chomsky. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with Sarah Palin about much,\u201d he says, before he shares her scorn for the \u201chopey, changey thing\u201d that many swayed voters two presidential elections back. It\u2019s a caveat that both sides might consider in 2016, even if the direness of Chomsky\u2019s analysis suggests that the real requiem he\u2019s offering is not for the American dream but for American self-government, a good idea while it lasted."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Rumba", "Review": "\"Rumba\" is a peculiar deadpan comedy from Belgium, sort of sweet, sort of macabre, about a couple who are out of step with life but not with each other. It\u2019s not terrifically funny, but then how could it be? The influence of Jacques Tati abides in the material, without his sunniness. Dom and Fiona (Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, who also co-wrote and co-directed the film with Bruno Romy) are schoolteachers and competitive rumba dancers \u2014 and dangerously out to lunch. Arriving at a dance contest, they realize they\u2019ve forgotten their costumes, race home to get them, and drive back at top speed while changing their clothes, Dom at one point upside down in the driver\u2019s seat while Fiona tugs at his socks. It\u2019s one time you\u2019re relieved to be able to see it\u2019s back projection. Advertisement Their luck worsens. Just for starters, they\u2019re in a car crash on their way home, and Dom loses his memory and Fiona her leg. This doesn\u2019t much depress them; they\u2019re loving and ebullient, and have each other. But then one catastrophe after another besets them, only one of which I will reveal. Abel and Gordon, I learn, have long worked together in cabaret, tilting toward physical comedy. They\u2019re essentially silent comedians with no need of a movie with a soundtrack, and \u201cRumba\u201d has a bare minimum of dialogue. They\u2019re skilled. A scene when Dom tries to rescue Fiona after a mishap with a trash fire reminded me of that Buster Keaton bit where he tries to help a drunken woman into her bed. The movie is pleasing and amusing. I think it\u2019s intended to be funnier, but it\u2019s too laid back to achieve take off. Yes, laid back, even after they burn the house down. Those damned wooden legs. Nothing but fire hazards."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Silent Souls", "Review": "Road movies take many forms, and \"Silent Souls\" is the road movie as metaphysical memory and meditation. This profound and immensely touching film in only 75 perfect minutes achieves the profundity of an epic. I read the description (two friends from the ancient Merjan tribe in Russia take a funeral trip involving the wife of one) and wasn't much interested; it sounded like ethnography without impact. Yet not often have I been more deeply touched. The film is narrated by a mill worker, Aist (Igor Sergeev). His friend and co-worker Miron (Yuriy Tsurilo) receives news that his much younger wife has died. There is a Merjan tradition, we learn, that when his wife dies, a husband asks his closest friend to join him in rituals surrounding this event. They set out together in Miron's car to drive to the deathbed in their distant town of Neya. Advertisement Joining them on the trip are two fluttery little birds, buntings, that Aist has just purchased at a market stall and is afraid to leave behind untended. These birds in their cage may represent souls trapped in bodies. Together, the two men undress Tanya (Yuliya Aug), the dead wife, bathe her, tenderly wrap her and place her in the back of their car. Aist's narration explains that water is of supreme importance to the Merjans, who were originally from Finland but long ago were absorbed by Russia. Only such rituals survive of their history. While the two friends take the body to a lake, they engage in a practice called \"Smoke.\" This means the husband is permitted, indeed expected, to share details frankly about his love life and his wife's sexuality. This in no sense is offensive; it is fond and loving. Miron's wedding night included a Merjan practice in which the bride's friends tied bright threads to her pubic hair, and later the husband must untie the threads and hang them over a branch of a yew tree. This is much more loving than the way certain European countries display with triumph a bloody sheet after a wedding night.  As it happens, Aist was also in love with Tanya, and we see some of his own memories. The movie contains very little onscreen dialogue between the two men, permits itself long shots of them simply driving, listens to their \"Smoke,\" and we learn that, as it happens, Aist was also in love with Tanya, and Miron knew that. In flashback we see some of their memories.  At the end, on a beach, the men build a bonfire, cremate Tanya and scatter her ashes on the water. (This appeals to me much more than being screwed into a casket.) The buntings all this time have been rather enervating with their (may I say) bird-brained chirps and incessant leaps around the perches in their little cage. Now they have their appointment with destiny. \"Silent Souls\" is fearlessly simple. In part, it is an act of mourning not simply for Tanya but for the traditions of the Merjan peoples and their lost villages. I was reminded of the books of W.G. Sebald, who undertakes journeys through the half-abandoned remainders of the past, through signs that men had once been here and are now forgotten. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Archaeology of a Woman", "Review": "Sally Kirkland has almost 200 credits on her IMDb page, and one of them is \u201cArchaeology of a Woman,\u201d which was made in 2012 but is only now getting a week-long release in New York. Kirkland plays Margaret, a former journalist who is starting to show the first signs of dementia. In the effectively disorienting opening scene, Margaret is slowly making her way around the parking lot of a store and trying to find her car. She is aware enough of her encroaching illness to have developed all kinds of coping strategies to get her out of tough situations, and so she approaches a police officer and cannily smiles and tries to charm him with a tale about having lost her keys. Then she sits there in the parking lot until the officers escort her home, where they find her car in the driveway. Advertisement How did Margaret get to the store? She doesn\u2019t know, and we don\u2019t find that out either. There are a lot of things we don\u2019t find out in this movie. Director-writer Sharon Greytak keeps us in the dark over plot points here, so that we are often just as confused as Margaret is, and this might work to the film\u2019s benefit if the plot gradually became known to us as Margaret slipped away from her own consciousness. Instead, \u201cArchaeology of a Woman\u201d doesn\u2019t build but lurches forward in awkward fits and starts until whatever we have invested in Margaret and her secrets starts to fade away. Margaret\u2019s daughter Kate (Victoria Clark) is called to deal with her mother\u2019s increasing fogginess. Kate is a chef (an ever-popular movie profession), and everything here that has to do with her character is absurdly unconvincing, particularly her unaccountable romance with a cop (Karl Geary) who takes a strange and instant interest in Margaret\u2019s welfare. Kate is given very random sexual scenes to play, and when she\u2019s at the restaurant where she works she says \u201cchef-like\u201d things like \u201cThat needs more tarragon\u201d to her underlings in the kitchen. Her whole subplot starts to make even less sense than Margaret\u2019s story, which begins to dissolve into a paranoid thriller as TV news reports about the remains of dead bodies seems to trigger something in Margaret\u2019s memory.\u00a0 If nothing else, this wobbly little movie offers Kirkland an opportunity for a fully lived-in performance, and she lets it all hang out, going topless at several points and keeping up a furious kind of intensity that suggests she has an inner monologue going for her character at all times. The strength of Kirkland\u2019s work here is its lightness, its vulnerability, its touches of the flirtatious and the comic. There is a pixie impishness to some of her performance that seems to spring from her own beginnings as a theater actress in the Greenwich Village of the 1960s, where anything and everything was allowed. Just because Margaret is ill doesn\u2019t mean that she is just a case study, and Kirkland insists on her humanness and her individuality, especially in a funny, disturbing scene where cops find her outside in her black slip and she insists on telling them all about her life, which hints that Margaret has a bit of an Andy Warhol superstar in her character. But the film lets Kirkland down because it asks her to play a few too many scenes where Margaret has a temper tantrum and yells at everyone around her. Such scenes make us less interested in whatever mystery may need to be resolved and more interested in having her confined so that she can get the care she needs and stop putting herself and others into harm\u2019s way. Kirkland does some fine work here, but her Margaret deserves a better script and a better movie.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Kick-Ass", "Review": "Shall I have feelings, or should I pretend to be cool? Will I seem hopelessly square if I find \u201cKick-Ass\u201d morally reprehensible and will I appear to have missed the point? Let's say you're a big fan of the original comic book, and you think the movie does it justice. You know what? You inhabit a world I am so very not interested in. A movie camera makes a record of whatever is placed in front of it, and in this case, it shows deadly carnage dished out by an 11-year-old girl, after which an adult man brutally hammers her to within an inch of her life. Blood everywhere. Now tell me all about the context. Advertisement The movie's premise is that ordinary people, including a high school kid, the 11-year-old and her father, try to become superheroes in order to punish evil men. The flaw in this premise is that the little girl does become a superhero. In one scene, she faces a hallway jammed with heavily armed gangsters and shoots, stabs and kicks them all to death, while flying through the air with such power, it's enough to make Jackie Chan take out an AARP membership.  This isn't comic violence. These men, and many others in the film, are really stone-cold dead. And the 11-year-old apparently experiences no emotions about this. Many children that age would be, I dunno, affected somehow, don't you think, after killing eight or 12 men who were trying to kill her? I know, I know. This is a satire. But a satire of what? The movie's rated R, which means in this case that it's doubly attractive to anyone under 17. I'm not too worried about 16-year-olds here. I'm thinking of 6-year-olds. There are characters here with walls covered in carefully mounted firearms, ranging from handguns through automatic weapons to bazookas. At the end, when the villain deliciously anticipates blowing a bullet hole in the child's head, he is prevented only because her friend, in the nick of time, shoots him with bazooka shell at 10-foot range and blows him through a skyscraper window and across several city blocks of sky in a projectile of blood, flame and smoke. As I often read on the Internet: Hahahahaha. The little girl is named Mindy (Chloe Grace Moretz). She adopts the persona of Hit Girl. She has been trained by her father, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), to join him in the battle against a crime boss (Mark Strong). Her training includes being shot at point-blank range while wearing a bulletproof vest. She also masters the martial arts \u2014 more, I would say, than any other movie martial artist of any age I can recall. She's gifted with deadly knife-throwing; a foot-long knife was presented to her by Dad as, I guess, a graduation present. Advertisement Big Daddy and Mindy never have a chat about, you know, stuff like how when you kill people, they are really dead. This movie regards human beings like video-game targets. Kill one, and you score. They're dead, you win. When kids in the age range of this movie's home video audience are shooting one another every day in America, that kind of stops being funny. Hit Girl teams up with Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), the film's narrator, a lackluster high school kid who lives vicariously through comic books. For reasons tedious to explain, he orders a masked costume by mail order and sets about trying to behave as a superhero, which doesn't work out well. He lacks the training of a Big Daddy. But as he and Hit Girl find themselves fighting side by side, he turns into a quick learner. Also, you don't need to be great at hand-to-hand combat if you can just shoot people dead. The early scenes give promise of an entirely different comedy. Aaron Johnson has a certain anti-charm, his problems in high school are engaging, and so on. A little later, I reflected that possibly only Nic Cage could seem to shoot a small girl point-blank and make it, well, funny. Say what you will about her character, but Chloe Grace Moretz has presence and appeal. Then the movie moved into dark, dark territory, and I grew sad."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Thank You for Your Service", "Review": "\"Thank You For Your Service,\" about Iraq War veterans\u00a0adapting to civilian life,\u00a0is a film that teaches you how to watch it. Adapted and directed by Jason Hall (\"American Sniper\")\u00a0from\u00a0a same-titled nonfiction book\u00a0by David Finkel, this a major studio movie from Universal Pictures.\u00a0But it has been written,\u00a0shot, edited and acted in such an\u00a0intimate and unobtrusive way that the result feels like a throwback to an earlier era of American mainstream\u00a0filmmaking, when it was still possible to base a handsomely produced\u00a0feature film\u00a0around observed behavior, and not feel obligated to safeguard against viewer\u00a0boredom by shoehorning\u00a0extra melodrama or contrived genre-movie elements into the mix. Its slightly raggedy rhythms are unusual for a film made on this scale. If the central question occupying your mind as you watch\u00a0a movie is \"Where are they going with this?\", you might hate it. I'll admit that I kept my arms folded for the first 30 minutes. Then something clicked for me\u2014I don't recall exactly what\u2014and suddenly I was entranced by how different it felt from the usual, and engrossed by the characters and their problems.\u00a0 Advertisement The main story concerns a group of combat veterans and their partners, all of whom are\u00a0connected to agonizing battlefield events that will be detailed in due course. There's\u00a0Sergeant Adam Schumann (Miles Teller), a rock of decency whose willingness to shoulder other peoples' burdens ultimately starts to feel like a form of emotional retreat. There's\u00a0Tausolo Aieti (Beulah Koale), an American Samoan who credits the military with saving his life, and\u00a0Will Waller (Joe Cole), who returns home to find that his fiancee has left him and taken their daughter with her, and James Doster (Brad Beyer), who died in Iraq and is portrayed in flashbacks and through other people's anecdotes. As in \"The Best Years of Our Lives,\" the lives of the soldiers' mates are central to the story:\u00a0Saskia Schumann (Hayley Bennett) is as loyal to her husband as he is to his former\u00a0platoon-mates, while the late James Doster's wife Amanda (Amy Schumer, in a rare and effective dramatic turn), stays connected to her friends while struggling\u00a0to find out exactly what happened to her husband.\u00a0 Every soldier is suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of one kind or another. Their partners and children absorb their pain by osmosis when they aren't physically shielding themselves against it. Sometimes the PTSD manifests itself in sleeplessness, nightmares and sudden outbursts of resentment\u00a0or violence. Other times it takes on a physical aspect\u2014especially for Tausolo, who survived a bomb blast from an Improvised Explosive Device and now suffers memory dropouts that resemble early onset Alzheimers' disease. Even Adam, who presents himself as an avatar of Tom Hanks-like, even-tempered niceness, is a smiling\u00a0thundercloud of mixed emotions and mostly unexpressed\u00a0anxiety.\u00a0 For the most part, though, the characters' PTSD isn't expressed in a cliched way.\u00a0There's a bit of combat action at the beginning and end of the movie, and snippets of Iraq\u00a0flashback strewn throughout, and there are a couple of\u00a0moments where characters seem as if they're about become involved in violent crime, which is how a lot of these films about returning veterans have traditionally justified their commercial existence\u00a0(the '70s and '80s were filled with movies about Vietnam veterans, many of them cynical pretexts for revenge-driven mayhem).\u00a0But these are uncharacteristic interludes that total\u00a0maybe five percent of the movie's running time.\u00a0Hall and his collaborators treat them mainly\u00a0as sources of information about the characters: what they've been through, what they're capable of, what their limits are. It's all\u00a0a far cry from \"American Sniper,\" an action film/black comedy that alternated brain-splattering urban shootouts with low-key moments of domestic strife.\u00a0What's most important at any given moment here\u00a0isn't what's happening at the level of plot, but how the characters feel about whatever they're going through, and how the trauma they've experienced affects their perceptions.\u00a0 Advertisement Much of the movie simply shows the characters talking to each other about the war and life after the war, and about their families and obligations and hopes for the future. Hall's script is filled with jocular, often casually profane dialogue that captures the way real men and women speak to each other during private\u00a0moments. There are scenes that feel too loose or fragmented for their own good, and moments early on when the lead performances seem too casual;\u00a0but as the tale unfolds we start to appreciate the actors' pretense of\u00a0naturalism as well as the director's refusal to frame any shots in conventionally polished ways (the compositions are intelligent and occasionally expressive,\u00a0but very rarely pretty).\u00a0At its best, the movie evokes fond memories of four of the best scripted features\u00a0about U.S.\u00a0veterans made within the mainstream\u00a0system, \"The Best Years of Our Lives,\" \"The Deer Hunter,\"\u00a0\"Coming Home\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July.\" Teller's performance as Schumann is easily his best work since\u00a0\"The Spectacular Now,\" and nearly everyone else in the cast\u00a0matches or exceeds him in intelligence and judgment. But\u00a0the breakout star here is\u00a0Koale, a New Zealand-born actor of Samoan descent who has never had a lead role in a major film before. His disarmingly understated performance is so bereft of the usual\u00a0actorly tricks that there are times when the film's dramatic architecture seems to vanish, leaving you feeling as if you're watching a fly-on-the-wall documentary about a young man who just got back from war. He's extraordinary. \"Thank You For Your Service\"\u00a0is also, in its way, a political film, though not in a tedious left wing/right wing sense. The causes of\u00a0the Iraq War and its ultimate historical significance\u00a0are not Hall's concern, but at the same time, the film avoids lapsing into the cliche of \"The only thing that matters in war is the soldier next to you,\" perhaps recognizing it as a means of avoiding political reality. In its own quiet, even sneaky way, however, this is an angry film. It\u00a0directs its anger at a country which, ever\u00a0since the military and humanitarian disaster\u00a0of Vietnam and the end of the active draft,\u00a0has subcontracted war to lower middle class and poor people (and\u00a0mercenaries),\u00a0then allowed politicians to keep them mostly out of sight and mind after they've endured and committed unimaginable violence. Veterans are treated as human props in this country, posed in front of flags and trotted out at sporting events and momentarily flattered by politicians of both parties, even as legislators and presidents neglect their care or gut their benefits, and large sections of the public forget they even exist. The phrase that serves as the film's title is often the only gesture of gratitude that veterans receive from people who don't know them personally. There's no meaningful support\u00a0network for people like Adam and\u00a0Tausolo. They walk through the film's alternately crowded and desolate panoramas like invisible men, ghosts among the living.\u00a0 Advertisement The most painful scenes in the film show Adam,\u00a0Tausolo and their colleagues running a gauntlet of\u00a0bureaucracy trying to get treatment for mental or physical problems. There are no \"bad guys\" in any of these scenes, no snide or hateful rotten apples standing in larger, faceless institutions. The people who work for the Veterans Administration are well aware of how little power they have to improve veterans' lives, and there are times when they seem apologetic and frustrated that they can't do more. When Adam and Tausolo drink in bars or\u00a0sit in crowded waiting rooms outside government offices waiting for their numbers to be called, the movie keeps cutting to shots  of\u00a0 veterans whose bodies have been devastated by combat: a man with a prosthetic leg, a man emptying a catheter bag, a one-armed soldier in uniform momentarily putting down his beer so that he can shake another man's hand.\u00a0The tone of these scenes is not cynical, merely exhausted, and somehow this makes them even more devastating.\u00a0If\u00a0\"nobody\" is at fault, it means that we all are."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Duchess", "Review": "Much is made in Britain of the fact that Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire (1757-1806) was the great-great-great-great-aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales. I wouldn't know where to start in counting my own great-great-great-great-aunts, but the Brits have an obsession with genealogy, and then too both women married men who were fabulously wealthy, had several enormous houses and kept mistresses, and both women had lovers. The difference is, Georgiana was more interesting. She was married off by her mother at 16 to William Cavendish, the fifth Duke of Devonshire, a man who loved his dogs more than her. She was treated like chattel, valued only for her breeding ability, raped by the duke at least once, and became the most famous woman in England, save for Queen Charlotte, whose husband was merely mad. Georgiana was an outspoken liberal, a supporter of the American and French revolutions, a campaigner for one Whig prime minister (Charles Fox) and the lover of another (Charles Grey, whose daughter she bore). She was a feminist who dared to speak publicly on politics, although she accepted that women did not have the vote. Advertisement \"The Duchess\" is a handsome historical film, impeccably mounted, gowned, wigged and feathered, where a husband and wife spend hours being dressed in order to appear at dinner to argue about whether the mutton is off. With Keira Knightley playing the duchess and Ralph Fiennes playing her husband, such a conversation is a minefield. The man has no conversation, addresses her primarily to issue instructions and is obsessed with the production of a male heir, who would have much to inherit, including the grandest private house in London, and Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, the favorite of all British country houses. (I have visited Chatsworth and I was in awe. At today's prices, not even Bill Gates could live like the Devonshires.) For a woman to be the duchess of such a private kingdom, to be immersed in politics, to be a beauty, a wit, a fashion leader and a feisty scrapper with an appetite for better sex than the duke provisioned, Georgiana must have been extraordinary. I am not sure \"The Duchess\" quite does her justice. Yes, her marital views were flexible. She disliked but tacitly accepted the duke's numerous adulteries. She made only one close female friend, Lady Elizabeth Foster (Hayley Atwell), and the duke rogered her, too. Georgiana was enraged not only because of his infidelity, but for being robbed of her friend. Later they made up, and she accepted Bess and her three sons into their household, referring to William as \"our husband.\" There was a reason for Bess' betrayal, and it wasn't lust. Her cruel husband had banned her from ever seeing her sons again, and William was powerful enough to reunite her with them. Later, he is quite prepared to prevent Georgiana from ever seeing their four children. Women had no rights even to their offspring. The Whigs, although behind the curve, were clearly the party of the future; the Tories supported the status quo. The duke, duchess and even Lady Elizabeth are capable of behaving according to the rules governing their class in even the most inflammatory situations. They often act as if onstage, and they are. When Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling), Georgiana's mother, says her affair with Grey is the talk of London, why should she be surprised? Every conversation in this film takes place in the presence of at least two servants. Advertisement I deeply enjoyed the film, but then I am an Anglophile. I imagine the behavior of the characters will seem exceedingly odd to some viewers. Well, it is. William is a right proper bastard without normal feelings -- a monster. How do you make love with the fifth Duke of Devonshire? You close your eyes and think of the sixth Duke of Devonshire. Georgiana puts up with more than we can imagine. When we see her tender and playful in the company of Earl Grey, it is a refreshing change. We do not see William and Bess bedding each other, and just as well. We hear them. This is not one of those delightful movies based on a Jane Austen novel. It is about hard realists, constrained in a stifling system and using whatever weapons they can command. It is rather fascinating on that level, although I would have loved to learn more about what the Whigs at that formal dinner really thought about Charles Fox's vision of the rights of man and the abolition of the slave trade. Note: Yes, the famous tea is named after Earl Grey. It is my second favorite, after Lapsang Souchong, which has an aroma stirring nostalgia for fresh tar in autumn."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Newlyweeds", "Review": "\"Newlyweeds\" is a film out of its time. Will audiences have the patience for it\u2014or even know how to watch it? I hope so, because it's a special movie. Odd, disjointed and not entirely coherent, but special.\u00a0 You could describe it as an indie drama about a furniture repo man named Lyle (Amari Cheatom) and a museum tour guide named Nina (Trae Harris), and how their pot dependence bonds them to each other but keeps them from advancing in life. You could also compare it to Spike Lee's \"She's Gotta Have It,\" not just because it concentrates on a predominantly African-American slice of Brooklyn's single community, but because writer-director Shaka King, like Lee before him, has the eye of a poet but the sensibilities of a journalist and seems content to leave it at that. He doesn't seem too interested in telling a neatly interwoven story in which one thing leads to another, and it all builds to a neat, satisfying conclusion.\u00a0 Advertisement But in a film about stoners, a certain feeling of inertia might be inevitable, and \"Newlyweeds\" embraces it. It's expertly written, directed, shot, acted and edited, and even though it wears out its welcome about halfway through, there's always something fascinating to look at or listen to, plus a sense of promise that lends the whole project more goodwill than it might otherwise inspire.\u00a0 This is a film of vignettes, many of which feel as self-contained as shorts or sketch comedy bits. Lyle and his partner Jackie (Tone Tank) devise convoluted schemes to repossess a couch or a refrigerator and carry them out with the \"Seriously, like that would actually work?\" bravado of 1970s TV cops playing dress-up. At one point Lyle poses as a guy who could be an Afrocentric jazz philosopher, his obviously phony beard and mustache dangling from his face like curtain fringe. Lyle and Nina smoke and smoke and smoke as they talk about the present and future of their relationship, including the trips they may never take together (\"How we supposed to go to the Galapagos if you're buying a bag every two minutes?\" she asks him). There are effective slapstick set pieces: Nina being mortifyingly careless with a bag of pot brownies; an exasperated, weed-craving Lyle wandering the neighborhood for bud and being mistaken for a crackhead, and a mordantly funny jail cell scene that evokes the counterculture-infused comedies of Robert Downey, Sr. and the early underground comix of R. Crumb.\u00a0 There's a story, or an implied story, or maybe a psychological condition holding everything together, sort of: Lyle and Nina can't recognize or admit how much time, money and emotion they're investing in their drug of choice, and how it encourages them to mistake contemplation for introspection. Marijuana frees the imagination, but the roaming mind doesn't always travel to new or useful places. A lot of the time it just indulges in mental masturbation, some of it colorful and entertaining (Lyle's Blaxploitation fantasy, for example), the rest pointless or debilitating. One of the most unnerving scenes finds Lyle hate-staring at Nina, who has let a talkative, insistent yet oddly ingratiating coworker named Chico (Colman Domingo) come home with her and share some potent hash. The movie fixates on the two as seen by the stoned, jealous Lyle: the mix of slow-motion, hellish red lighting and bizarrely elongated expressions makes it seem as though their faces are morphing into African masks, like one that Nina wears for Lyle earlier in the film.\u00a0 This is a movie about stoners rather than a stoner movie. It's not \"Smiley Face\" or a Harold and Kumar comedy and isn't trying to be. It has surreal or dark passages, and a mature attitude toward the main couple's drug use that somehow never becomes moralistic.\u00a0 But overall, the tone is light and playful. \"Newlyweeds\" is less a grand statement than a playground for its talented performers and filmmakers, including the great character actor Isaiah Whitlock, Jr., who has a sidesplitting cameo as a jailhouse joker, and cinematographer Daniel Patterson, whose elegant but unfussy lighting and elaborately choreographed Steadicam shots contribute to the aura of confidence. King has a good ear as well as a sharp eye. The people in this film don't all talk the same way, and the best dialogue seems eavesdropped on. (\"This buddy of mine, this little Inuit dude, he was four feet tall,\" Chico tells Nina. \"He wrestled an elk.\") \"Newlyweeds\" is a likable collection of bits that don't really lead anywhere, but the people who made it are going places.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Princess Cyd", "Review": "An extended scene about halfway through Stephen Cone's \"Princess Cyd\" is a perfect illustration of what he does so well as a director. A group of friends gather twice a month to eat, drink, and read excerpts of literature to one another. Everyone comes with something prepared. One person reads the famous final pages of James Joyce's The Dead. An old woman reads Emily Dickinson's poem starting with the line \"There's a certain Slant of light.\" Excerpts from James Baldwin, Thoreau ... In the room is a palpable space of intent group focus, the scene perfectly evoking the pleasure of the ritual for everyone involved. Advertisement Cone captures the atmosphere of groups, and groups in particular contexts, the fluctuating alchemy of messy collectives. His gift with ensembles puts him in rare company with directors like Jonathan Demme and Jean Renoir, directors comfortable with sprawl, \"mess\", letting things develop as they come. Cone treats each moment with patience\u2014stepping back, allowing it to breathe, find itself. The actors in his films\u2014not just in \"Princess Cyd\" but his previous features (\"The Wise Kids\" and \"Henry Gamble's Birthday Party\")\u2014make us believe these people have known one another forever. Whereas in \"The Wise Kids\" and \"Henry Gamble,\" the ensemble is the star, \"Princess Cyd\" features a main character as the focal point, a strong, freckled, teenage girl named Cyd (short for Cydney), who goes to stay with her aunt Miranda (Rebecca Spence) for three weeks. Miranda, a famous author, still lives in the Chicago home where she and her sister (Cyd's mother, now dead) grew up. Why Miranda hasn't been a part of Cyd's life at all isn't revealed until near the end of the film, but it's a a buzzing subtext. Teenagers are often shoehorned into types by lazy screenwriters, unimaginative directors, etc. It's easier, I guess, to use shorthand: jock = jerk, pretty girl = mean, bookworm = nerd. Cyd, though, is a mixed bag. She plays soccer at school, she is unselfconscious about her body, she's curious about some things, totally indifferent about others. \"I don't read,\" she informs her literary aunt, who struggles to maintain a neutral expression in the face of such a shocking admission. Cyd is not neurotic about what she wants (witness her behavior at the tail-end of the literary reading party), but there's a blankness there somewhere, a lack of continuity with her past, dating from her mother's death. She barges into the carefully constructed world of her more reserved aunt, asking abrupt questions, sometimes as a rude interruption. Miranda fields Cyd's bull-in-a-china-shop questions gamely, but it's awkward. How on earth is she supposed to relate to this bouncing blonde athlete who isn't even embarrassed that she doesn't read? Advertisement On the first day of Cyd's visit, she goes into a coffee shop and makes eye contact with an androgynous fluffy-Mohawked barista named Katie (Malic White). Whatever Cyd sees goes to her core, there's a pheromonal chemistry-click, seemingly reciprocal. Cyd has a boyfriend back home, but is blase about it when he's mentioned. With Katie, though, the confident Cyd disintegrates into a helpless girl with a crush. The two start hanging out, and it's clearly the beginning stages of a courtship. Cone treads lightly here. He is interested in the feeling\u00a0of things, the impressionistic aspect of love and attraction: hair and sunlight and laughter, the vertigo of butterflies in the stomach. His style is gentle and unobtrusive. Cyd hasn't been with a girl before, but she doesn't question her attraction. One of the things \"Princess Cyd\" does really well is gently allow for the space that opens up between people\u2014and in that space everything is okay. Love isn't just neurosis. Love is also comfort and belonging. Cyd doesn't need to change herself to be \"worthy\" of anyone. Maybe this space between people\u2014the same space in the group literary-reading scene\u2014is love. Letting others contribute to you, listening to others, not just focusing on what you will say next. Perhaps to those more accustomed to the peaks and valleys of plot/conflict/climax, \"Princess Cyd\" will seem too leisurely. But its leisurely quality\u2014its disinterest in \"pumping\" things up, its focus on the small yet vivid spaces of listening, understanding, struggle, identity\u2014is its greatest asset. The scenes between Cyd and Miranda play out on a parallel track to Cyd and Katie's relationship. The aunt-niece dynamic very well could have followed the cliched rule book: Boisterous Cyd teaches repressed Miranda to loosen up, and bookworm Miranda teaches Cyd to appreciate the written word! While some of these elements do show up, Cone resits putting the characters into a simplistic dialectic. Neither needs to become more like the other in order to be a \"well-rounded\" person. (\"Well-rounded\" people don't make interesting dramatic characters anyway.) For Cone, no one point of view is prioritized. (This was what was so amazing about \"Henry Gamble's Birthday Party,\" featuring a much larger ensemble.) Miranda wrestles with her reactions to some of Cyd's behavior and there's one extraordinary scene where she calls her niece out for making a rude comment. This is a woman whose wifi password is \"Hawthorne1850\" (1850 being the year of the publication of \"The Scarlet Letter\"). Writing Miranda off as a spinster who needs to get laid is deeply disrespectful, and Miranda asserts her own equally valid Self in reaction. There are all kinds of ways to find pleasure in life. Sex is only one of them. You don't realize how positional most films are, how they push audiences to think a certain way about characters/story/conflict, until you see a film like \"Princess Cyd,\" until you see how Cone presents his characters and then steps back, allowing them to work it out for themselves. Advertisement There are conflicts in \"Princess Cyd,\" but they're on a low boil. One of the pluses of Cone's approach\u2014if you're open to it\u2014is you are sometimes confronted with your own preconceived notions about people. You may look at Miranda, and think immediately, \"Oh, okay, I know who that woman is.\" You would be wrong. The same for Cyd. \"Oh, okay. Bored teenager sunbathing in a bikini. I know who that is.\" Again, you would be wrong. There's a great line in Philip Barry's \"Philadelphia Story\", where Tracy Lord, who has lived her life in imperious judgment of others, finally \"gets it,\" and says to her cynical friend: \"The time to make up your mind about people ... is never.\" What a concept. It's not easy, what Stephen Cone does. If it were easy, we'd see it more often."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Circle", "Review": "The highlight of \"The Circle\" is producer-costar Tom Hanks' performance as the CEO of the titular company, a Google- or Apple-styled high-tech octopus that's spreading its tentacles into every nook of our lives. The brilliance of Hanks' performance as Eamon Bailey, founder of The Circle, is that it's not remarkably different from the humble, charming average guy performance he gives as himself whenever he goes on talk shows, accepts awards, or narrates a documentary about the unsung heroes of World War II. For whatever reason, you can't help trusting Tom Hanks. That's why \"The Simpsons Movie\" cast him in a voice cameo selling \"The New Grand Canyon,\" a name for the hole that would have been left in the ground if the military went through with its plan to bomb the recently contaminated town of Springfield into oblivion. \"Hello, I'm Tom Hanks,\" he says. \"The US government has lost its credibility, so it's borrowing some of mine.\"  Advertisement The notion that Tom Hanks, a patriotic emblem right up there with apple pie and the American flag, would be hired to put a smiley face on an American Hiroshima is scarier than a lot of current horror films. You just know that if he ever used his considerable influence for evil rather than good, almost no one would resist him, and the handful that warned against him would not be believed. And yet Hanks has never played a straight-up bad guy who chills you to the bone whenever he shows up onscreen. The closest he's gotten to that sort of character was in \"The Road to Perdition,\" where he played a mob hitman who was more of a morose antihero than a bad guy, and the \"The Ladykillers,\" a slapstick comedy that cast him as an obnoxious, bumbling Satan with a Foghorn Leghorn accent. His performance in \"The Circle\" as Evil Tom Hanks is the best thing in the picture.  That isn't saying much. James Ponsoldt's film based on Dave Eggers' same-titled 2013 book has a lot of good ideas and a few engrossing sequences, but it never quite finds a groove, or even a mode, and it ends in an abrupt, unsatisfying way. Emma Watson stars as Mae Holland, a young woman who gets a job at The Circle, a cult-like corporation based in the Bay Area that has a campus with man-made lakes and a sky filled with buzzing drones.  You probably have a good idea of where this story is going even if you've never read Eggers' book or seen an anti-tech warning tale before. Mae is handpicked by Eamon and his right-hand man, company co-founder Tom Stenton (Patton Oswalt), to take part in an experiment to glorify a new tiny camera they've invented. She'll wear cameras on herself and plant them all over her apartment and in other significant locations of her life and embrace the idea of \"total transparency\" hyped by her boss. \"Transparency\" and \"integration\" and other multi-syllable words get tossed around a lot by guys like Eamon, who are really interested in getting access to our data so they can monitor our lives, sell us new products, and resell our information to third parties. \"The Circle\" gets this and uses it to generate low-level paranoia in every scene, and amps it up whenever Eamon strides onstage to give one of his TED-talk styled addresses to the company or to unveil a groundbreaking new product (such as the tiny spherical cameras that Eamon distributes all over the world, giving the resultant Orwellian surveillance network a granola-crunching progressive label: SeeChange). The problem is, \"The Circle\" never finds a good way to escalate its paranoia in anything other than a tedious, obvious way. And the meat-and-potatoes manner in which Ponsoldt has adapted and directed this material reveals the limits of his talent. A mad visionary stylist who paints with light and sound might've made a memorable film out of this story, but that's not the kind of director Ponsoldt is. He thrives\u00a0in a low-key mode, telling stories of ordinary people interacting in ordinary spaces; \"Off the Black,\" \"Smashed\" and especially \"The Spectacular Now\" were about as good as intimate character-driven indies could be, and \"The End of the Tour\" had its moments, too. There's a Hanks-like decency to the way he looks at human beings.\u00a0 Advertisement But this story doesn't have many recognizable human beings in it. They're mostly plot functions with names. Watson's character is The Heroine, really more of a Gullible Ingenue. Glenne Headley and the late Bill Paxton are The Parents (Paxton shakes visibly because his character has multiple sclerosis). Hanks is the Villain, even though he doesn't play him that way, and Oswalt's character is the Scary Right Hand Man, sizing up Mae and pushing her back onto the beaten path whenever she's about to stray. Ellar Coltrane of \"Boyhood\" plays her ex-boyfriend Mercer, who warns her that The Circle is evil and that she's selling her privacy and her soul. Karen Gillan is The Friend who hires Mae to work for The Circle, only to become jealous and irritated when the founder selects Mae as the company's poster girl, then worried when the extent of Eamon's exploitation becomes apparent. What I'm describing here is the cast of a horror movie that traffics in archetypal situations, one in which the characters don't have to be plausible human beings to rivet our attention and merit our sympathy. David Cronenberg and David Lynch, both of whom might've done a brilliant job with this same material, are aces at making films fueled by dream logic and filled with archetypal characters and images. (Just imagine what either of them could do with Oswalt, a reliably excellent comic character actor who unexpectedly radiates power and menace here.) Ponsoldt does not appear, on the basis of this film, to be that sort of director, and that sort of director is what \"The Circle\" needed. This movie might represent the least sensible match of filmmaker and material since Sidney Lumet adapted \"The Wiz.\" As you watch the film, the subdued performances, realistic-looking locations and active-but-not-baroque camerawork make you expect a more realistic film about tech, along the lines of \"The Social Network\" or \"Steve Jobs.\" When the story turns into something akin to a nightmarish cousin of \"The Truman Show\" or \"Network,\" or the kid sister of Cronenbeg's \"ExistenZ,\" you want it to get bigger, wilder, more outrageous, more frightening, and it's too nice and reasonable and conscientious to do that. The result feels undernourished in just about every way, although Hanks's performance, John Boyega's brief role as a founding programmer, and a couple of frightening action sequences break through the tedium. This is one of those movies that has nothing and everything wrong with it. It's frustrating in a singular way.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Neighbors", "Review": "Here is the thing about \"Neighbors,\" a hard-R hybrid of \"Animal House\" and a sort-of sequel to \"Knocked Up\" in which a Gen X couple with an infant daughter and a hefty mortgage declares war on the rowdy Gen Y frat boys who move in next door: You will laugh. Maybe not nearly as much as during \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" or \"Superbad\" but there is a steady stream of inducements to at least chuckle with regularity. Most of these lewd dollops of humor rely on what we will refer to (as a matter of decorum) as \u201cRichard\u201d jokes, ranging from artisanal dildos to the miracle of an instant erection.  Advertisement You may even applaud, as my audience did, when Rose Byrne\u2014as mother and wife Kelly, who desperately needs a night out and is shockingly adept at\r\n cursing\u2014proves her comedic prowess in \"Bridesmaids\" was no fluke. With almost scary zeal, she summons her fulsome wiles to seduce both a girl and a guy into hooking up after lubricating their libidos with several rounds of shots. \r\n You will also groan at some of the more inappropriate moments, such as \r\nthe unfortunate use of the \u201cN\u201d word as well as an ill-advised joke about\r\n baby HIV. Also annoying is the lack of any fully developed women beyond\r\n Byrne and Lisa Kudrow as a fed-up college dean. The female students \r\nfluttering by all seem to dress as if they were in a Victoria\u2019s Secret \r\nfashion show. And note to the two male screenwriters, Andrew J. Cohen \r\nand Brendan O\u2019Brien: Breast-feeding is not as amusing as you think it \r\nis. As\r\n for the plot, it\u2019s a grass-is-always-greener scenario\u2014but with plenty\r\n of weed, too. The twist is, both sides want what the other one has. For\r\n cubicle drone Mac (Seth Rogen), it\u2019s a chance to revisit his \r\nresponsibility-free past. For party major Teddy (Zac Efron), it\u2019s a \r\npossible future beyond hot-tub bacchanals and hazing underclassmen. \r\nThey are less foils and more fun-house reflections of one another, and \r\nthat is rather deep for this kind of id-driven tomfoolery.  Much\r\n like Nicholas Stoller\u2019s previous directorial efforts, \"Forgetting Sarah \r\nMarshall\" and \"Get Him to the Greek,\" \"Neighbors\" is messily pasted together \r\nwith improvised bits and plot threads that dangle. I miss the days when\r\n comedy scripts were lovingly honed, with dialogue that sang not \r\nstuttered. But at least Stoller manages to avoid many of the clich\u00e9s of \r\nthe raunchy bromance genre. Still, it makes no sense that no one else on\r\n the block complains that the Greeks blare music and set off fireworks \r\nat all hours.\u00a0  But\r\n what is most surprising about this latest effort from graduates of the \r\nJudd Apatow Clown Academy for Emotionally Stunted Males is that Efron \r\ngives his most mature and nuanced post-\"High School Musical\" performance \r\nyet as the alpha stud of Delta Psi. Not that his character is one \r\nnote. Instead, like a latter-day Eddie Haskell but with killer abs, he \r\neasily slips from sincere and reassuring to sneaky and underhanded when \r\ncounter-attacks are called for. You actually feel his regret when it \r\nfinally dawns on him that maybe he should have gone to class once in a \r\nwhile.\u00a0  Advertisement Meanwhile,\r\n Rogen\u2014a producer along with his usual cohort, Evan Goldberg\u2014has \r\ndevolved back into his standard pothead schlub routine after taking a \r\nstretch with more dramatic work in \"Take This Waltz\" and \"50/50\" as well as \r\nplaying straight man to Barbra Streisand in \"The Guilt Trip.\" The problem \r\nis \"Neighbors\" will likely gross more at the box office than all those \r\nthree films combined. Who would have predicted that Jonah Hill\u2014the \r\nBoo-Boo to Rogen\u2019s Yogi Bear\u2014would be the one to end up with two Oscar\r\n nominations? A\r\n sub-strata of fresh faces provides able support, including Dave Franco \r\n(younger brother of James) as Pete, Teddy\u2019s sharper second-in-command; \r\nCraig Roberts (\"Submarine\") as a frat recruit known as Assjuice; and \r\nstandup comic Hannibal Buress as a laid back police officer. And how long\r\n can Christopher Mintz-Plasse get away with a resume full of variations \r\non his McLovin character? But\r\n no one holds the screen like Mac and Kelly\u2019s big-eyed darling of a \r\ndaughter, played by twins Elise and Zoey Vargas. Universal, the studio \r\nbehind \"Neighbors,\" may want to consider putting her outtakes online \r\njudging by the chorus of \u201cawws\u201d heard whenever she shows up.  A\r\n coda before the end credits that finds Mac and Teddy connecting \r\nshirtlessly outside an Abercrombie & Fitch provides welcome closure.\r\n Be forewarned, however: If this movie becomes popular, car airbags are\r\n destined to become the new whoopee cushions."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Bachelor Weekend", "Review": "John Butler\u2019s \"The Bachelor Weekend\" is a genial comedy with likable enough characters to get one through its modest running time and meager intentions but it succumbs to a few too many clich\u00e9s and paper-thin characterizations to fulfill its potential. Worst of all, it allows one larger-than-life character to steal too much focus and drag the narrative into a predictable arc we've seen so many times before: the boorish lout who breaks the more docile types out of their shells. There are emotional moments that are surprisingly effective (mostly thanks to the talents \"Sherlock\" star Andrew Scott), a few good laughs, and hints at the film that could have been with just a few rewrites. It\u2019s not quite a \"lost\" weekend, merely misplaced. Advertisement More accurately known as \"The Stag\" overseas, \"The Bachelor Weekend\" stars Hugh O\u2019Conor as Fionnan, the kind of sensitive groom-to-be who makes dioramas of his reception and serves as the main contact for the event\u2019s florist. Even the wedding planner calls him metrosexual. His fianc\u00e9e Ruth (Amy Huberman) asks Best Man Davin (Andrew Scott, Moriarty from \"Sherlock\") to organize a \"stag.\" Fionnan, Davin, and their best friends will hike the great outdoors, getting in touch with nature and themselves. Travelers include Fionnan\u2019s brother \"Little Kevin\" (Michael Legge), Kevin\u2019s partner \"Big Kevin\" (Andrew Bennett), and friend Simon (Brian Gleeson). Of course, they all have a bit of drama to explore on their journey. Kevin\u2019s father refuses to attend Fionnan's wedding if his son\u2019s partner is there. And Simon is undergoing serious financial difficulties that have plunged him into depression. While you might think there\u2019s enough movie there, Butler throws a powder keg into the campfire by introducing \"The Machine\" (Peter McDonald), Ruth\u2019s obnoxious, loud, possibly crazy brother. The Machine forces his way on the stag, despite having nothing in common with Fionnan and his mates. He threatens to destroy the whole adventure (and, for a time, the whole movie). Of course, anyone who\u2019s ever seen a film can tell you that there\u2019s more to The Machine than he lets on and that he\u2019ll help pull these gentlemen out of their shells whether they want to step out or not. There are times when Butler\u2019s sweet, character-driven comedy works, such as an argument about U2 in which The Machine literally can\u2019t believe that there\u2019s an Irishman who didn\u2019t cry at their concert, a very funny bit about how Davin feels that Fionnan only likes things after he does so first, and a musical interlude around the bonfire. \"The Bachelor Weekend\" is a screenwriting tug-of-war. Every moment that feels character-driven is off-set by one that feels forced. If McDonald isn\u2019t pushing the overbearing Machine routine (which, to be fair, isn\u2019t the actor\u2019s fault but Butler\u2019s script), the characters are going through too many predictable revelatory moments, especially in the last half-hour (the treacly piano keys kick in at almost exactly the hour mark). \"The Bachelor Weekend\" is at its best not in its scenes of men acting like children or the beats that feel more written than organic but in its most believable scenes of joyful, male friendship in between the broad humor and melodrama. I just wish there were more of them. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Hours", "Review": "In the days after the horrific car crash that took Paul Walker's life on Nov. 30, many tributes were paid to the handsome 40-year-old actor best known for his undercover lawman in the \"Fast & Furious\" movies. He was a great dad to his teen daughter. He was given to generous acts of charity, once secretly purchasing a pricey engagement ring for an Iraq war vet and his fianc\u00e9e. He was a capable action hero, and his likability factor onscreen and off was through the roof.\u00a0What you didn't hear, however, was much effusive praise of his acting talent.  Advertisement That may change once \"Hours,\" the first of his two finished movies, arrives in theaters and on VOD this weekend. Set in a New Orleans hospital during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the thriller isn't perfect, the budget deficiencies are apparent, and Walker is pretty much forced to carry the entire weight of the drama on his well-muscled shoulders.  That's not surprising, considering he is the only recognizable cast member, and his main co-star ends up being a newborn infant. What is unexpected is how well he pulls off what is essentially a one-man show.  Once the story gets going after a rather clumsy and protracted opening, screenwriter Eric Heisserer (\"Final Destination 5\"), in his directing debut, allows Walker plenty of room to more than rise to the occasion. The film ends up being a rather ingenious survival tale crossed with a tension-ratcheting gimmick\u2014somewhat akin to \"Speed\"'s bomb-on-a bus scenario\u2014that makes every ticking minute count.  First, however, we must patiently learn all the details of the situation. When we first meet his character Nolan Hayes, his pregnant wife Abigail (Genesis Rodriguez)\u00a0has gone into labor five weeks early. Nolan rushes her to the hospital just as the historic storm starts brewing. The tragic news that his wife has died leaves Nolan more numb than tearful, but at least their daughter is alive. However, a doctor explains the preemie must be fed through an IV and placed in a ventilator, remaining there for at least 48 hours.  However, once Katrina unleashes her wrath and the flood waters rapidly rise (clips of actual newscasts keep us up to date), the hospital is forced to evacuate. That leaves Nolan and his child on their own since the ventilator can't be moved. Then the power cuts out, the back-up generator fails and Walker's character spends the rest of the film cranking a battery that can only be recharged for a couple minutes at a time.  Much like Sandra Bullock in \"Gravity\" or Tom Hanks in \"Cast Away,\" Walker's Nolan finds surprisingly engaging if compelling ways to pass the time. He speaks to his silent daughter, telling her about her mother while pulling out photos and other souvenirs\u2014including her engagement and wedding rings, taken off in a rush before going into the delivery room\u2014and placing them atop the ventilator. He hunts down refill bags for the IV drip, changes a diaper for the first time, seeks out a radio transmitter after cell service goes out, remembers how he and his wife met and fell in love, and rushes to the rooftop and back after failing to flag down a helicopter. Matters grow more dire when men with guns start lurking in the darkened hallways, scavenging for food, drugs and whatever they need to get by.  Advertisement And, all the while, he must continue to return to crank that battery. Again and again and again.  His pretty face obscured by a beard and his considerable physicality tested, Walker manages to be both tender and tough, and to watch him stretch himself so well is a pleasure. It's much like watching the late James Gandolfini up-end his menacing image with his sweet portrayal of a lovable lug in \"Enough Said.\" It's a sad experience knowing he is no longer around, but also happy, since he left behind one more memorable performance. Heisserer doesn't get everything right, but he sure knows how to milk a taut ending, including a miraculous final shot, one that would have drawn tears even if Walker were still around. For those who wish to see the actor at his best, \"Hours\" is worth the time."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Last Chance Harvey", "Review": "\"Last Chance Harvey\" is a tremendously appealing love story surrounded by a movie not worthy of it. For Dustin Hoffman, after years of character roles (however good) and dubbing the voices of animated animals, it provides a rare chance to play ... an ordinary guy. For Emma Thompson, there is an opportunity to use her gifts for tact and insecurity. For both, their roles project warmth and need. When \"Last Chance Harvey\" gets out of their way and leaves them alone to relate with each other, it's sort of magical. Then the lumber of the plot apparatus is trundled on, and we wish it were a piece for two players. One subplot, scored with funny-bumpy-scary music, is entirely unnecessary. And even with the two stars onscreen, there is too much reliance on that ancient standby, the Semi-Obligatory Lyrical Interlude. Advertisement But what's good is very good. Hoffman plays Harvey, a failed jazz pianist who has found success writing jingles for TV ads. Thompson plays Kate, an airport interviewer for a British agency. Harvey flies to London to attend his daughter's wedding, and in the space of 24 hours he learns that he has been fired and that his daughter would prefer her stepfather gave her away. At the same time, Kate is ignored on a blind date and has to deal with a mother who fears her new neighbor is a vivisectionist. They met briefly when Harvey was rude to Kate at the airport. The next day, when both are deep in misery, they find themselves the only two people in a pub. Harvey recognizes her, apologizes and, out of desperation, tries to start a conversation. She resists. But notice the tentative dialogue that slowly allows them to start talking easily. It's not forced. It depends on his charm and her kindness. Pitch perfect. But then the dialogue fades down, and the camera pulls back and shows them talking and smiling freely, and the music gets happier, and there is a montage showing them walking about London with lots and lots of scenery in the frame. The movie indulges the Semi-OLI more than once; it uses the device as shorthand for scenes that should be fully transcribed. In \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset,\" Richard Linklater sent Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy talking all through a night in Vienna and all through a day in Paris, and never let them stop, and kept his camera close. Why didn't Joel Hopkins, the writer-director of \"Last Chance Harvey,\" try the same? He had the right actors. Hopkins gets one thing right. They stay outdoors. Going to his hotel or her flat would set the stage for body language neither one is ready for. They avoid the issue by walking around London, although unfortunately Hopkins sends them mostly up and down the Victoria Embankment and the South Bank, so he can hold the Thames vista in the background. We get more montages of them walking and talking, as substitutes for listening to a conversation we've become invested in. One subplot works well. After Kate starts Harvey talking about why his relationship with his daughter failed, she tells him he must attend her wedding reception. He says she must go with him. He will buy her a dress. There is a gratuitous and offensive montage of her trying on dresses, including one frilly gown that looks perfect for a fancy dress ball in \"Gone With the Wind.\" Not only is this montage an exhausted cliche, they're in a hurry, remember? But when they get to the reception, Harvey is touching in a carefully worded speech. Advertisement The subplot that doesn't work involves Kate's mother (Eileen Atkins). She peers through her curtains at her suspicious neighbor, thinks she sees him carrying a body to the woodshed and speed-dials her daughter every five minutes. Every time we cut to her, we get that peppy suspense music, as the movie confuses itself with light comedy. \"Last Chance Harvey\" has everything it needs but won't stop there. It needs the nerve to push all the way. It is a pleasure to look upon the faces of Hoffman and Thompson, so pleasant, so real. Their dialogue together finds the right notes for crossing an emotional minefield. They never descend into tear-jerking or cuteness. They are all grown up and don't trust love nearly as much as straight talk. Hopkins deserves credit for creating these characters. Then he should have stood back and let them keep right on talking. Their pillow talk would have been spellbinding."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Shotgun Stories", "Review": "Jeff Nichols' \"Shotgun Stories\" is shaped and told like a revenge tragedy, but it offers an unexpected choice: The hero of the film does not believe the future is doomed by the past. If it were, most of the key characters would be dead by the end, an outcome that seems almost inevitable. Here is a tense and sorrowful film where common sense struggles with blood lust. The movie takes place in a \"dead-ass town\" where three brothers exist. \"Hang out\" is the only word for what they do. They were named Son, Kid and Boy by an alcoholic father and, in Son's words, \"a hateful woman.\" Son (Michael Shannon) sprinkles the feed at a local fish farm and loses all his money trying to perfect a \"system\" he thinks can beat the local casino. His wife has just walked out, taking their son. His brother Kid (Barlow Jacobs) would like to get married, but \"I worry about taking care of her. I mean, I don't have a truck. I don't have a house. I sleep in a damn tent.\" The youngest, Boy (Douglas Ligon), lives in his van and is struggling to beat the heat by persuading a home air-conditioner to run off his cigarette lighter. Advertisement If this sounds like the setup for a redneck joke, it isn't. The brothers are quiet, lonely, still suffering from abusive childhoods. And consider the remarkable scene where their mother knocks on the door to tell them their father, now married to another woman and with four more sons, has died. \"When's the funeral?\" Son asks. \"You can find out in the newspaper.\" \"You going?\" \"No.\" Son, Kid and Boy attend. After abandoning them, their father sobered up in rehab, found Jesus and started a prosperous middle-class family. Now Son chooses to say a few words over the coffin before spitting on it, and a fight breaks out. This fight will escalate into a blood feud in which lives are lost, blood is shed and yet the enemies are so unprepared that after one buys a shotgun in a pawn shop, he has to be shown how to assemble and load it. The film is by no means entirely grim and implacable. There are moments of quiet humor, as when Boy finally figures out a way to run the air-conditioner off his car battery and rigs it to blow at him on a riverbank, and to run a blender for his margaritas. Annie (Glenda Pannell) is fed up with Son's gambling habit but is a gentle woman who loves him. Son himself has hopes for his own son and wants to break the cycle of violence. So does the oldest son of the other family, although the dead father seems to have done a better job of bringing up those boys than the first three. Writer-director Jeff Nichols is working in the same world where David Gordon Green sets his films; indeed, Green is a co-producer of this film, which uses his cinematographer, Adam Stone. The photography is wide-screen; these people live surrounded by distant horizons, the vista broken only by the occasional tree or broken-down tractor. Like Green, Nichols uses sleight-of-hand to sneak in plot details; \"Shotgun Stories\" has the most subtle dialogue I can imagine to reveal, by implication, that Boy has, or had, an African-American wife or girlfriend. Advertisement This film has literally been saved by the festival circuit. After being rejected by major distributors, it found a home in smaller festivals, where word of mouth propelled it into its current wider release. It has qualities that may not come out in a trailer or in an ad but sink in when you have the experience of seeing it. Few films are so observant about how we relate with one another. Few are as sympathetic. \"Shotgun Stories\" is as spare as the landscape. Classical drama comes condensed to a harshness: \"You raised us to hate those boys, and we do. And now it's come to this.\" In a movie where so much violence obviously occurs, we see very little of it. Nichols sidesteps the problem of the intrinsic interest of violence by looking away from it and focusing on its effect. We don't get to know the second family very well, but Son, Kid and Boy are closed up within their melancholy. Although some orange flowers and gentle music try to do their work at the end, we can only hope Son finds the life he desires for his own son. \"Shotgun Stories\" was a selection of Ebertfest 2008."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "World's Greatest Dad", "Review": "Bobcat Goldthwait makes a daring assault in \"World's Greatest Dad\" against our yearning to mythologize the dead. But he loses his nerve just before the earth is completely scorched. I have a notion his first draft screenplay might have been unremittingly dark and cynical. It might not have been \"commercial.\" This version may have a better chance. Audiences think they like bleak pessimism, but they expect the plane to pull out of its dive and land safely. Robin Williams is the star, demonstrating once again that he's sometimes better in drama than comedy. He has that manic side he indulges, and he works better (for me, anyway) when he's grounded. Here he plays Lance, a high school teacher, the divorced father of a loathsome teenager. His son dies by hanging and becomes the object of a cult of veneration and mourning at the school where he was a student and his dad still teaches. Advertisement This premise is well-established because of a disturbingly good performance by Daryl Sabara as Kyle, the disgusting son. Kyle is a compulsive masturbator who makes no effort to conceal his pastime from his father. At school, he's a vulgar sexist, insulting girls in the corridors. At all times he is as angry and hostile as he can possibly be, and is genuinely disliked by the student body -- with the sad exception of Andrew (Evan Martin), his \"friend\" and victim. Lance comes home to find his son has strangled himself. He has loved the boy despite everything, and now he attempts to rewrite the story of his death. He manufactures misleading evidence for the police to find -- and although he is a failed author with five rejected novels in the drawer, he now finds his perfect genre by forging a diary allegedly left behind by Kyle at his death. This diary he posts on the Internet, it goes viral at the high school, and the student body is overtaken with remorse about the way Kyle was treated. Soon he becomes the deity of a death cult, led no doubt by \"Twilight\" fans, and students start wearing his photo. Lance is now seen as a heroic father. The way this becomes an obsession is possibly the real point of Goldthwait's film. There's nothing like death to stir the herd instinct. For example, yes, Michael Jackson was a creative and talented artist. But was he as venerated a week before his death as he was a week after? Would anyone have foreseen the state funeral? What exactly did it mean when fans staged an all-night vigil at Neverland? Some were motivated by grief, more perhaps by a desire to participate vicariously in fame. Like sports fanatics, they seek identities through the objects of their adulation. The Kyle cult becomes a tiger that Lance, the hero's father, has to ride. As he passes through the corridors, the path clears before him and a hush falls. He becomes much more interesting to his girlfriend Claire (Alexie Gilmore), a fellow teacher, who had shown alarming signs of growing sweet on Mike (Henry Simmons), a handsome, younger faculty member. The only character who doubts the story about Kyle's death and his diary is Andrew -- the only one who knew him, and his onanism, at all well. Lance otherwise triumphs as he creates a fake son in place of his real son, and it all leads up to Kyle Clayton Day at the school. It is quite true, as New York Times critic Stephen Holden points out, that the phony death story has brought out the better natures of the survivors. My question is whether Goldthwait, the creator, after all, of \"Shakes the Clown,\" started out with that intention. There is an inexorably black satire somewhere inside \"World's Greatest Dad,\" signaling to be saved. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Like Someone in Love", "Review": "There is a shot about a third of the way through \"Like Someone in Love\" of a pretty, perky young lady emerging from an apartment bathroom a different woman. Her hair no longer tied up in a bun but falling wide at her shoulders, her feet bare, her legs no longer moving with girlish timidity but easing along in languid strides that show off their shapeliness. She moves down the hallway to the bedroom, turned away from the camera as the rustle of her simple dress fills the silence. An invitation. The effect is nearly as jaw-dropping as the helicopter attack in \"Apocalypse Now,\" a quiet demonstration of shock and awe. She's in the apartment of an elderly professor, and he wasn't expecting this. How did writer-director Abbas Kiarostami choose to convey this moment of attempted seduction? A tracking shot behind the woman's swaying hips? A slow pan up the curve of her calves as she slinks away? A panicked handheld shot of the professor reacting to this provocation? No, he just offers a steady view of her trip to the bedroom, letting the moment breathe softly into our ears. An Iranian, Kiarostami has learned from the restrictions his government imposed upon filmmakers how to convey sensuality and smoldering inner life in ways that would force a censor to confess to having a filthy mind. Advertisement Unlike many of his Iranian peers, Kiarostami didn't encounter much censorship during production of classics like \"Close-Up\" and \"Taste of Cherry\" but simply found some of his films banned. He once analyzed the situation: \"I think they don't understand my films and so prevent them being shown just in case there is a message they don't want to get out.\" That was when Kiarostami was still working in Iran. He started making films a decade before the Iranian Revolution but stayed for decades after many colleagues fled the authoritarian regime. His rationale was that not remaining rooted in one place would have an effect on his filmmaking like constantly uprooting and replanting a tree would have on its fruit. After directing nearly 50 \"rooted\" films, he's now roaming the earth. His 2010 masterpiece, \"Certified Copy,\" was shot in Italy and this one takes place in Japan. Yet the tight formal control and discretion remain. These strange new entries in an already strange and unpredictable filmography are the harvest of 40 years. The befuddled but wise professor in \"Like Someone in Love\" struck me as a Kiarostami avatar, dispensing his wisdom to the young call girl/college student who ends up in his apartment by happenstance \u2014 which, typical of Kiarostami, is the result of many offscreen events that our imaginations must provide. (And if you're looking for a plot description right about now: sorry, friend. There is something like a plot unfolding in this film, but it's best discovered cold.)  The filmmaker is interested, as ever, in shape-shifting roles, surfaces and relationships, but Takashi (Tadashi Okuno), the acclaimed professor who finds himself caught in the middle of a young couple's turmoil, sounds a lot like the somewhat conservative and male chauvinist Kiarostami, who once told an interviewer that men are work-oriented whereas women are affection-oriented; that \"marriage is essential for all women.\" (Kiarostami condemns one character who failed in life's marriage sweepstakes by framing her in a claustrophobic window sill that might as well be at Tochigi prison.) The director who usually seems stoic because of his ubiquitous aviator shades, but actually wears them because of sensitivity to light, likewise keeps a tidy frame with precise, geometric arrangements and movements but is quite tender when relating a moment of affection or protectiveness. As with other great directors who understand the power of the frame, the former quality supports the latter. When the would-be seductress Akikio (Rin Takanshi) first explores Takashi's apartment, Kiarostami pans along at her pace, allowing us a tour of his bursting bookshelves and papers piled everywhere. Takashi's life story is told through carefully placed family photos and artworks.  Advertisement Later, we learn that the professor has assumed the role of the call girl's \"father\" with almost desperate passion \u2014 not from histrionics or speeches but through revealing, repetitive actions. Messages on his antiquated answering machine let us infer that he's breaking a longstanding orderly routine to become this girl's protector. He ignores all business calls the instant he learns she's in trouble, and gets to his feet with as much vigor as an often desk-bound 80-year-old can muster. All of which might sound pretty slight, but Kiarostami's eye and ear render it all in an intriguingly odd, often absurd light. So many of his long-take compositions could stand up to hours of museum scrutiny, which is not surprising for a commercial-illustrator-turned-director who has been experimenting with ways to suggest as many possibilities in a single (sometimes rock solid, sometimes constantly shifting) frame as possible since 1970.  Many critics have noted the wondrously jam-packed and disorienting opening shot inside a nightclub, but every shot in the film, really, is its own universe. Window panes and mirrors often relieve Kiarostami from cutting to and fro by including an offscreen character in a gorgeously warped, faded reflection. His joy in discovering a shimmering new canvas, the city of Tokyo, comes through in each cut to something quietly astonishing. It helps that sound designer Mohammad Reza Delpak makes such an enveloping \"score\" out of Tokyo's ambient urban cacophony. Some critics who saw the film at Cannes last year had trouble with how abruptly and weirdly it ends. I'm semi-spoiling it for you now so that maybe you'll make less of it. The characters in \"Like Someone in Love\" are not very strong-willed or dynamic. The promise of income and social advancement in a ruthless economy lure them to adopt roles that fit them uncomfortably, which further prompts them to take on other roles that help conceal their shame and vulnerability. Kiarostami presents indefinite people with indefinite motivations and desires. The way this film ends is perfect, I've decided (after wrestling with it for a few weeks) because it's a bracing slap to the face of not just these characters who have been slumming, pretending and withholding, but to many of us who might be going through life on some kind of autopilot. The film's craziest, most easily mocked character emerges as the one most fully alive. Old Kiarostami, master of paradoxes, is set in his ways, but his ways are never set. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Quitters", "Review": "It's not fun following teenage kid Clark (Ben Konigsberg) around for an hour and a half. Clark is the lead character in Noah Pritzker's debut feature \"Quitters\" (Pritzker co-wrote the script with Ben Tarnoff), and he is manipulative, passive-aggressive, and a user with zero sense of humor. Teenagers are often annoying, of course. And teenage angst and peer pressure and the newness of some experiences make them all act a little nuts. But Clark is a horse of a different color. Konigsberg, to his credit, does not soft-pedal any of Clark's personality flaws, a remarkable accomplishment for such a young actor. But, still, \"Quitters\" is a challenging and joyless experience. The title of the film is accurate. Everyone here quits: on themselves, on situations, doing drugs, staying in relationships. Considering his selfish parents, it's no wonder Clark has made an art out of bailing (often with great cruelty) when things get tough. Advertisement Clark's mother (Mira Sorvino) is in rehab for prescription-pill addiction. (\"Technically, your mother's not an addict. She has a 'dependency,'\", says Clark's weak stoner dad, played by Greg Germann). Clark has a crush on a classmate named Etta (Kara Hayward), and when she rebuffs his advances, he responds by dropping her as a friend via vicious condescending email, and then spreading rumors around school that she struggles with depression. Clark cannot stand his father, whom he treats with contemptuous superiority. Clark decides to quit his own awful family and become part of another. Crashing in the home of friend Natalia (Morgan Turner), he worms his way into the family's routines and, in a particularly bleak scene,\u00a0into Natalia's bed. Saffron Burrows and Scott Lawrence play the parents who welcome Clark into their home without once calling Clark's dad to see if it's okay. (It calls to mind that funny line from \"While You Were Sleeping\": \u201cLucy, you are born into a family. You do not join them like the Marines.\u201d)\u00a0 To be fair, \"Quitters\" does not plead with us to sympathize with Clark. Pritzker and Tarnoff present him in a very straightforward way, showing us what he does, how he does it and his emotional brutality. \"Quitters\" also does not turn him into a case study (his mother has a \"dependency\" and his dad's a loser, and that's why he's this way!) Clark is smart, but he is also lazy. He goes for what he wants, whether it's a condom he steals out of Natalia's mom's drawer, or challenging his teacher Mr. Becker (Kieran Culkin) to give him a better grade. Sorvino is great in the small role of Clark's tear-stained, checked-out mother, calling and texting him desperately from rehab, but detached from any sense of real responsibility. Kieran Culkin is equal parts disturbing and endearing as the schlubby Mr. Becker, such a different role than the one he just played in Todd Solondz's \"Wiener-Dog.\" Mr. Becker works on a novel in his off-hours, and seems like a big clueless kid himself, hanging out by the microwave, staring at it as it heats up his pizza. He's tough on his students, but he's weak too. You can practically see the broken dreams scattered around his feet shuffling down the hallway. Advertisement At a certain point, a pretty basic thought comes up: What exactly is the story being told here? The pedestrian style does not help. The scenes look like they're from a 1980s TV movie, with little to no imagination or tension in the editing or angles. A beautiful piano theme by David Shire is yearning, nostalgic, sweet, all qualities which do not enter into \"Quitter\"'s emotional landscape at all. Fictional characters, even leads, don't need to be \"relatable\" or likable. They don't even need to be sympathetic. What they need to be is watchable, which Konigsberg is. Watching him operate (he doesn't do it by stealth, he comes right out with it), is fascinating in a creepy way. He takes what he wants, walks away without blinking, and has no compunction about re-approaching people he's hurt if he then needs something from them. His rear view mirror is filled with burned bridges already. He's a sociopath in training. Very few actors can be both opaque and revealing at the same time. Alain Delon can do it, but that's a pretty high bar. Konigsberg struggles a little bit in that department. There are times when the camera lingers on his face, and there is nothing going on; it is impossible to tell what he's thinking. And it's impossible to tell if that's the point. It may very well be. The teenage discontent and rage plus Clark's runaway status calls to mind Holden Caulfield in \"Catcher in the Rye,\" but the comparison falls apart on closer examination. Holden had a sense of humor as well as at least being capable of intimate relationships with both of his siblings, dead and alive. Clark, following the example of his wretched parents, is already way beyond that. The more apt comparison would be Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley from her famous \"Ripley\" novels (Alain Delon, incidentally, in all his gorgeous chilly cunning, played Tom Ripley in \"Purple\u00a0Noon.\") Clark isn't as bad as Tom Ripley. Yet. Maybe he'll turn out okay. I doubt it, but maybe. Maybe he's just surrounded by\u00a0quitters, and he senses it, and he hates it. The film doesn't say."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Me and You", "Review": "If the intimate Italian drama \u201cMe and You\u201d came from an\r\nunknown director rather than Bernardo Bertolucci, one of cinema\u2019s modern\r\nmasters, would it be seeing U.S. distribution? Probably not. With interest in\r\nsubtitled films in a state of sad and seemingly endless decline, this tale of a\r\nboy and his half-sister who hole up in their father\u2019s basement to escape the\r\nworld might well feel too slight and marginal to attract the attention of\r\nart-house distributors. But rather than suggesting why slight and marginal works\r\nmight as well be avoided, the film points up the continuing benefits of an\r\nauteurist approach to cinema. Bertolucci is indeed a master, and \u201cMe and\r\nYou\u201d evidences numerous thematic connections to his earlier work as well as\r\nconstant proof of his distinctive gifts as a stylist. While it may not have the\r\ntransformative originality of \u201cThe Conformist\u201d and \u201cLast Tango in Paris\u201d or the\r\nepic scale of \u201c1900\u201d and \u201cThe Last Emperor,\u201d its pleasures are sufficient to\r\nfully reward the attentions of Bertolucci admirers\u2014and perhaps even draw some\r\nnew fans. Advertisement Since serious back problems have rendered him unable to\r\nstand, Bertolucci has not released a film in nearly a decade. He might never\r\nhave worked again, he has said, had he not discovered ways to direct from a\r\nwheelchair and found a subject in Niccolo Ammaniti\u2019s novella amenable to his\r\nlack of mobility. For these reasons, and the fact that he hadn\u2019t made a film in\r\nItalian in 30 years, \u201cMe and You\u201d has an air of renewal and understated\r\nebullience that is one of its chief attractions. In its early sections, the film\u2019s story focuses on Lorenzo\r\n(Jacopo Olmo Antinori), a 14-year-old with a mop of tousled brown hair, a\r\npimply and usually sullen face, and the first fuzzy hints of a moustache. The\r\npicture of contemporary adolescent alienation, the kid has a therapist who\r\nthinks he\u2019s making headway, though it\u2019s clear Lorenzo finds school a huge drag\r\nand home even worse. His dad buys him expensive gifts but is present only on\r\nthe phone. His mother (Sonia Bergmasco), an attractive blonde, takes him out to\r\nan expensive restaurant, where he annoys her by asking if she would make love\r\nwith him if they were the last two people left on earth\u2014a droll flashback to\r\nthe incest theme of Bertolucci\u2019s \u201cLuna.\u201d The kid\u2019s only happy relationship is with his aged\r\ngrandmother (Veronica Lazar), but she seems to be in her final days. When he\r\nhalf-jokes that he wants his coffin placed on top of hers, it gets at what he\u2019s\r\nreally after: total isolation. And he has a plan for that. When vacation rolls\r\nup and his mother drives him to the bus for a school skiing trip, he starts an\r\nargument that ends with her ejecting him from the car. He then returns to the\r\nold building where his family lives and secretes himself in the cellar, where\r\nhe has constructed a hideaway that promises him a week in blissful solitude,\r\nlistening to music on his headphones and fooling his parents with occasional\r\nphone calls.  But the idyll is almost immediately interrupted by the\r\narrival of Olivia (Tea Falco), his older half-sister by a previous marriage of\r\nhis father. She is 25 and model-beautiful but jittery and erratic in her\r\nactions. It\u2019s clear that relations between the two have never been very good;\r\nthere are resentments and grievances on both sides. His main wish, though, is\r\nsimply to get rid of her, and at first he succeeds. She goes away, but then\r\nreturns and threatens to scream loud enough to give away his ruse unless she\r\ngives her shelter. And it\u2019s then that he learns sis has a particularly\r\nself-indulgent kind of sickness\u2014she\u2019s a junkie. Advertisement For over half of its length, the action in \u201cMe and You\u201d is\r\nconfined to the basement where Lorenzo and Olivia hide out, and it\u2019s almost as\r\nif Bertolucci chose to approach this as an interesting formal challenge: how to\r\ncreate an enclosed and claustrophobic situation that\u2019s never static or boring.\r\nHe and cinematographer Fabio Cianchetti accomplish this with constant changes\r\nin lighting and visual angles and Bertolucci\u2019s trademark lexicon of varied and\r\nelegant camera movements. This is all not only subtly beautiful in itself, it\u2019s\r\nalso thematically and psychologically apposite: Because the outside world feels\r\nso oppressive and threatening to Lorenzo and Olivia, it makes sense that this\r\nplace of confinement would feel hospitable, strangely inviting, even\r\nliberating. It is a place, too, where they are able to find a kind of\r\nsolidarity in their troubles, and perhaps even begin to see beyond them. Those\r\nfamiliar with Bertolucci\u2019s work might expect that the attractive characters and\r\nclose quarters here could point toward an erotic destination, as did similar\r\nsituations in films ranging from \u201cLast Tango\u201d to \u201cThe Dreamers.\u201d But Bertolucci\r\nis never one to remain stuck in the past. Here eros, the urge toward\r\ntranscendence, is not sexual but psychological. It\u2019s a matter of pushing past\r\nboundaries and finding healing in difficulty and self-renewal\u2014much as this\r\ngreat director did in making \u201cMe and You.\u201d"}

It\u2019s set in Washington, D.C., in the 1930s when Japan and the United States still had diplomatic relations, and the target is a red cipher machine.  Something happened to Lt. F. Ellis Coburn (Lee Perkins) in Tokyo seven years earlier to turn him into the man we see. He looks to be a flawlessly turned-out Navy officer, but he\u2019s locked behind a stone face and a reputation all his superiors know about. In a climate of expanding promotions as the Navy prepares for war, everyone notices he\u2019s stuck at lieutenant. Advertisement Eddie Doyle (Donal Thoms-Cappello) is a cocky young thief straight from a 1930s pulp crime magazine. He approaches his craft as a science, noiselessly breaking and entering, breaking combinations, slipping into the night. He can pick locks and pockets, and works within a tight criminal fraternity ruled by Stella Snyder (Maureen Byrnes), a wise-talking hard-core case. Navy intelligence has broken all the Japanese codes but this one. The Red Machine baffles them. They assign Coburn to the task because of his undoubted skills and get Eddie released from jail for his particular specialty. Eddie will get them into the guarded embassy, and when Coburn sees the machine, he\u2019ll know what he\u2019s looking at. The machine itself can\u2019t be stolen; the Japanese must never suspect it has been compromised. The drama also involves the Japanese ambassador Shimada (Eddie Lee) and his wife Naomi (Madoka Kasahara), who, almost inevitably, have links to the mysterious events in Tokyo seven years ago. And that\u2019s about it. These people, this stage, the red machine.  The movie, written and directed by the married pair of Stephanie Argy and Alec Boehm, doesn\u2019t fall back on stunts, chases or extended gun battles; it\u2019s in the honorable tradition of the heist movie. That involves blueprints, plans and the need to be very, very quiet. There\u2019s a nice scene when a safe is opened just behind an open door in Shimada\u2019s office. Coburn becomes so desperate to stall that he plays every card in his hand, including personal secrets. \u201cThe Red Machine\u201d is deeper than it first seems. The plot has hidden levels, and so do the characters, particularly the unlikely team of Doyle and Coburn. They don\u2019t like each other and don\u2019t like working together, and any possible personal progress is shut down by Coburn\u2019s fearsome reserve. He is taciturn to the point of aggression. Neither actor overplays. Perkins\u2019 role doesn\u2019t allow him. Thoms-Cappello\u2019s thief is supposed to be brash and dubious, which he is, but within reason. There\u2019s some subtle shifting going on that the directors suggest with visuals, not dialogue; an unspoken agreement to conspire takes place below the surface. Here\u2019s a film with an elegant simplicity. Not a shot doesn\u2019t do its work. It may remind you of a \u201940s B crime movie, and I mean that as a compliment. When you don\u2019t have a lot of explosions and special effects to exploit, you have to turn to the imagination \u2014 yours, and the audience\u2019s. Advertisement"}

She also learns to love her dad, played by Greg Kinnear,\r\nwhose aura suggests a man easier to love than, say, Steve Buscemi. She does\r\nthis on an idyllic island paradise off Savannah, Georgia, where her dad is a\r\nclassical composer whose pastime is restoring stained-glass windows. Advertisement I was trying to remember the last time I felt the way about a\r\ngirl that Miley Cyrus's fans feel about her. That would have been in 1959, when\r\nI saw Hayley Mills in \"Tiger Bay.\" Oh, she was something. A brave\r\ntomboy. She was 12, but I could wait. It's a bit much to ask for the same\r\ninnocence from Miley, who has already had her first World Tour, but the fact\r\nis, she does a good job of making her character Ronnie engaging and lovable.\r\nThat's despite her early Alienated Teen scenes. You know it's an Alienated Teen\r\nwhen it's a lovely day on an island paradise, but she has her hands pulled up\r\ninside the sleeves of her sweater and huddles against the chill of the cold,\r\ncruel world. I\r\nlike Miley Cyrus. I like her in spite of the fact that she's been packaged\r\nwithin an inch of her life. I look forward to the day when she squirms loose\r\nfrom her handlers and records an album of classic songs, performed with the\r\nsame sincerity as her godmother, Dolly Parton. I think it'll be a long, long\r\ntime until she plays a movie character like the free-standing, engaging\r\nheroines of Ashley Judd, but I can wait. \"The\r\nLast Song\" is about how Ronnie (Miley) and her little brother Jonah (Bobby\r\nColeman) are taken by their mother (Kelly Preston) to spend the summer with\r\ntheir dad Steve (Kinnear). She blames her dad for the divorce, is sullen and\r\nwithdrawn.

Gradually she overcomes her hostility\r\nto Men and realizes Will is a nice and honorable kid, even though he lives in a\r\nvast Southern mansion with insufferable rich parents. Ronnie\r\nand Will make an attractive couple, possibly because Miley is standing on a box\r\nbelow camera range. I suspect Hemsworth may have been cast for his appeal to\r\nfangirls, rather like Robert Pattinson in \"Twilight.\" He's a little\r\ntoo tall, blonde, blue-eyed and hunky to be super plausible. He can definitely\r\nbecome a star, but it may be in the Peter O'Toole tradition; I can more easily\r\nimagine him in a remake of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" than as a settled\r\nspouse in a domestic drama. Miley\r\nCyrus, on the other hand, is attractive in the way of a girl you might actually\r\nmeet. Her acting is unaffected, she can play serious, and she works easily with\r\na pro like Kinnear, whose light comedy skills are considerable and undervalued.\r\nShe even seems sincere in the face of a plot so blatantly contrived it seems\r\nlike an after-school special. Would you believe that she and Will bond over sea\r\nturtle eggs? Advertisement Yes,\r\nshe scares off a raccoon trying to raid a nest of eggs buried in the sand, and\r\nmounts an all-night vigil over them. Then she calls the aquarium, and who do\r\nyou think is the handsome volunteer who responds to the call? Standing watch\r\ntogether the second night, Ronnie and Will start talking, and it's only a\r\nmatter of time until they regard together the itty bitty turtles hurrying\r\ntoward the sea. The\r\nother big crisis of her summer is that she' a trained classical pianist, but\r\nhas just turned down a scholarship to Juilliard because her dad, you see, is\r\nsuch a snake. In a world containing divorce, what's the use of Mozart? The\r\nfilm's title relates to this situation, I believe, in some obscure way. Miley\r\ndoes, however, sing in the movie. She's mad at her dad, but not her fans. \"The\r\nLast Song\" is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, who also\u00a0wrote\r\nthe screenplay. Sparks recently went on record as saying he is a greater\r\nnovelist than Cormac McCarthy. This is true in the same sense that I am a\r\nbetter novelist than William Shakespeare. Sparks also said his novels are like\r\nGreek Tragedies. This may actually be true. I can't check it out because,\r\ntragically, no really bad Greek tragedies have survived. His story here amounts\r\nto soft porn for teenage girls, which the acting and the abilities of director\r\nJulie Anne Robinson have promoted over its pay scale. The\r\nmovie is intended, of course, for Miley Cyrus admirers, and truth compels me to\r\nreport that on that basis alone, it would get four stars. But we cannot all be\r\nMiley Cyrus fans, and these days you rarely hear Hayley Mills mentioned. Yet I\r\naward the film two and a half stars. To\r\nbe sure, I resent the sacrilege Nicholas Sparks commits by mentioning himself\r\nin the same sentence as Cormac McCarthy. I would not even allow him to say\r\n\"Hello, bookstore? This is Nicholas Sparks. Could you send over the new\r\nCormac McCarthy novel?\" He should show respect by ordering anonymously.\r\nBut it seems unfair to penalize Miley Cyrus fans, Miley herself, and the next\r\nPeter O'Toole for the transgressions of a lesser artist.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Boulevard", "Review": "In \u201cBoulevard,\u201d the late Robin Williams\r\nplays a man with a secret. His character, Nolan, has muted this piece of his\r\nlife for over a half-century, as assisted by suburban monotony and a peaceful\r\nmarriage. His cubicle at the bank boxes him in during the day. At night, his\r\nwife (Kathy Baker) has a peaceful distance from his personal life, as they\r\nsleep in separate bedrooms. Even his best friend, Winston (Bob Odenkirk), seems\r\nto be a good one, but not someone that pays close enough attention to truly\r\nunderstand his friend's life. Advertisement \"Boulevard\" is a movie about choosing truth,\r\nregardless of how many years may have been lost to a lie. The catalyst for\r\nNolan's choice is his father's cardiac arrest. After leaving the hospital,\r\nNolan drives down a shadier street of town, and picks up a young male\r\nprostitute named Leo (Roberto Aguire). They go to a motel, but Nolan isn't\r\npaying for anything sexual; he just wants to talk, to interact with someone\r\nthat might listen.  The two continue to see each other, of which Nolan is insistent\r\nupon paying for his time. Nolan isn\u2019t\r\nclear about his intentions, which alarms Leo, but he isn\u2019t\r\nmalicious about them. Talking to Leo makes Nolan happy, as does the idea of\r\ntaking care of him. Nolan wants a true connection with a human being. As Nolan\r\nspends more time sneaking out to see Leo, the charade of his public life begins\r\nto unravel.\r\n\r\n Williams and director Dito Montiel are in tune with a pervading\r\nsense of tenderness, as the movie distinctly ruminates on connection, not love.\r\nWriter Douglas Soesbe does something that's nothing short of miraculous with\r\nthe presentation of its secret, by stripping it of its sensationalism, and\r\nshowing how big a deal it is despite the smallness of Nolan's character. The\r\ndialogue within Nolan's moments of accepting himself provides for revelatory\r\nscenes, especially the spacious conversation between him and his wife, as she\r\nexpresses her awareness of the situation, but her own resistance to see it\r\nchange. Montiel's usual dramatic instincts, to go big and brash, are aptly\r\nmuffled for the most part, except for the couple moments of false intensity\r\ninvolving Leo's abusive pimp Eddie (Giles Matthey). With dramatic scripts, Williams was a hushed force that offered\r\nsomething painfully human, and a talent who would go to the darkest depths with\r\ndirectors who had the right story (ex. Bobcat Goldthwait\u2019s\r\n\"World's Greatest Dad,\" the definitive Williams role in the 2000s).\r\nThe ingredient he brings most to \"Boulevard\" is heartfelt empathy,\r\nwhich makes this portrayal heroic. In such a peaceful performance, Williams achieves\r\nlayers with muted expressions of angst or defeat, and a confident stillness. In\r\nhis everyman presence, which he achieves before even stepping into the movie's\r\ngeneric suburban setting, Williams is as gentle as he is compassionate for\r\nthose who live with their secrets daily. Just like with his rambunctious\r\ncomedy, he plays this character as an accomplished entertainer with nothing to\r\nlose. \n Advertisement \"Boulevard\" is not just the transformation of Nolan,\r\nbut that of a director. Montiel successfully removes himself from the NYC roots\r\nhe has reflected upon so often in his films that star male aggression, and he\r\nnow takes to nondescript suburbs, with an entirely internal character. A\r\ndisplay of his potential with bare bone filmmaking elements, along with his\r\nable to diversify the energy within his films, \u201cBoulevard\u201d proves a personal success.  The end of the film, which is uncharacteristically upbeat, is\r\ntough. Regardless as to how much one may like the movie, it\u2019s a\r\nbittersweet conclusion. \u201cBoulevard\u201d has\r\nthe unfortunate mark in history as being the last on-screen appearance for\r\nWilliams, and it provides the ending to his on-screen life that tragically\r\ndoesn\u2019t parallel that of his off-screen one. His soulful work here\r\nleaves his career feeling very incomplete; for a few more misguided film\r\nchoices that he might have made, as popular entertainers always do, there would\r\nalso be some very special performance vehicles, as with \"Boulevard.\"\r\nAnd they wouldn\u2019t have just displayed proof of his timeless, humble grandeur.\r\nThey could have done some good for us, too."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "My Blueberry Nights", "Review": "That glistening orange dessert under the opening credits looks like the peachiest peach cobbler in the world, especially when it's overlaid with vibrant boysenberry-creme lettering. It makes your eyes and your mouth water. Wong Kar-Wai's \"My Blueberry Nights\" isn't the first movie to use food, or even dessert, as a romantic metaphor, but this one is unquestionably the creation of a filmmaker with the sensibility of a woozy, love-stricken pastry chef. It's a store-bought bakery-window display cake, infused with flavor essences and color-enhancers. (Is there a cinematic MSG that intensifies the sweetness of eye candy?) Blueberry Nights. Pomegranate Afternoons. Watermelon Dusks. Tangerine-and-Lavender Mornings with a Lemon Splash. Yum. Advertisement You taste \"My Blueberry Nights\" with your retinas. Lick up that luminous string of tart lime windows in the elevated train sliding through midnight-indigo New York. Savor the cranberry mist suffusing the atmosphere in the Memphis bar where they play Otis Redding. There are less appetizing things to look at for 90 minutes than this pretty pie-cart of a movie. Instead of chocolate-dipped strawberries, dollops of whipped cream or frosting rosebuds, its glazed slices are garnished with the faces of Norah Jones, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz and David Strathairn. How much further can this dessert metaphor be pushed? All the way to the end of the movie, it turns out. That's what you pay for, and that's what you get from Wong: luscious, colorful treats that are gorgeous to behold and easy to swallow. \"My Blueberry Nights,\" his English-language debut, is his fluffiest confection. Even the shattered window glass from a romantic-tragedy car wreck sparkles in the street lamps like rock candy crystals. It begins with ... dessert. Jeremy (Law) is the most caring nurturer ever to run a homey cafe in New York. His broken-hearted patrons entrust him with their keys, mawkish symbols of lost love which he collects in a fishbowl should the owners or their ex-lovers ever decide to \"reopen that door.\" He hangs onto their memories, and the key chains associated with them. Elizabeth (Jones, the jazz-pop star, in her film debut) has just broken up with her guy, but can't quite let him go, even though he has been caught having a pork-chop dinner with another woman at this same cafe. So she contributes her keys to the jar for sentimental safekeeping. That's how she learns about the blueberry pie. It seems that, every night, people eat most or all of the other sugary delicacies, but nobody ever orders the blueberry. This is as inexplicable as Jeremy's motivation for continuing to offer it. Elizabeth begins to stop by late at night, after closing, to gorge on the blueberry pie, even though each slice must contain at least 2,046 calories. Like fallen angels, she and Jeremy talk about their lonely descent from cupid's paradise. For a while they are happy together, but she is not yet in the mood for love, so one night she vanishes. Advertisement Next thing she knows she's bartending in a Memphis joint with tasty slabs of Stax-Volt wax on the jukebox. One of the regulars is Arnie (Strathairn), who's run up a big tab, drinking himself into a stupor while stewing over his unfaithful wife (Weitz). During the day, Lizzy (Elizabeth's Memphis name) works in a diner across the street and writes postcards to Jeremy. Next, she's Beth, a waitress in a casino a few hundred miles outside Las Vegas. There she meets Leslie (Portman) a wise-cracking gambler with daddy issues. Will Beth ever become Elizabeth again, and return to New York, wiser but not perceptibly older? It would be easy to say that Wong's lustrous love stories are about nothing so much as sensuous textures and impeccable surfaces, and the play of light across them. It would also be accurate. Some are mesmerizing, some are bittersweet, some are trifles, and this is one of the latter. But they look delicious."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "The Swindlers", "Review": "One can't help but wonder just how much of the charm of the Korean con man thriller \"The Swindlers\" wore off in translation. I readily admit\u00a0that, as someone unfamiliar with the Korean language (beyond a couple of key phrases), the appeal of the film's more\u00a0dialogue-intensive scenes\u00a0were probably lost on me thanks to English subtitles that were often distractingly blocky.\u00a0 Then again, much of this thriller's unbelievably\u00a0formulaic\u00a0plot\u2014a group of\u00a0con men go on a quest to hustle a Bernie Madoff-style scam artist\u2014is already flat-footed. Sure, overly literal\u00a0translations of colloquialisms,\u00a0like \"swindlers,\" are one thing. But there are also, generally speaking, too many scenes that are so contrived that I sometimes wondered if\u00a0a living script template for an \"Ocean's Eleven\"-style heist movie had come to life, and left no cliche behind in its hapless quest to deliver superficially\u00a0topical thrills.\u00a0There's a small chance\u00a0that the subtitles of this film simply aren't\u00a0apparent because of an insurmountable cultural barrier. But it's more likely\u00a0that \"The Swindlers\" was always DOA. Advertisement Take for example the laborious half-hour set-up that quickly, and unconvincingly\u00a0establishes big fish antagonist\u00a0Joo-chil Jang (Sung-tae Heo) as a heartless\u00a0criminal\u00a0who, according to a news reporter, is responsible for \"the biggest Ponzi scheme in history,\" and the suicides of several financially\u00a0destitute\u00a0victims. Everybody wants a piece of Jang, including square-jawed\u00a0lawyer Heeo-soo Park (Ji-tae Yoo), sexy lady\u00a0pickpocket Choon-ja (Nana),\u00a0and cocky\u00a0young\u00a0con man Ji-sung Hwang (Bin Hyun). So, a super-coalition of pretty-looking thieves, almost all played by popular Korean actors, forms with the express purpose\u00a0of taking down\u00a0Jang.\u00a0  Unfortunately, there's not much to\u00a0Hwang's maverick leadership skills, nor his colleagues pseudo-twisty attempts at disarming Jang's many go-betweens, and colleagues. Every major\u00a0story, and\u00a0stylistic beat in \"The Swindlers\" was borrowed\u00a0from better films, especially Steven Soderbergh's \"Ocean's Eleven\" trilogy. Well-dressed\u00a0characters\u00a0watch gigantic TVs, and monitor each other's progress through seemingly omnipresent closed-security televisions. They record\u00a0phone calls and in-office negotiations, hoping to stumble upon incriminating evidence they can use for the next part of their elaborate confidence tricks.\u00a0 They also frequently exclaim key plot points as if they were characters in a really bad\u00a0\"Dick Tracy\" cartoon, like when multiple protagonists\u00a0address Hwang's father Yoo-suk (Jin-young Jung) by his con-man\u00a0nick-name of \"London Fog.\" Lines like \"Good old London Fog,\" and \"What are you thinking, London Fog\" isn't just tin-eared: it's embarrassingly corny. Then again, the real nadir of this method of intelligence-degrading expository dialogue comes during\u00a0Hwang's first scene, when one of Park's men identifies Hwang by exclaiming\u00a0\"That's the guy who only cons the swindlers!\" I'm sure this line sounds relatively better in the original Korean. But this already tacky line\u00a0is especially abysmal when nothing else in \"The Swindlers\" seems to come together.\u00a0 Advertisement Then again, lame dialogue would be bearable if the film's\u00a0cast were more than just generally\u00a0adequate. Sadly, these actors frequently over-play their characters'\u00a0hands so that we\u00a0always know when Park's crew are\u00a0performing. They also usually lack chemistry, which\u00a0sinks any scene where Nana has to seduce already wary subjects. Nana\u00a0plays a naive\u00a0babe in the woods\u00a0well enough, but her mannerisms are expressed\u00a0mostly through\u00a0tics, like pouting, eyelash-batting, and crying. There's never a moment where you can see in her\u00a0what her interchangeable targets should be drooling over. It's bad enough\u00a0that Nana is stuck with pseudo-flirty baby talk like \"Don't I look like a girl to you?\" What's worse is that Nana doesn't even nail a physical-comedy-centric scene like the one where she plays drunk, and tries to convince one of Jang's intermediaries to\u00a0lower his guard. If I were in this guy's position, I would sprint away as fast as I could.\u00a0 It's especially unfortunate that \"The Swindlers\" is exclusively populated by characters and performers who appear to always be acting since the movie's central theme\u00a0is, as (sigh) Night Fog explains the notion that \"doubts\" are all a good con artist needs to persuade a mark since \"Doubts become assurances once they're dispelled.\" Again, a klutzy line of dialogue, but one that could have\u00a0revealed something about the psychology of scammers, and their victims. No such insight can be found here though since every potential source for\u00a0good popcorn entertainment is thrice warmed-over, and poorly executed. You may think that\u00a0you, the viewer, have it bad by\u00a0the sixty minute mark, at which point\u00a0you\u00a0probably\u00a0won't\u00a0care who is inevitably\u00a0going to backstab who. But just think of the poor subtitle translator who had to agonize over dialogue so leaden that it took the joy out of a\u00a0word that's\u00a0as joyfully outdated as \"swindler.\" To that unsung translator: you deserve a substantial\u00a0raise, a major award, and a stiff drink."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Alive Inside", "Review": "\"Alive Inside,\" directed by Michael Rossato-Bennett, is a\r\npassionate documentary with a lot of valuable information to impart, and a\r\nlaudable humanist agenda to push. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also not a particularly\r\ngood movie. In fact, at certain points it can be an actively annoying one.  The subject is how music can awaken the minds of people\r\nsuffering from dementia and/or Alzheimer\u2019s disease (the movie also chronicles,\r\nbriefly, the music therapy undergone by an MS sufferer). It shows patients\r\nreacting to exposure to what had been their favorite music in a different time\r\nin their lives, and this footage, although it arguably infantilizes the\r\nindividuals depicted, also depicts impressive results. The movie goes on to\r\nindict the American healthcare system/industry, which, apparently, is more\r\ninterested in pushing costly pharmaceutical treatments than any kind of\r\ntherapeutic model. As a result, souls, hearts, and lives are receding when\r\nmaybe they don\u2019t have to be.  Advertisement Pertinent well-known experts make their views known.\r\nNeurologist Oliver Sacks, the author of a book on the effects of music on the\r\nbrain, offers solid science; musician Bobby McFerrin is an articulate proponent\r\nof those qualities of music that can\u2019t be scientifically quantified. They\u2019re\r\nilluminating.  Mr. Rossato-Bennett, alas, is less engaging, and he\u2019s the\r\nmost insistent voice in the film. Crafting the movie as a work of activism,\r\nhe\u2019s pretty much the anti-Nicolas-Philibert, whose films such as \"In The Land\r\nOf The Deaf\" immersed viewers in a different state of being. He frames the\r\nexperience of the patients through his own lens explicitly from the very start,\r\nstating in his narration of working with physician and music therapy pioneer\r\nDan Cohen, \u201cWhat unfolded that first day moved me so much\u2026\u201d that he had to\r\netcetera, etcetera.\u00a0The narration (\u201cWe\r\nwent looking for answers\u201d) and off-screen questions (\u201cYou like the music you\u2019re\r\nhearing? Tell me about the music\u201d) are insistently pushy and intrusive\r\nthroughout\u2014and the visual approach is a greeting-card one, at best.  A filmmaker who\u2019s always telling us what we ought to be\r\nfeeling is usually one who cannot actually evoke feeling. And so it is here.\r\nThe Sacks and McFerrin mini-episodes start coming off as sweet relief as\r\nRossato-Bennett starts laying on the faux-\"Koyaanisqatsi\" slow-and-fast motion\r\nshots, and things reach a particularly eye-rolling level near the end, when the\r\nmovie turns into an advertisement for itself, reprising a CNN segment in which\r\nthe filmmaker and Cohen talk about a patient-reaction clip that went \u201cviral\u201d on\r\nsocial media. This is understandable as an activist tactic; I get that. But as\r\na segment in a feature documentary targeting an audience of adults, it felt\r\ncondescending in an especially unwholesome way. Whether or not this approach\r\nactually succeeds in getting changes made to the system, the subject, and the\r\nhuman subjects, deserve something a lot better than what this movie gives them.\r\nIt doesn\u2019t feel great to have to say that, but it\u2019s the truth."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Sex and the City 2", "Review": "Some of these people make my skin crawl. The characters of \"Sex and the City 2\" are flyweight bubbleheads living in a world which rarely requires three sentences in a row. Their defining quality is consuming things. They gobble food, fashion, houses, husbands, children, vitamins and freebies. They must plan their wardrobes on the phone, so often do they appear in different basic colors, like the plugs you pound into a Playskool workbench. As we return to the trivialities of their lives for a sequel, marriage is the issue. The institution is affirmed in an opening sequence at a gay wedding in Connecticut that looks like a Fred Astaire production number gone horribly over budget. There's a 16-man chorus in white formal wear, a pond with swans, and Liza Minnelli to perform the ceremony. Her religious or legal qualifications are unexplained; perhaps she is present merely as the patron saint of gay men. After the ceremony, she changes to a Vegas lounge outfit and is joined by two lookalike backups for a song and dance routine possibly frowned upon in some denominations. Advertisement Then it's back to the humdrum married life of our gal Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and the loathsome Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Carrie, honey, how can you endure life with this purring, narcissistic, soft-velvet idiot? He speaks loudly enough to be heard mostly by himself, his most appreciative audience. And he never wants to leave the house at night, preferring to watch classic black-and-white movies on TV. This leads to a marital crisis. Carrie thinks they should talk more. But sweetheart, Mr. Big has nothing to say. At least he's provided you with a Manhattan apartment that looks like an Architectural Digest wet dream. Brief updates. Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) is a high-powered lawyer who is dissed by her male chauvinist pig boss. Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) is still a sexaholic slut. Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) has the two little girls she thought she wanted, but now discovers that they actually expect to be raised. Mothers, if you are reading, run this through your head. One little girl dips her hands in strawberry topping and plants two big handprints on your butt. You are on the cell to a girlfriend. How do you report this? You moan and wail out: \"My vintage Valentino!\" Any mother who wears her vintage Valentino while making muffin topping with her kids should be hauled up before the Department of Children and Family Services.  All of this is pretty thin gruel. The movie shows enterprise, and flies the entire cast away to the emirate of Abu Dhabi, where the girls are given a $22,000-a-night suite and matching Maybachs and butlers, courtesy of a sheik who wants to have a meeting with Samantha and talk about publicity for his hotel. This sequence is an exercise in obscenely conspicuous consumption, in which the girls appear in so many different outfits they must have been followed to the Middle East by a luggage plane. I don't know a whole lot about fashion, but I know something about taste, and these women spend much of the movie dressed in tacky, vulgar clothing. Carrie and Samantha also display the maximum possible boobage, oblivious to Arab ideas about women's modesty. There's more cleavage in this film than at a pro wrestler's wedding. Advertisement And crotches, have we got crotches for you. Big close-ups of the girls themselves, and some of the bulgers they meet. And they meet some. They meet the Australian world cup team, for example, which seems to have left its cups at home. And then there's the intriguing stranger Samantha meets at the hotel, whose zipper-straining arousal evokes the fury of an offended Arab guest and his wife. This prodigy's name is Rikard Spirt. Think about it. Samantha is arrested for kissing on the beach, and there's an uncomfortable scene in which the girls are menaced by outraged men in a public market, where all they've done is dress in a way more appropriate for a sales reception at Victoria's Secret. They're rescued by Arab women so well covered only their eyes are visible, and in private these women reveal that underneath the burkas they're wearing Dior gowns and so forth. Must get hot. I wondered briefly whether Abu Dhabi had underwritten all this product placement, but I learn the \"SATC2\" was filmed in Morocco, which must be Morocco's little joke. That nation supplies magnificent desert scenes, achieved with CGI, I assume, during which two of the girls fall off a camel. I haven't seen such hilarity since \"Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion.\" The movie's visual style is arthritic. Director Michael Patrick King covers the sitcom dialogue by dutifully cutting back and forth to whoever is speaking. A sample of Carrie's realistic dialogue in a marital argument: \"You knew when I married you I was more Coco Chanel than coq au vin.\" Carrie also narrates the film, providing useful guidelines for those challenged by its intricacies. Sample: \"Later that day, Big and I arrived home.\" Truth in reviewing: I am obliged to report that this film will no doubt be deliriously enjoyed by its fans, for the reasons described above. Male couch potatoes dragged to the film against their will may find some consolation. Reader, I must confess that while attending the sneak preview with its overwhelmingly female audience, I was gob-smacked by the delightful cleavage on display. Do women wear their lowest-cut frocks for each other? Note: From my understanding of the guidelines of the MPAA Code and Ratings Administration, Samantha and Mr. Spirt have one scene that far, far surpasses the traditional MPAA limits for pumping and thrusting.

{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Shame", "Review": "There's a close-up in \"Shame\" of Michael Fassbender's face showing pain, grief and anger. His character, Brandon, is having an orgasm. For the movie's writer-director, Steve McQueen, that could be the film's master shot. There is no concern about the movement of Brandon's lower body. No concern about his partner. The close-up limits our view to his suffering. He is enduring a sexual function that has long since stopped giving him any pleasure and is self-abuse in the most profound way. Brandon is a good-looking, fit man in his early 30s, who lives alone in a sterile condo in Manhattan. He works in a cubicle with a computer. Never mind what his company does. It makes no difference to him. Sometimes in the evening, he and his boss, David (James Badge Dale), go out to drink in singles bars. David is a little hyper with his pick-up lines. Brandon just sits there, his face impassive, and has better luck. He doesn't hope to get lucky. He doesn't think of it as luck. Sex is his cross to bear. Advertisement I remember when the notion of sexual addiction was first being mentioned. People treated it as a joke. It was referred to in late-night monologues. The American Psychiatric Association in 1987 defined it as a mental disorder involving \"distress about a pattern of repeated sexual conquests \u2026 involving a succession of people who exist only as things to be used.\"  The APA is no longer certain it is a disorder. Whatever it is, Brandon suffers from it. In \"Shame,\" however, he himself is the only thing being used. One or two of his sexual partners may be attracted to him in the sense that some men are attracted to nymphomaniacs. There is such a sadness involved. \"Shame\" makes into a lie the universal assumption in movies that orgasms provide a pleasure to be pursued. The film's opening shot shows Brandon awake in the morning, staring immobile into space. He could be a man prepared to commit suicide. He gets out of bed, goes into the shower and masturbates. It will be the first of his many orgasms, solitary and with company, that day. He never reveals emotion. He lives like a man compelled to follow an inevitable course.  He is cold to people. To prostitutes, to co-workers, to strangers. On the subway, he trades eye contact with a woman who may be flirting. Is he flirting? To boldly maintain eye contact is a form of flirting and an aggressive challenge. But he doesn't smile. His is a dreadful life. One day he comes home and someone is there. We think it may be an intruder. It is Sissy (Carey Mulligan), his sister, although for a time, we don't know that. He flies at her in a rage, telling her to get out. She has nowhere to go. He doesn't care. His shame is masked in privacy. He wants no witnesses to his hookers, his pornography, his masturbation. Does he think he is incapable of ordinary human contact? In time, we will suspect that Brandon and Sissy shared childhood experiences that damaged them. McQueen wisely is not specific about the incidents. Advertisement Brandon lives in a cold, forlorn Manhattan. When he is in a group, he is alone. The sidewalks seem unusually empty. He knows where to go in order to have sex. In one sequence, that involves a gay bar. He isn't gay, in my opinion, but then how is he heterosexual? He loves no one, is attracted to no one, is driven to find occasions for orgasm \u2014 whether alone or in company hardly seems to matter. The introduction of Sissy allows the film some spontaneity and life. She is as passionate and uninhibited as he is the opposite. She needs him desperately. He fears need. They rage at each other. She works sometimes as a cabaret singer, and in one scene, she performs a song heartbreakingly in close-up. This close-up also shows pain and grief, but no anger. Not many actors would have the courage it took Michael Fassbender to play this role. He showed similar courage in McQueen's \"Hunger\" (2009), about the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. The actor and director seem to have found a common resolve in these films to show the thing itself, unalloyed by audience-pleasing techniques. Brandon can't even be said to visibly suffer. He is compelled to repeat the same behavior over and over, and all he gets from it is self-loathing. \"Shame\" is the correct title. \"Shame\" contains unblinking truth. I have no doubt it depicts behavior that can be accurately called \"sex addiction.\" The film suggests no help for Brandon, although toward the end, he moves somewhat in the direction of being able to care for another human being. For him, that involves being able to care for himself, despite the truth that he feels unworthy to be known. This is a great act of filmmaking and acting. I don't believe I would be able to see it twice."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "When the Game Stands Tall", "Review": "To\r\n fully understand what\u2019s in store in the real-life football parable \r\n\u201cWhen the Game Stands Tall,\u201d it\u2019s probably good to know that star Jim \r\nCaviezel\u2019s most noteworthy film role was as Jesus in \u201cThe Passion of the\r\n Christ.\u201d\u00a0  Turns\r\n out his ability to preach and sway his disciples comes in pretty handy \r\nas Bob Ladouceur, the high-school coach behind the miraculous \r\ndecade-plus, record-breaking streak of 151 wins achieved by the De La \r\nSalle Spartans of suburban Concord, Calif.  Stoic, soft-spoken and solemn\u2014think the opposite of blustery Al Pacino in \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d\u2014Coach Lad, as he is called, doesn\u2019t so much give pep talks as \r\ndeliver soul-enriching sermons. He underplays the importance of \r\ncollecting trophies and beating opponents and instead promotes a sense \r\nof brotherhood, having your teammate\u2019s back and pushing yourself to the\r\n limit and beyond to achieve your goals.  Advertisement His approach to the game, one that he has given most of his life to, is perhaps best summed up in a quotation from Matthew 23:13\r\n that is recited onscreen: \u201cWhoever exalts himself shall be humbled. And\r\n whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.\u201d In other words, it is not \r\nabout you, it is about others. All\r\n these sentiments are worthwhile, of course. And considering that De La \r\nSalle is a Catholic school and Coach Lad also was a religious studies \r\nteacher, they aren\u2019t gratuitous. Still, most often in its early \r\nstages, the melodrama onscreen edges precipitously close to dissolving \r\ninto a puddle of platitudinous pabulum served in the manner of a rote Sunday school lesson. Part\r\n of the problem with this particular sports story is the difficulty of \r\npresenting De La Salle as an underdog. Which is why producer David \r\nZelon (\u201cSoul Surfer,\u201d another Christian-influenced sports film) and \r\ndirector Thomas Carter (\u201cCoach Carter\u201d) decided to zone in on the year \r\n2004, when the Spartans lost their focus after Coach Lad suffered a \r\nlife-threatening heart attack (turns out he was a secret smoker\u2014a \r\nreason for a PG rating) and one of the team\u2019s brightest stars is killed \r\nin a random shooting (the other reason for a PG rating).  With\r\n their leader sidelined and a tragic act of violence resulting in a \r\npainful absence in the lineup, the streak soon is as broken as the \r\nplayers\u2019 sense of dedication. After losing the first two games of the \r\nseason, Coach Lad is given the OK to resume his duties. And we as \r\nmoviegoers apparently have paid enough penance and watched enough \r\nhardships to finally earn the right to see some actual football being \r\nplayed.  Of\r\n course, coming back from a two-game slump doesn\u2019t exactly qualify as a \r\nresurrection even though the filmmakers pull out every trick in the book\r\n to make it seem that way. The actual turning point that prevents\u00a0 \u201cWhen\r\n the Game Stands Tall\u201d from becoming totally insufferable arrives \r\nearlier when the kids go on a field trip to visit wounded veterans in a\r\n recovery facility. The nervous and ultimately heartfelt interaction \r\nbetween the fresh-faced actors and these wounded warriors who brave \r\nthrough their disabilities is the film\u2019s first of too-few emotional \r\ntouchdowns.  Advertisement Certainly,\r\n it is preferable than hearing Coach Lad\u2019s dutiful wife (Laura Dern, who\r\n tries her best but is ill-served by the script) observe for the \r\numpteenth time that his job causes him to neglect his real family. How \r\nneglectful is he? He doesn\u2019t even know how to grill a burger. Some dad \r\nhe is. Watching him toss the charred hockey pucks into the bushes? \r\nPriceless, but not all that funny.  There are roughly 10 too many scenes of workouts involving giant tires pulled\r\n down the field by rope wrapped around a player\u2019s body to symbolize \r\ntheir renewed drive. But the game action is fairly well shot and edited \r\n(although those bone-cruncher sound effects that resound every time someone \r\ngets hit are a bit much). And the young actors, topped by Alexander \r\nLudwig (tribute Cato in \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d) as an ace running back, \r\noccasionally flash a welcome spark of spontaneity and share a natural \r\nrapport together.  But\r\n Michael Chiklis doesn\u2019t get to inject nearly enough humor as Coach \r\nLad\u2019s more demonstrative assistant. And Clancy Brown as Ludwig\u2019s father \r\nis beyond redemption as the standard overbearing abusive parent who \r\nlives vicariously through his son\u2019s victories. The\r\n final acid test of whether \u201cWhen the Game Stands Tall\u201d stands up to \r\nsome of the greatest sports films? I have tissues at the ready when I \r\njust think about \"Brian\u2019s Song\" and \"Rudy,\" I\u2019ve been known to shed a tear \r\nor two over \"Field of Dreams\" and I always bawl my eyes out during \"The \r\nBlind Side\" when it shows up on cable. \r\n But this sucker for scoreboard sentiment was left dry-eyed this time. \r\nTo be fair, there was a glitch at my screening of \u201cWhen the Game Stands \r\nTall\u201d and the sound went out with seconds to go in the final game. But \r\nit\u2019s doubtful that it would have made any difference, judging by what I \r\ncould at least see. Just as any coach would tell you, it is not whether \r\nyou win or lose, it is how you play the game. But even though \"When the \r\nGame Stands Tall\" comes alive occasionally, it is basically a dropped \r\nball.\u00a0  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Thousand Faces of Dunjia", "Review": "I'm sad to report that the unnecessarily busy Hong Kong action-fantasy \"The Thousand Faces of Dunjia\" confused the hell out of me. This is not, however, just because I was (and am still)\u00a0unfamiliar with some key astrological\u00a0concepts, and related character types that the film revolves around. Rather, this big, splashy blockbuster is perplexing because it's full of loosely-connected incidents that are rarely character-driven, or even narratively intelligible beyond a point. The film's plot, which concerns the super-powered Wuyin clan's attempts at\u00a0stopping a hostile alien invasion, feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overstuffed. New heroes, villains, locations, and side quests are introduced every few minutes. And the only thing propelling the film's plot forward through its many confusing tangents is a lot of\u00a0bad computer-generated special effects. The fact that the film isn't even visually impressive\u00a0is especially disappointing given that \"The Thousand Faces of Dunjia\" was directed by legendary\u00a0action choreographer turned director Woo-ping Yuen (\"True Legend,\" \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Sword of Destiny\"). And the plot of the film is equally underwhelming once you realize the film was produced and\u00a0scripted by iconoclastic action filmmaker Tsui Hark (\"Detective Dee:\u00a0Mystery of the Phantom Flame,\" \"Knock Off\").\u00a0A lot of things transpire in any given scene, but\u00a0none of them will make you care what happens next.\u00a0 Advertisement Let's start from the top. There are two yin/yang type elements that everybody in this film is at least superficially concerned with:\u00a0\"Qimen\" and \"Dunjia.\" While \"Qimen\" has something to do with the passage of time, \"Dunjia\" is a style of astrological divination. A\u00a0skimpy voiceover introduction\u00a0attempts to distinguish\u00a0these two concepts, but this preface doesn't\u00a0sensibly\u00a0inform the characters' actions in a way that somebody who's only using the events of \"The Thousand Faces of Dunjia\" as their primary source of information\u00a0can understand. It's like watching an Avengers movie, except all the callbacks, and character motives are only comprehensible if you're familiar with the comic books.\u00a0 Things only\u00a0get more convoluted, and confusing from here. The Wuyin clan are racing against time\u2014and logic\u2014to stop a creepy\u00a0red tentacle\u00a0plant-alien from manipulating the Dunjia device (There's only one?), and\u00a0five sage warriors (Where'd they come from?)\u00a0from using\u00a0a weapon called The Destroyer of Worlds (Who made this?) to ... uh ... presumably take over the planet for themselves? The Wuyins are guardians of the Dunjia thingy, but they can't stop the ... alien guy (or girl) ... from rampaging across multiple disparate locations that may or may not be geographically far apart. It's hard to tell since time passes episodically in \"The Thousand Faces of Dunjia,\" and there's no great urgency to the film's plot.\u00a0 There are some minor personal connections that provide a skimpy emotional tether for the Wuyin clan's quest to stop that one completely non-threatening-looking\u00a0monster from wreaking\u00a0more plot-related mischief.\u00a0Headstrong fighter\u00a0Dragonfly (Ni Ni) has a chaste romance with bookish doctor Qingyun Zhuge (Peng Da), but shy\u00a0shape-shifting monster-lady Circle (Yan Liu) has a thing for Zhuge too. Also, Dragonfly's stalwart leader (Bai Wu) is there too, but he doesn't do much. Wait, what was I saying, oh, right, the characters.\u00a0 Advertisement The best scenes in \"The Thousand Faces of Dunjia\" feel as small as anecdotes, but are as detailed as a chapter in a rich fantasy\u00a0novel. I loved the\u00a0sequence\u00a0where Zhuge bluffs, and\u00a0hustles his way into a subterranean dungeon to find and free Circle,\u00a0formerly a nameless prisoner held for reasons that are never adequately explained. These scenes reminded me of the best moments in the classic Chinese action-fantasy\u00a0\"Journey to the West,\" one of the\u00a0most popular novels in China. Still, thinking about \"Journey to the West\" only\u00a0reminded me of everything \"The Thousand Faces of Dunjia\" gets wrong\u00a0since Hark and Yuen's film was\u00a0arguably only made because of the financial popularity of a\u00a0recent cycle of\u00a0\"Journey to the West\"\u00a0adaptations, all of which are very loose riffs on their decades-old source material. You don't need to have done homework to enjoy\u00a0the superior \"Journey to the West\" films, including \"Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons,\" a loose adaptation\u00a0that Hark directed the sequel to. These films are narratively\u00a0accessible, emotionally involving, and visually impressive. The same cannot be said of \"The Thousand Faces of Dunjia,\" a confusing collection of ideas that never comes together in a meaningful, or even superficially compelling. Even the computer-generated action scenes feel like they were assembled by a committee of dedicated, but uninspired of computer artists. You don't always have to understand what's happening in a film to enjoy it. But it certainly helps when there's nothing else noteworthy going on."}

What do they all have in common?\u00a0A sense of fear and loathing of that vast and insular wasteland known as suburbia. \u201cLittle Boxes,\u201d a modest comedy-drama that is super-eager to join that elite club but doesn\u2019t quite meet all the membership requirements, at least exhibits a bit of audacity by borrowing its title from a popular anti-conformity folk ode from the early \u201860s that served TV\u2019s \u201cWeeds\u201d so well for several seasons.\u00a0 Advertisement This ticky-tacky-ish spin on a much-trodden theme involves a likable though somewhat naive interracial couple (Melanie Lynskey and Nelsan Ellis) and their 11-year-old son (Armani Jackson, rocking a mushroom-like Afro) who leave the multitudinously diverse and intellectually stimulating environment afforded by Brooklyn for the lily-white small-town atmosphere of Rome, Wash., where photographer mom Gina has found a benefits-loaded teaching job at a college art department. The opening images of Rome (whose welcome sign bears the slogan \u201cWhere Culture is Home!\u201d) are edgily shot and edited like the start of a horror flick, complete with ambient sounds. Think Stars Hollow from \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d but without the kitschy local color, endearingly eccentric citizenry and fewer places to buy coffee.\u00a0 Shortly after they arrive at their roomy new abode with its mature trees, spacious lawns, multiple bathrooms and lack of urban noise, annoyances begin to pile up. First, the movers have yet to arrive with their earthly possessions. Stay-at-home dad Mack, an easy-going jazz aficionado and published author in the midst of working on his sophomore novel, keeps suspiciously sniffing at the air in the kitchen (turns out, there\u2019s mold lurking behind the walls). Plus, he also writes articles about food\u2014and the gas range is inconveniently broken. As the threesome begins to meet and mingle with the locals, they are initially treated as welcome curiosities more for their big-city ways than anything else. A trio of tenured profs\u2014with Janeane Garofalo as the ring leader\u2014take Gina under their wing and tutor her on the joys of chatty liquid lunches. Mack\u2014a bit adrift\u2014stumbles upon the seemingly friendly overseer of the block association and then, rather desperately, heads to the local book store to check to see if his first book is available there (it isn\u2019t).\u00a0 Advertisement Meanwhile, cute Clark quickly finds an eager fan base: two soon-to-be sixth-grade classmates who are precocious girls\u2014petite Ambrosia (Oona Laurence) and gangly Julie (Miranda McKeon). Ambrosia, in particular, is excited by his arrival, proclaiming, \u201cWe like totally needed a black kid. This town is SO white!\u201d The pair entertain their new friend by showing off their inappropriately suggestive dance routine set to the music of a hip-hop performer known as 2 Bit, who we learn from Julie, \u201cused to be a ho.\u201d This is all a prelude to Ambrosia\u2019s eventual attempts to put the moves on Clark at some point when they are alone in Julie\u2019s unsupervised home. Matters go downhill when Ambrosia\u2019s single mother (Christine Taylor, smartly navigating a difficult role) catches her daughter and Clark semi-innocently goofing around on Julie\u2019s bed. All this hyper-sexuality at an early age is rightfully treated with the seriousness it deserves and eventually builds to a much-needed clearing of the air between neighbors. But it also drains nearly all of the humor out of the movie. Sorrows are drowned in alcohol and cigarettes, arguments break out, an act of vandalism occurs\u2014and assumptions and accusations are made before a truce finally is called. Not even a lively bout of karaoke involving group sing of Gilbert and Sullivan as well as off-key Spandau Ballet solo can lighten the mood. \u201cLittle Boxes\u201d doesn\u2019t manage to summon as much unique insight into prejudice as screenwriter Annie Howell and director Ron Meyer probably expected to achieve. But what keeps their movie watchable is that Lynskey, Ellis and Jackson are completely believable as a loving family unit going through a rough patch concerning their sense of identity and place as they uneasily adapt to a foreign and sometimes difficult situation. We want the best for them, despite their own occasional misguided judgments about people. But we would also like a better and more ambitious film for them, too, one that doesn\u2019t tell us something we already know and seen before. And, for those who are wondering, you will indeed hear a piano-heavy instrumental rendition of the song \u201cLittle Boxes\u201d as the end credits roll.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Bitter Harvest", "Review": "If movies were rated according to the importance of their subject matter, then George Mendeluk\u2019s \u201cBitter Harvest,\u201d which tells of the devastating famine Josef Stalin visited on the Ukraine in the 1930s, would deserve an unqualified four stars. If the same film were judged solely on its cinematic quality, though, it would barely merit one star. I\u2019m giving it two here as a way of recognizing the interest of the historical horror it rather clumsily addresses. As readers of Timothy D. Snyder\u2019s magisterial study Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin will know, the two great European despots of the last century inflicted enormous suffering and staggering casualties not only on various populations but also on the nations that separated Germany and Russia. Yet even before Hitler\u2019s armies swept across Poland, where it built many of the death camps that would be used in the slaughter of Europe\u2019s Jews, Stalin had already set a high bar in the mass-murder department with his deliberate starvation of millions of Ukrainians. Advertisement The Nazis\u2019 genocide, which came to be known as the Holocaust, has been treated in an endless stream of movies, both documentary and dramatic, as well as books, articles, TV shows and public commemorations and memorials across the West. Stalin\u2019s crime in the Ukraine, now called the Holodomor, was never given similar attention and now is little-known outside the part of the world where it took place. Without question, the Holodomor deserves examination, interrogation and commemoration. But it strikes me that the best place to start, cinema-wise, might be with a documentary that has the scope and power of Claude Lanzmann\u2019s \u201cShoah.\u201d Almost inevitably, approaching the subject via a standard-length dramatic feature risks reducing the cataclysm\u2019s enormity to a trivializing size and emotional impact. Unfortunately, \u201cBitter Harvest\u201d can\u2019t even claim the virtues of a superior dramatic feature. Born in Germany of Ukrainian descent, Mendeluk has spent most his career as a director of Canadian TV movies, which this film unsurprisingly resembles. Although its title recalls \u201cAngry Harvest,\u201d a brilliant Holocaust film, \u201cBitter Harvest\u201d resembles no estimable European or American movie on such subjects as much as it does a lot of sub-par and instantly forgotten video attempts to plumb historical abominations. Its narrative and visual approach almost suggests a compendium of the clich\u00e9s one should avoid in a film like this. The first, which occupies the tale\u2019s opening sections, might be called the clich\u00e9 of the Happy Peasantry. In images that recall a Campbell\u2019s soup commercial, we see the farm families of one Ukrainian village joyfully tilling their acres, harvesting their abundant crops and displaying their roomy, well-washed blouses and Cossack shirts; they are the descendants of proud warriors, we\u2019re told, who venerate their noble traditions and Eastern Orthodox faith. Rather dubiously, it\u2019s posited that their blissfully bucolic way of life continues through the Russian Revolution, the murder of the Czar\u2019s family and Lenin\u2019s regime. It\u2019s only when Stalin ascends the Kremlin throne that storm clouds from the east come roaring in. Advertisement In this initial section, we also encounter the dual clich\u00e9s of Hero as Sensitive Artist and Young Lovers Sundered. The peasant who loves to paint is the dreamily-handsome Yuri (Max Irons), whose favorite subject is the girl he\u2019s had a crush on since childhood, Natalka (Samantha Barks). Here the film\u2019s imagery recalls shampoo ads. Alas, though Yuri has been proclaiming his love for 15 or so years, Natalka still balks at marriage. Soon he\u2019s persuaded to move to Kiev to study art, and the village he leaves behind is invaded by brutish Soviet troops, who show their hostility to religion by stealing devotional icons and roughing up the local priest. In Kiev, Yuri studies under a modernist who urges him to emulate the Surrealists and big names like Picasso, and we know it\u2019s trouble when this guy is replaced by an automaton demanding Socialist Realism. Life in the big city, meanwhile, increasingly becomes a political nightmare as Ukrainian Communist leaders, including friends of Yuri\u2019s from back home, are liquidated and replaced by commissars from Russia. Occasionally, the scene shifts to the Kremlin, where we see Stalin giving orders that he knows will kill millions. Ukraine is known as \u201cthe breadbasket of Europe,\u201d and the Soviet leader wants its grain to feed his vast nation. But he\u2019s also out to subdue the farming population into forced collectivization, and that entails leaving the farmers with less grain than they need to plant the next year\u2019s crop, much less feed their families. The cruelty of this campaign offers ample testament to the extraordinary evils of leftist totalitarianism, much as Auschwitz does to the rightist variety. But \u201cBitter Harvest\u201d does little to advance its rhetorical case with scenes like the unintentionally silly one where the village\u2019s Soviet commander begins flashing on his mother while trying to ravish Natalka (paging Dr. Freud!). Seriousness apart, though, there\u2019s undeniable entertainment value in a number of scenes in which the magnificent Terence Stamp, as Yuri\u2019s grandfather, displays his Cossack-fighting skills. If Grandpa had been able to go mano a mano with Stalin, no doubt this dark chapter in world history might\u2019ve had a brighter ending. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy", "Review": "Yes, we imagine, international espionage is probably pretty much like this. No thrilling car chases and no big action scenes, but rather a series of weary men, smoking and drinking tea or whiskey, in a series of conversations that circle an enigma. \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" is about the search for a high-level Soviet spy within MI6, the British intelligence service. This mole is not to be found in an exotic location, but seems more than likely to be one of the men in the room. The movie is based on John Le Carre's 1974 novel, which redefined modern spy fiction and inspired an ambitious 1979 BBC adaptation. There was reason to believe Le Carre knew his subject. In the real world, where his real name is David Cornwall, he was one of the British spies who was betrayed by Kim Philby, the notorious MI6 operative who was a double agent for the Soviets. In the fictional version, MI6 is headed by Control (John Hurt), who studies a series of intelligence leaks and becomes convinced there's a mole in the agency; the nature of the intelligence suggests it must come from high up, and Control narrows his list of suspects to five men close to him. Advertisement The movie introduces them one by one, each played by a familiar face in a film cast with iconic British actors. \"Tinker\" is Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), \"Tailor\" is Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), \"Soldier\" is Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds), \"Poor Man\" is Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) and \"Beggarman\" is George Smiley (Gary Oldman), Control's trusted lieutenant. If you're wondering what happened to \"Spy,\" that would be whoever turns out to be the mole. The film, set mostly in London in the early 1970s, is bathed in browns, shadows and pale lighting. All of the men show a lot of wear, none more than Control; John Hurt's face is weary and deeply lined, his eyes set deep out of the way of cigarette smoke, but lest you think that is entirely because of aging, I interviewed him in 1984 while he was filming \"1984,\" and he looked much the same then.  As the film opens, he has learned that a Hungarian general who would know the mole's identity may be a possible defector. In a muted, serious conversation that will set the film's tone, he assigns Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) to go to Budapest and talk to this man. That mission goes wrong and serves to alert the Soviets -- although the mole would already know Control was engaged in sniffing him out. In the kerfuffle that follows, both Control and Smiley are dismissed from the service. Some time later, Control is dead from a heart attack, and Smiley is recalled from \"retirement\" to continue the search for the mole.  Now follows a series of paranoid meetings in sealed rooms, snatched conversations in obscure corners of London and flashbacks that may cast light on Smiley's investigation, although we cannot yet know for sure. All of this is superbly atmospheric in the hands of director Tomas Alfredson, who made the sober and effective vampire movie \"Let the Right One In.\" His camera is implacable, its moves sinister, the rooms are filled with smoke and fear, and the characters warily circle around \u2014 well, each other, really. Advertisement \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" looks, sounds and feels exactly right. Alfredson's film is faithful to the tone set by the novel. But the screenplay, by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan, is not a model of clarity. I confess I was confused some of the time and lost at other times; the viewer needs to hold in mind a large number of characters, a larger number of events and an infinite number of possibilities.  More ordinary spy movies provide helpful scenes in which characters brief each other as a device to keep the audience oriented. I have every confidence that in this film, every piece of information is there and flawlessly meshes, but I can't say so for sure, perhaps because I don't have a mind suitable for espionage. I enjoyed the film's look and feel, the perfectly modulated performances, and the whole tawdry world of spy and counterspy, which must be among the world's most dispiriting occupations. But I became increasingly aware that I didn't always follow all the allusions and connections. On that level, \"Tinker Tailor\" didn't work for me."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Skinwalker Ranch", "Review": "Award for most unappetizing title of the year probably does have to go to \"Skinwalker Ranch,\" which sounds like a place Luke Skywalker retired to make pornographic films in some distant and forgiving galaxy far, far away. But this is actually a movie that is better than its title, a horror film in the \"found footage\" genre. It does its own miniature version of \"The Thing,\" right down to the tall carrot-type alien figure and the scientist character who cares little about the personal safety of his team and everything about the superior being that is terrorizing them.   Advertisement The film begins with a fairly lame title that reads: \"Warning: The following footage might be disturbing to some viewers.\" Ranch owner Hoyt Miller (Jon Gries) see his young son spirited away by what seem like alien forces, and there is talk of paranormal activity, \"dark\" soil, animal mutilations, and other things that go bump in the night. We see a few town people being interviewed about the ranch, and these talking heads skirt dangerously close to Christopher Guest-mockumentary territory without ever settling outright for sketchy comedy or hardscrabble reality.  The expected group of researchers descends on the ranch to investigate, and they start to think that Hoyt might be making things up until they start to experience spooky things themselves. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to tell if the characters are anxious or if the actors are just trying to remember their lines, but it is clear that everyone believes in what they are doing, and they are doing it to the best of their ability. The people in this movie do not stand out as individuals all that much, but that\u2019s probably because they\u2019re too busy running around and fighting and screaming in fear before they\u2019ve been properly established.  The somewhat charming thing about \"Skinwalker Ranch\" is that it takes itself seriously. Even though the style is very much paint-by-numbers, with handheld footage alternating with static surveillance shots of various locations on the ranch, the core of the film is sincere. When Hoyt speaks about how sweet his young son was, the movie gains a core of emotion that helps us to care about whether or not the boy gets rescued.  Toward the end of the film, other children are seen who are stuck in some kind of video time warp; people of a certain age and generation will probably be reminded of one of the more frightening live action Walt Disney movies, \"The Watcher in the Woods,\" where a blindfolded girl is trapped in some in-between world and keeps reaching out for help. The handheld footage keeps breaking up, which is an expected trope of this genre, as if the scariest thing of all for us today would be technological blackout. There is no point in \"Skinwalker Ranch\" when it seems as if this could actually be found footage, but it does garner a few scares and even a few honest laughs in its rather short running time. If you\u2019re looking for a neat little Halloween movie, you could do worse.  Advertisement"}

Sure, Chuck Berry invented licks and riffs and a worldview that invented \u201crock n roll,\u201d but Wray, with a surly distorted tone that one-upped the broken-amplifier crackle of Ike Turner\u2019s axe on \u201cRocket 88,\u201d helped invent \u201crock.\u201d Hendrix, hard rock, heavy metal all owe him big.  Advertisement He\u2019s the launching pad for this movie about Native Americans (here called \u201cIndians\u201d for reasons that become clearer as the movie goes on) and their influence not just on rock but on American music. As is pointed out more than once, the music of the Shawnee, the Choctaw, the Mohawk, the Apache, and so many other tribes, is in a very real sense the first American music. Race-mixing between blacks and Indians resulted in a cultural consciousness that enabled a melding of African music and Indian. Among other things, the movie makes a convincing case that the Indian tradition was one explicitly drawn upon by Charlie Patton, one of the giants of Delta Blues. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. The movie, directed by Catherine Bainbridge with Alfonso Maiorana, begins with Wray. And the section devoted to him is actually the weakest one in the movie. As if wanting to convince the viewer as to its authoritativeness, it mixes scintillating archival footage of the badass guitarist, from clean-cut-with-pomaded-hair \u201850s incarnation to leather-clad \u201870s Gibson SG mangler with a parade of talking heads talking about how significant \u201cRumble\u201d was. I enjoy hearing from Steven Van Zandt, the MC5\u2019s Wayne Kramer, Slash, music critic David Fricke et. al. as much as the next enthusiast, but after a while I\u2019m thinking, \u201cInstead of talking so much about \u2018Rumble,\u2019 how about letting us actually HEAR more of it?\u201d  It\u2019s also peculiar that the movie drops Wray pretty much right after giving us the news that \u201cRumble\u201d was banned from a host of radio stations, a signal accomplishment for an instrumental. \u201cThe theme song of juvenile delinquency,\u201d Van Zandt says, delightedly. Wray\u2019s subsequent career was as action-packed and eccentric as any rock figure you can name, and it doesn\u2019t get played out here. Maybe they\u2019re saving it for a separate documentary.  But the stories the film tells after Wray\u2019s are mostly well-done and frequently moving mini-movies. A section in New Orleans, featuring local hero Monk Boudreaux and several members of the Neville Brothers, is a superb pr\u00e9cis of the roots of that region\u2019s infectious music. Buffy Sainte Marie speaks of becoming a musician by happenstance, and suffering under a blacklist she wasn\u2019t even explicitly aware of for almost twenty years. Robbie Robertson recount his procession from journeyman teen guitarist to Bob Dylan\u2019s wingman during his controversial switch from folk to rock. \u201cBe proud you\u2019re an Indian but be careful who you tell,\u201d he recalls his people advising him. The movie also examines the Indian roots in the work of Mildred Bailey, a pioneer for female jazz singers and a profound influence on some male superstars who came after her, one of whom, Tony Bennett, appears in an interview.  Advertisement And there are heartbreaking stories, especially the one of Jessie Ed Davis, the spectacular guitar player who worked with blues singer Taj Mahal in the \u201960s. Allman Brothers Band member Butch Trucks recently told an interviewer that one reason the band long declined to put a studio recording of its rendition of \u201cStatesboro Blues\u201d on an album was they felt it was just a second-string copy of what Taj and Davis had done on their first album. Davis\u2019 adoption by British rockers led to a high life that unfortunately plunged Davis into junkiedom. Cleaned up, Davis teamed with Native American activist and poet John Trudell for the great \u201cAKA Grafitti Man\u201d project. In the film, Trudell (who was interviewed prior to his own 2015 passing) says of Davis, \u201cHe set me on my way, and then he checked out.\u201d  The movie goes down byways you might not have expected: Taboo from Black Eyed Peas makes an appearance, and heavy metal shows up via both guitarist Steve Salas (one of the movie\u2019s executive producers) and drummer Randy Castillo, who played with Ozzy. Their stories are among the movie\u2019s most moving. Appropriately, \u201cRumble\u201d ends at Standing Rock, North Dakota, with the sight of indigenous people protesting the Keystone pipeline, confronted by faceless authority figures who look ready to beat them down. The struggle continues. \u201cWe\u2019re right and the world is wrong,\u201d as Robertson said he came to believe in the period when he and Bob Dylan were practically getting booed off the stage every night."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "X-Men: First Class", "Review": "The best acting in \"X-Men: First Class\" is by President John F. Kennedy, who in his Thanksgiving 1962 message to the nation, expresses gratitude for the successful end of the Cuban Missile Crisis while suppressing what he surely must know, that American and Soviet missiles spent a great deal of time flying back and forth while mentally controlled by the awesome powers of mutants. The movie's use of the missile crisis certainly serves the purpose of establishing this prequel in the early 1960s and answers a question I've always had: Does the real world overlap with the histories of superheroes? Advertisement The movie is high-tech and well-acted, with lots of action and noise as it portrays the origins of the X-Men, a group of about a dozen mutants (so far). It begins in a Nazi prison camp, where young Erik Lehnsherr is forced to witness a tragedy and finds he can control metals with his mind \u2014 but only when he's angry. He grows up to become Magneto and is played by Michael Fassbender, the lean Irish actor who the buzzmeisters say will become a big star from this film. Heaven help him. He was so good in \"Fish Tank,\" \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"Jane Eyre\" (2011); must he play Magneto to become a star? For that matter, Raven/Mystique is played by Jennifer Lawrence, just nominated for a best actress Oscar. Now she's a blue shape-shifter with scales. The price of stardom. At Oxford, we meet the telepath Charles Xavier (James Mc\u00adAvoy) as a young man before he was paralyzed. He will eventually operate a school to shelter and train mutants, and he dreams they can help the world. His archenemy is Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), Magneto's cruel tormentor in the Nazi camp, now a man who recruits mutants to the dark side, where if they're good, maybe they'll be able to wear a helmet like his and look like a Roman charioteer. If anyone whacks him up alongside the head, he's gonna get a nasty cut from that pointy cheek-protector. Other mutants are gathered into one fold or the other. Each one has a specialty. There is a shape-shifter, a tempest-tosser, a screamer, a fire-blaster, a quick adapter (named Darwin, of course), and so on. That each would develop a unique ability through simultaneous mutation is a tribute to the intelligent design of Stan Lee and his Marvel Comics crew. Still, it must be confining to have only one trick; you need to move with a crowd to cover all the bases. The plot involves attempts by CIA agent Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) to use Xavier to battle Shaw, who presents a threat to world peace. Exactly how the CIA discovered the mutants is a little unclear; indeed the agency exists mostly as a convenience to the plot, and the source of Moira, who seems to really like Xavier \u2014 and as a telepath, he should realize that if anyone does. Advertisement Anyway, the destinies of the good and bad mutants intersect with the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was not quite as we think of it. The scene where the mutants stand on a beach and mentally duel by causing both American and Soviet missiles to shuttle back and forth in the sky is \u2026 hilarious, I was going to say, but no, I should consider this scene more devoutly. Director Matthew Vaughn gave us \"Kick-Ass\" (2010), in which an 11-year-old girl was hammered almost to death for our entertainment. This movie lacks comparable violence, but is louder. At least all the X-Men are old enough to see an R-rated movie without adult supervision. Not that \"X-Men\" is R-rated; god forbid that a comic-book movie should turn away a single eager ticket-buyer. \"X-Men: First Class\" is competent weekend entertainment. It is not a great comic book movie, like \"Spider-Man 2,\" or a bad one, like \"Thor.\" It is not in 3-D, which is a mercy. The actors all embody their roles convincingly, if somewhat humorlessly, and the special effects cope admirably with those rockets changing directions. The battle scenes involve people having terrible things happen to them in somewhat incomprehensible ways, but they also create an intriguing texture for Raven the shape-shifter; Nicholas Hoult as Beast looks as if he's wearing a shag- rug suit, but there you have it."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Walking Out", "Review": "Many of us were told in school that there were seven basic types of stories, and that two of them were \"man vs. nature\" and \"man vs. himself.\" Of course, all good stories ultimately fit into that second category, even if the other ones fit, too. \"Walking Out,\" a wilderness adventure by the sibling filmmaking team of Alex and Andrew Smith, is a fine illustration of this idea. It's about a soft, suburbanized 14-year old named David (Josh Wiggins) who goes deep into the Montana mountains to visit his strong, silent outdoorsman father, Cal (Matt Bomer), then accompanies him on a moose-hunting trip. The expedition goes horribly awry, forcing the boy to discover an inner, primal strength he never imagined he possessed. Advertisement Father and son are estranged, and the difference in their lifestyles divides them further. The boy is such a product of modern civilization that he clings to his phone like a child with a teddy bear. His father mocks him for it, and demands that he leave his phone behind when they head off into the woods for a moose hunt that will require them to live in a hut on a mountain. Things start to go wrong fast, starting with the discovery of the corpse of a moose that was shot and left to decay in\u00a0 a pond by \"tourist\" hunters who lack Cal's respect for ritual.  A chance encounter with a grizzly bear cub leads to a series of mishaps that force David to mature. It's a credit to the movie that this is never depicted as a necessary step for the boy to become a man. We're always aware of the awful weight of the responsibility that's suddenly been placed upon him. It's just not fair.  Shot by Todd McMullen in a series of elegantly composed, super-wide images, edited with a minimalist flair by Michael Taylor, and scored mostly with mournful, contemplative classical string instruments by Ernst Reijseger, this is a meditation on the rituals and tragic weight of masculinity, as passed down from macho fathers to their sons, and by those sons to their sons. The movie would fit nicely in a film festival comprised of works with a similar theme, including \"Legends of the Fall\" and \"The Revenant\" and older wilderness dramas like \"Jeremiah Johnson\" and \"Bend of the River.\" Unfortunately, it's largely devoid of humor. And there are times when it leans too hard on the usual signifiers of Tragic Masculinity\u2014particularly when the soundtrack brings in a holy choir to underscore the holy devotion of son to father, and vice-versa, and whenever Cal launches into philosophical frontiersman mode, explaining the mystical communion of man and nature like a graduate fiction writing student who just got back from a camping trip. Much of the latter appears to have been added by the filmmakers, though you can understand why they thought it was necessary: the source material, a 1988 short story by David Quammen, is light on dialogue and heavy on terse descriptions of people doing things. Advertisement Throughout, Cal tries to bond with David by telling him stories about how his own father (played in flashbacks by Bill Pullman) instructed him in the same manly arts that Cal is passing down now. These scenes are less successful than the present-day material, not just because they kill the sense of immediacy but because the images of young Cal and his father are so eloquent that the narration doesn't really add much to them. This is often the case with the present-day scenes as well, though. The film works best as a simple tale of a \"civilized\" person's immersion in the natural world, conveyed through scenes of physical struggle. The difficulty of survival and the stakes involved in every decision make you realize how naked modern humans are without technology. The closeup of David's face when the ordeal finally ends is suffused with an overwhelming sense of relief."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs", "Review": "\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\" is the best of the three films about our friends in the inter-species herd of plucky prehistoric heroes. And it involves some of the best use of 3-D I've seen in an animated feature. It also introduces a masterstroke that essentially allows the series to take place anywhere: There is this land beneath the surface of the earth, you see... \tWell, if there can be one land, there can be any number of lands, including not only this one, where dinosaurs still roam, but maybe a portal in time leading to the future, or one in space, leading to another planet. We can maybe expect Manny and Ellie in Vegas, or Scrat on Mars. This particular land looks a great deal like a primeval jungle, if such a wilderness had lava falls as well as waterfalls. As it is subterranean, it has sortofa rock roof, although indirect lighting comes from somewhere and sustains lush vegetation. Advertisement \tAll of our friends are back, and some new ones, including a ferocious T-Rex and a sexy rival for Scrat the squirrel, named Scratt\u00e8, accent grave over the \u00e8. As befits this land before time, Scrattand Scratt\u00e8 are sabre-toothed squirrels. No wonder the big teeth died out. They're of more use to a carnivore than a vegetarian. But logic like this is of no use in a movie where Sid the Sloth (voice by John Leguizamo) adopts three dinosaur eggs and plans to raise the babies. \tThat's how they all end up underground in the Hollow Earth, the land Edgar Rice Burroughs name Pellucidar, and I guess with a place like that, you can name it anything you want. The mother dinosaur comes looking for her hatchlings, grabs them and Sid, and disappears under the surface. An all-for-one, one-for-all spirit has grown among our friends, who give chase: Manny and Ellie the woolly mammoths (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah), Diego the saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary), and the possums Eddie and Crash (Josh Peck and Seann William Scott). They meet Buck the Weasel (Simon Pegg), who has an eye patch instead of a peg leg, and is obsessed with his quest for a Great White Dinosaur, unfortunately not named Moby Dino. \tIn the Ice Age films the tiger has learned to coexist with such edible species as sloths and gazelles, but dinosaurs aren't covered by the terms of the truce, and this one is so big it could eat even a wooly mammoth in one chomp. That sets us up for the staple of the series -- chase scenes, involving dizzying falls, catapults into the sky, close shaves and possible digestion. This is pure invention, and unlike the monotonous chase sequences in some family animation, \"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\" is tirelessly inventive visually.  Carlos Saldanha, writer of the 2002 film and co-director of the (disappointing) \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" (2006), is the director this time, and many of his sequences are in the spirit of the brilliant Scratt-and-acorn scene that opened the first \"Ice Age.\" That includes one in which Scrat, Scratt\u00e8 and the acorn are trapped inside floating bubbles, which is no big deal to the acorn. Still, this is a talented acorn, which sings a tune from the Gilbert O'Sullivan songbook to express how alone an acorn must sometimes feel. An acorn that smart, you don't want to eat it all at once. Advertisement \tI thought the 3-D was done well. I remained unconvinced by the process. You have to fool with the glasses, the brightness is dimmed, and so on. But I was surprised how well \"Dawn of the Dinosaurs\" implements it. It creates much less of a distracting superfluous dimension, and more skillfully makes the whole image seem to belong together. The movie is also widely being shown in 2-D, and if you want to save a few bucks, that's the way to go.  Here's a nice bright 2-D scene including the new character Buck: http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/iceagedawnofthedinosaurs/large_clip.html"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Hereafter", "Review": "Clint Eastwood's \"Hereafter\" considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact. I was surprised to find it enthralling. I don't believe in woo-woo, but then neither, I suspect, does Eastwood. This is a film about the afterlife that carefully avoids committing itself on such a possibility. The closest it comes is the idea of consciousness after apparent death. This is plausible. Many near-death survivors report the same memories, of the white light, the waiting figures and a feeling of peace. Advertisement One of the characters seems to have a genuine psychic gift. But is he in fact communicating with people beyond the grave? Some form of telepathy might be possible, and he may simply be receiving what his subjects desire or need to be told by their dead loved ones. He brings nothing from beyond the grave that his clients could not have formed in their living minds. This is a subject that lends itself to sensation and psychic baloney. It's astonishing how many people believe New Age notions, which have the attraction of allowing believers to confer supernormal abilities on themselves and others without the bother of plausibility. Eastwood's film will leave such people vaguely uneasy. It believes most psychics are frauds. It supposes one who seems to be the real thing, but what, exactly, is he real about? This is a film for intelligent people who are naturally curious about what happens when the shutters close. Eastwood tells three primary stories. The stories meet at the end, in one of those coincidences so beloved by multiple-strand movies. Is this possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. A coincidence never is. That's why we notice them. Throughout the film, the characters behave in ways that seem reasonable enough, and possibilities are left open, which is as it should be. We must live the lives we know and not count on anything beyond the horizon. \"Hereafter\" stars Matt Damon as George, a man who sincerely believes he's able to have communication with the dead, but has fled that ability and taken a low-profile job; Cecile de France as Marie, a newsreader on French television; Bryce Dallas Howard as Melanie, a young cooking student with a fearful dark place inside; Richard Kind as a man mourning his wife; and Frankie and George McLaren as twin brothers, one of whom is struck by a truck and killed. I won't describe here the traumatic surprises some of them experience. In the surprises as in everything else, \"Hereafter\" is believable. There are terrifying events, but Eastwood handles them not for sensation but to show how close we all are, at any moment, to oblivion. In the case of Marie, she undergoes the near death experience we often hear reported, with the white light and the figures. Are people in such a state already dead, or are they experiencing visions generated by the human mind in its final shutdown mode?  Advertisement The powers of the Damon character seem to be authentic, although what they prove is hard to say. There is a moment handled with love and delicacy in which he says something that is either true or isn't, but is a kindness either way. When he holds a stranger's hands he experiences a flash of telepathic insight, but the movie never declares that his insights literally come from dead spirits. Eastwood and his actors achieve a tone that doesn't force the material but embraces it: Not dreamlike, but evoking a reverie state. These characters are not hurtling toward the resolution of a plot. There is no \"solution\" to their stories. There are various degrees of solace, or not. They don't punch the dialogue. They lack the certainty to impose themselves. George in particular is reserved and sad, because his power has become a burden to him.  There's a sweet subplot involving Melanie (Howard), who he meets as a partner in a cooking class. She has experienced loss. George doesn't want to enter her mind. He yearns for a normal life. The ability to read minds would be an unbearable curse. The way his gift affects their relationship is stark and poignant. Marie, the newsreader, is played by Cecile de France in such a fresh and likable way that our sympathy is engaged and we understand that whatever happened to her in the first terrifying scene has fundamentally changed her. Frankie McLaren, as the solemn and earnest little boy seeking his dead twin, takes a character that could have been bathetic and makes him simple and transparent. And notice Richard Kind, so affecting as a man who has lost his wife.  \tThe movie is an original screenplay by Peter Morgan; \"The Queen\" (2006). Eastwood told me Morgan doesn't believe in an afterlife. I don't know if Eastwood does, either. His film embodies how love makes us need for there to be an afterlife. It is the film of a man at peace. He has nothing to prove except his care for the living. Incorporates a little wording from my blog entry from the Toronto film festival premiere."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Behemoth", "Review": "\u201cBehemoth\u201d opens with a distant shot of some kind of excavation project. Mechanical shovels and earth-movers sit on ridges of land carved out by other machines and while all is still for a short time, that quiet is torn apart by a loud explosion that sends sheets of dust into the air. Black and red and grey and yellow dust. It\u2019s beautiful, just as the strafing of a tropical shoreline at the opening of \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d was beautiful. Catastrophe seen from afar sometimes looks positively awe-inspiring.  Advertisement This film, directed by Zhao Liang (acclaimed here for his 2009 \u201cPetition\u201d) is a kind of poetic documentary. It\u2019s all images and sounds, no interviews, no talking heads. Its most direct precursor, I suppose, is Werner Herzog\u2019s 1992 \u201cLessons of Darkness,\u201d which looked at the set-afire Kuwait oil fields in the aftermath of the first Iraq War, framing its narrative, such as it was, as that of a science-fiction film. In \u201cBehemoth,\u201d Liang looks at the ecological and human disasters created by greedy government malfeasance through the lens of Western concepts of Heaven and Hell and the Fall. Starting many of his scenes by having a naked man\u2014an Adam\u2014lying on his side in the landscapes Liang shoots, the movie is punctuated by texts that Liang and co-writer Sylvie Blum adapted from Dante\u2019s Inferno. Multiple shots of explosions accompanied on the soundtrack by Tuvan throat singing briefly bring to mind Antonioni\u2019s death-to-the-West ending of \u201cZabriskie Point.\u201d But Liang here is mourning, or reeling back in terror. The mine seen early in the movie yields its contents, which is trucked to a hillside by large trucks that dump it on a stories-high pile. From that pile, smaller trucks take the coal and transport it elsewhere. The site is right next to a verdantly green and lush series of hills where lamb graze and frolic, oblivious to the fact that their paradise is not long for this world.  Liang\u2019s camera\u2014the director shot the movie himself, at, it seems, some considerable risk to his own safety\u2014then descends to beep within mines, then to refineries, where ore is transformed at punishingly high temperatures into steel. He accompanies individual miners and refinery workers to the quarters where they live. They are miserable, barren places where the workers, both male and female, try to scrub the fortified dirt out of their pores before they go to sleep. In the Asian system depicted by Liang, there\u2019s no having-a-beer-with-the-guys break from work. Work, clean, eat a little, and sleep is how it goes. The narration notes, \u201cWhere wealth accumulates and man is uprooted all is decreed by this monster,\u201d the \u201cBehemoth\u201d of the title. The workers only comment with their eyes.  Advertisement The cinematography is matched by the amazing soundtrack, an aural hellscape in which it\u2019s hard to distinguish between diegetic sound and music, or \u201cmusic.\u201d The movie\u2019s haunting finale shows where all this industry winds up. After that, \"Behemoth\" breaks away from its poetic mode and shows some workers from Sichuan huddled in front of a government building, protesting their working conditions. Many of them suffer from pneumoconiosis, a lung disease brought on by breathing in all the beautiful dust that the explosions kick up.  This is a beautiful and harrowing movie, the first of the bad-news-for-humanity documentaries to be released in the states this year. Drink up!"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "I Am Not Your Negro", "Review": "Raoul Peck's \"I Am Not Your Negro\" is a political statement and a deep look into the mind of James Baldwin, one of the 20th century's greatest writers and social critics. It is also an unusual and striking cinematic biography with a specific mission: to show America through the eyes of an African-American, scattering shreds of hope amid horror, exasperation and disgust.\u00a0  The film is built around material that was created largely by its subject (the voice-over narration, read by Samuel L. Jackson, comes from Baldwin's last, unfinished novel), and Peck illustrates much of it with documentary and news footage, vintage photos, news clippings and onscreen text. And yet we don't get all that much imagery of Baldwin himself. This choice might might seem puzzling at first he was, after all, one of the few prominent African-American intellectuals who were regular presences on network TV in the 1960s, and from what little we see of those moments (the highlights include some choice bits from \"The Dick Cavett Show\") it's clear that Peck could have built a satisfying feature just around James Baldwin the camera subject: that's how authoritative he was.  Advertisement But this decision and others make sense as the film unfolds. \"I Am Not Your Negro\" is not interested in giving us the full arc of Baldwin's life. It is mainly interested in presenting how he saw and wrote about the world. And it does it with imagination, sensitivity, and passion tempered by sorrow. The bits of Baldwin's novel that have been turned into narration focus on the 1960s, with the murders of John F. Kennedy, Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. serving as milestones in despair. Along this historical clothesline, Peck strings a series of observations and anecdotes, sly asides and words of wisdom, and tries to reconcile the difference between what the United States says it stands for and what it actually does.  We hear Baldwin's conflicted, evolving reaction to the Civil Rights movement (including the internal debates about violent vs. nonviolent resistance) and interracial relationships (the hero of Baldwin's novel tells a story about how he and his first serious girlfriend, a white girl, used to leave the site of their trysts individually, several minutes apart, then sit far apart from each other on subway cars). Baldwin tells us what he thinks the carefully constructed images of Doris Day, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Ray Charles, Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte reveal about how white Americans see themselves and others. We get his take on mid-century American attitudes towards the Horatio Alger myth (exactly that, a myth), capitalism (a way of putting numbers above all else), mainstream entertainment (a narcotic) and the possibility of reconciliation between the races (slim, unless whites come to grips with the full impact of slavery and Jim Crow). And he treats us to snippets of highly personal film criticism that searches movies for evidence of the mentality of the culture that made it. The highlight is a bit where Baldwin describes a black audience's reaction to the scene in Stanley Kramer's interracial buddy movie \"The Defiant Ones,\" where Tony Curtis' white chain gang inmate falls off a train and Poitier's character leaps off to help him: the crowd yelled at Poitier, \"What are you doing?\"  Peck miscaculates, I think, in lifting us out of the 20th century and linking many of Baldwin's observations about his own time to events and cultural developments that occurred after his death. Mixed in with the historical footage and photos and the scenes from old movies are bits from trashy daytime talk shows and reality TV shows, and images that allude to the financial meltdown of 2008, the Ferguson uprising, Barack Obama's election, and the presidential campaign of 2016. These elements don't damage the movie too terribly. But they do break the spell Peck weaves. And there are times when the present-tense stuff diminishes the timelessness of Baldwin's observations by connecting them too bluntly to American life in the second decade of the new millennium. Like Baldwin's writing, this movie will always be relevant, and yet here it is, dating itself.  Advertisement No matter: Baldwin's voice as a writer comes through powerfully anyway. It was wise to have Jackson read Baldwin's words plainly in his own voice, rather than attempt an impersonation. This decision shines a spotlight on the work, which is where the spotlight should always be in a movie about an artist. And it draws intuitive but general connections between Baldwin's life and Baldwin's fictionalization of it, without making any claims that the text itself can't support.  Turning Baldwin into a chorus and occasionally a bystander in a story drawn from his own experience proves to be a masterstroke as well. Baldwin is bearing witness in the narration, and Peck turns him into a witness onscreen, too, briefly putting up pictures of Baldwin alongside politicians and artists but never holding them for long, and locating Baldwin within photo montages of important, sorrowful events (such as King's funeral), establishing that he was there but never privileging his grief over the grief of others. This is not a portrait of one man, James Baldwin, but of the nation he wrote about, as seen through his eyes. It's a film that bears witness to a writer bearing witness."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Tru Loved", "Review": "Ebert's follow-up: \"Definitely read me second\"   Following is a new review of \"Tru Loved,\u201d which I have viewed from beginning to end. First comes the original, unaltered, 10/17/08 review, written after I had viewed eight minutes of the film. After the [ * * * * ] you will find the complete film reviewed.

Advertisement \"Tru Loved\" as a movie is on about the same level as a not especially good high school play. Student directors could learn from it. I'm sure its heart is in the right place, but it fails at fundamentals we take for granted when we go to the movies. By lacking them, it illustrates what the minimum requirements are for a competent film. Yes, you can clearly see and hear them, especially when they're missing. 1. Line readings. That's what they sound like, readings. Classroom readings. The actors lack the knack of making their dialogue sound spontaneous and realistic. They sound like bright English students who have memorized their lines but find themselves onstage without having had much experience or training. 2. Body language. One of the first things an actor learns is not to gesture as a way of emphasizing lines unless the lines really call for it. Insecure actors often seem to punch up dialogue physically as a sort of insurance policy. 3. Framing. When you have five characters at a picnic table, you don't (necessarily) want to block those on the other side with the bodies of those on this side. There are ways to do that or fudge it. Or forget it. But don't have those on Side A separated so we can see those on Side B centered between persons 1 and 2, and 2 and 3, and then in the reverse shot, separate those on Side B so we can see those on Side A. 4. Don't let the dialogue scream, \"I paid attention in Gay Lit class!\" When a kid comes home from Walt Whitman High School, don't make a point of establishing a lesbian connection to a name. Grandmother: Tru? What kind of a name is that? Lodell: Short for Gertrude. As in Stein? She's a writer. Grandma: I know who Gertrude Stein was. \"A rose is a rose is a rose.\" Lodell: Yeah. Whatever.  After bringing up the sainted Gertrude, why does Lodell immediately reject her? \"Whatever\" when used by a teenager to an adult is a way of dismissing what has been said. Lodell is a bright kid. Since he has just now come from a class studying \"Romeo and Juliet,\" maybe he might have replied, \"And by any other name would smell as sweet as sweet as sweet.\" Grandma seems as if she'd like that. Advertisement 5. Daydreams. Can be annoying, especially when absurdly stagy. Even more especially when the daydreams are in soft focus and then we cut frequently to the heroine in sharp focus, looking at scenes in her own daydreams and nodding and smiling. 6. Speech patterns. It's my impression most gay men do not \"sound like gay men.\" But we all know exactly what I mean by sounding like gay men. The other side of the rule is: Many men who sound gay are gay, and in many cases, intend to sound gay. Don't get all homophilic on me. You know I'm right. 7. Cameo appearances. Their use must be carefully controlled to avoid breaking a film's mood with the Hey! There's Donald Trump! Syndrome. That is doubly true when the cameo star is famous and appears in a double role, as does Bruce Vilanch, from \"Hollywood Squares.\" Here he plays \"Daniel\" and \"The Minister.\" Senator, I know Bruce Vilanch, and he's no Minister. 8. Music. Not necessary to blast in with literal and urgent punch lines and transitions. The movie is about how Tru moves from idyllic San Francisco to \"conservative\rsuburbia\" with her lesbian mothers. This just in: Except for some jocks and those who doth protest too much, today's suburban teens are mostly cool with people who are gay, except those residing in the Palin Belt. Full disclosure. I lifted the words \"San Francisco to conservative suburbia with her lesbian mothers\" straight from the plot summary on IMDb.com, because I stopped watching the movie at the 00:08.05 point. IMDb is also where I found out about Bruce Vilanch's dual role. I never did see the lesbian mothers or my friend Bruce. For \"Tru Loved,\" the handwriting was on the wall. The returns were in. The case was closed. You know I'm right. Or tell me I'm wrong. Q. How can you give a one-star rating to a movie you didn't sit through?  Advertisement A. The rating only applies to the first eight minutes. After that, you're on your own.   * * * * \t\u201cTru Loved,\u201d is a parable about how things should change in a world with intolerance for gays. If you agree with its message, I understand that you hope it will be seen by the people who might benefit from the film. They will, of course, not see it. It is preaching to the choir. \tAll they need is Google to discover it is about a high school girl with two gay moms and two gay dads, a high school jock in the closet, a high school straight guy with a beloved gay uncle he calls his dad, an effort to start a Gay-Straight Alliance at the school, and an English teacher who thinks he is in the closet but is informed by a fellow teacher and friend: \"If you were doused in kerosene and set on fire you still couldn't be any more flaming than you are, every single day.\" Not many homophobes are likely to think, \"Hmmm. Sounds like a movie I need to see, to cure me of my bigotry.\" \t\"Tru Loved,\" I can only conclude, is destined to be seen largely at gay/lesbian film festivals. A comment on my blog came from a member of the screening committee for such a festival, who said it was selected over her or his dead body. If the film has a future, it will be as camp. I received a letter recently from a woman who went to see \"The Exorcist\" at a gay-oriented theater in New York and was not pleased to discover it came complete with an emcee in drag and an audience of cut-ups prepared to laugh. Although I see nothing remotely camp about \"The Exorcist,\" I think that theater might do boffo box-office business with \"Tru Love.\" \tI have the impression that a great many gay people are intelligent, have excellent taste, and don't think a movie is automatically good simply because it contains a message they believe in. Perhaps I live in an elitist world, but the gay people I know don't have time to lose at simplistic True Believer films. On the other hand they, and anyone else, could feel deeply moved by a film like \"Longtime Companion.\" \tI have this notion of  Clangs  in movies. A  Clang  is a moment that breaks the fabric of a film with something that is impossible, illogical, tone-deaf, out of character, amateurish, or otherwise goes  Clang!  I looked again at the first eight minutes of \"Tru Love\" and then at all the rest of it, and noted a few  Clangs!  Advertisement \tLodell (Matthew Thompson) is a closeted gay African-American high school quarterback at Walt Whitman High who hopes that if he dates Tru (Najarra Townsend) he will appear straight to his buddies. At a point when he has not yet disclosed his sexuality to Tru, they are discussing gay and straight and she makes a statement about herself that seems ambivalent. Lo says, \"You tryin' to tell me that YOU'RE gay?\"  Clang!  He should have said, \"You tryin' to tell me that you're GAY?\" \tWhen he says people in \"his world\" are simply not gay, she asks, what about James Baldwin, Langston Hughes and Bayard Rustin? He knows who they all are. Unusual for most high school students, I suspect. Those three were indeed not of his world, and lived and died before the phrase \"on the down low\" was coined. A muted  Clang.  \tLo wants Tru to be what is called in crime a \"beard.\" She interprets: He wants her to be his Katie Holmes. I dunno. I have no reason to believe that Tom Cruise is gay, except maybe for the time he used Oprah's couch as a trampoline, but since she brought it up, isn't his private life none of our beeswax? \tThe football team has a rabidly homophobe coach (Vernon Wells), who calls his players \"ladies,\" screams \"You can do better than that!\" and advises them to \"go meet your boy friends at the Fag Scouts of America!\" This coach is no Woody Hayes. His \"practices\" seem to consist of laid-back games of touch football and tossin' the ball around. Why doesn't he, or anyone else, realize that he has an Australian accent?  Clang!  \tTru meets a straight guy named Trevor (Jake Abel) at the first meeting of the Gay-Straight Alliance. Before asking her out he says, \"Don't you have a boy friend or something?\" Hello? How big is the high school if Trevor hasn't seen her with the star quarterback? Okay, let's drop the  Clangs.  They're getting annoying. \tShe begins, \"There's no easy way to explain this.\" He turns away and sighs.  Sighs?  Wouldn't he keep looking at her and remain silent? \"It's important for people to think we're a couple.\" The light dawns. \"Ooohhh,\" he says. \"I'm starting to get the picture. You're his Katie Holmes!\" Memes travel fast. Advertisement \tHer mothers have set a curfew. She\u2019s late. She rushes in. Camera POV shows both mothers from behind, already posed, standing side-by-side with Tru framed neatly between them. She says of Travor: \"I thought he was gay, but he\u2019s a gay-acting straight boy.\" FWIW, I don't think he acts gay. But people in this movie have fast-acting, long distance gaydar. When she calls her dads in San Francisco and tells them of her date with Lo, it takes them two questions for one to conclude: \"He's gay, gayer, gayest.\" Hey, I just got Lo's name: He's living on the down low, right? Since \"Tru\" is obvious, their names represent his choices. \tDid I skip over the makeout session between Tru and Trevor in a parked car? Tru is lip-smackin' good. By that I mean we can hear their kisses as they smack loudly. I've kissed a fair number of girls and you could never hear us smacking. I've seen a fair number of kisses in the movies, and can't remember anyone smacking. After 15 seconds, Tru pulls away: \"I'm thrilled you're hetero, but you don't need to prove it on your first date.\" Said in real life? Not often. He presses his case: \"Can I please just feel you up?\" This is a question that is usually asked in body language, not words.\" Your ol' dad here has copped a fair number of feels in his lifetime, and he never asked first. Sometimes he sure shoulda, but you live and learn. \tAt the second GSA meeting, Tru asks everybody to give their name: \"If you don't feel comfortable, you can make one up.\" Hello? Again, how big is this high school? Wouldn't the gays brave enough to attend a GSA meeting already sorta know each other, or am I naive? Tru poses for a photo for the Whitman High Weekly, which more or less ends her days as a Katie. Lo is confronted with the photo by his gay-hating friends and lies that he was only dating Tru because \"She didn't want people to know she was a lesbian.\" In close-up he makes one of those  Please go along with me on this!  faces toward her. From the establishing shot we know that every one of his friends is clearly able to see this secret appeal. Advertisement \tTru visits Lo's home unannounced and is asked by his suspicious grandmother (who doesn't like him dating white girls), \"That boy didn\u2019t get you in trouble, did he?\" The movie's timeline is murky, but in terms of subjective screen time I estimate this question comes three days after their first date--four, tops. Grandmother perhaps should remember that a girl doesn't suspect she has an extra passenger on board only four days after impregnation. \tThere is a fraught confrontation in a tree house. Bird cries are louder than the dialog. Sounds like about the same bird cry, but birds do that. Soon there is a wedding between the two moms, presided over by a minister who was ordained on the internet. This is Bruce Vilach. I was wrong to believe IMDb that he has a dual role in the movie. The uncle and the minister are one and the same. But I was right to speculate that in any role Vilanch would be instantly recognizable and perform the  Look! There's Donald Trump! function of a celebrity cameo. Give my friend Bruce credit for a wardrobe change. He switches from an orange T-shirt under a Hawaiian shirt to another T-shirt, in proper clerical black, with a scarf doing service as an emergency chausible. \tLo's treacherous friend Manny tells the homophobic coach that Lo is attending a gay wedding. How could Manny possibly know? It's highly unlikely Lo told him. Manny and the coach crash through the garden gate at the wedding. Manny hits Lo in the jaw. Lo falls to the ground. Coach bellows: \"Do you mean to tell me that I've got a queer for a quarterback?\" He starts to leave. Asks Manny, \"Manny, you coming?\" Manny, who has just tried to break Lo's jaw, replies: \"He's my best friend, coach.\" \tThis is where the English teacher is told by his friend that if he were doused in kerosene, etc. As his way of confirming that diagnosis, he immediately criticizes the cut of her dress. Lo had told Tru he couldn't attend the wedding because he's living on the down low, but as you know, he turned up, and now, asked to sing a song, he has conveniently has brought along his sheet music. \tCould you hear the soft offstage  Clangs?  The problem with a  Clang  is that it pulls you up to the surface and makes you think about the movie when you should be feeling the story. That's not good. \tThe film is however likely to be encouraging and appealing to its primary audience, which I believe may be younger gay teenagers. The actors all have to deal with roles that are under- or over-written, and with characters that are one-dimensional stereotypes (the coach, the grandmother, both gay dad parents). The most important character in the film is Lodell, and he is also the most convincingly written. The actor Matthew Thompson cou3ld have benefitted by firmer direction and saved from some wayward line readings, but he has an appealing screen presence, and in the right films could become a young star. Advertisement \tNow allow me to slow down here. A good number of my blog commenters pointed out that I picked on a small indie film. They are right, and I wish I hadn't. I discuss this in the new blog entry posted today, \"Definitely read me second!\" Here I want to observe that it's a miracle any film gets made. Millions of tiny pieces have to come together. It takes courage and resolve to pull it off, especially on a limited budget. Stewart Wade, the writer and director of \"Tru Loved,\" has achieved that miracle. Attention must be paid. * * * * Read Ebert's blog post about this review, and join the discussion, here: http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/10/dont_read_me_first.html"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Victoria & Abdul", "Review": "Brit wit Stephen Fry\u00a0once said of Judi Dench, \"Railings should be built around her so that all may admire her in an orderly and respectful fashion.\" No need to fence in this glorious dame. It\u2019s far better to simply let Dench loose across a worthy cinematic expanse, judging by her mostly silent yet resoundingly brilliant early moments in \u201cVictoria & Abdul.\u201d This sturdy regal period piece provides a perfect opportunity to properly adore the 82-year-old legend as she revisits the role of Queen Victoria two decades after first playing the indomitable monarch in \u201cMrs. Brown.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement The occasion is the Golden Jubilee celebration held in 1887 to salute her 50 years of rule over the British Empire. After all the royal celebrants in a cavernous dining hall are seated, Her Majesty\u2014a pudgy figure attired in a heavy black gown that droops like a curtain over her ample backside\u2014slowly waddles her way to the head of a table. Her joyless face is as shriveled and sour as an ancient grapefruit as she wordlessly goes about the ritual as swiftly as possible. As the first course is served, she shovels soup into her mouth at such a rapid pace that liquid sloppily cascades down her chin. Later, she swiftly gnaws through a poultry course like a ravenous lawn mower before sneaking in a cat nap before dessert. Meanwhile, protocol requires that once she is done with a dish, others must cease eating as well. But Victoria\u2019s frown is soon turned upside down when two of her Indian subjects, uprooted from their colonized homeland for the occasion, present her with a ceremonial coin. Both have been warned to not look directly at the queen and Mohammed (Adeel Akhtar, who emits an amusing Paul Giamatti level of disgruntlement), the older and squatter of the pair, follows the rules. But Abdul (Ali Fazal), tall, youthful and quite attractive with a merry twinkle in his eye, can\u2019t help but gaze upon and smile at this lonely old woman. Suddenly, he bends down and kisses her foot. And, just like that, a bolt of mutual affection passes between the queen and the stranger who is about to become her closest companion during the waning years of her reign. That\u2019s when director Stephen Frears, who did so well by Dench with \u201cPhilomena,\u201d finally flashes\u2014ta da\u2014\u201cVictoria & Abdul\u201d upon the screen. Those who have seen \u201cMrs. Brown,\u201d the source of Dench\u2019s first of seven (to date) Oscar nominations, will be familiar with Victoria\u2019s relationship with another commoner, Scotsman John Brown (played with robust cheekiness by Billy Connolly), after her beloved consort Prince Albert died. Their connection was more a meeting of the minds as her horse-riding partner would challenge her in a way that others did not dare.\u00a0 Most of her advisers treat the aging queen as an obstruction they are forced to indulge, especially eldest son Bertie (a frazzled Eddie Izzard, exasperation incarnate) who is anxious to be king. But what bonds the now-grandmotherly Victoria and Abdul, who has an elegiac way of speaking and viewing the world, is how he approaches her as a human being with feelings and not as an intimidating institution. He also serves as a conduit to India, a part of her kingdom that she is forbidden to visit since a fatwa has been placed on her head. His enchanting description of the Taj Mahal in his hometown of Agra leads her to build an elaborate Indian-themed Durbar meeting room in her seaside house on the Isle of Wight complete with ornate white ceiling, imported rugs and peacock throne. Advertisement The script by Lee Hall (\u201cBilly Elliot\u201d)\u2014\u201cbased on real events\u2014mostly,\u201d we are told\u2014smartly allows moviegoers to discover along with Victoria just who this mysterious charmer actually is. Abdul appears to be forthright but will eventually be shown to be prone to omitting inconvenient truths about his past as need be. Initially, he is promoted to a kind of personal assistant. But as he helps the queen with her daily correspondences, she learns this onetime clerk at a prison is a Muslim and requests that he schools her in his native tongue of Urdu as well as in the Koran. When she learns the word for teacher is \u201cmunshi,\u201d Victoria declares that will now be Abdul\u2019s official position. As the queen grows ever fonder of and more reliant on her new soulmate, tensions rise among those in her inner circle including Michael Gambon as Prime Minister Lord Salisbury, Olivia Williams as Baroness Churchill and Paul Higgins as Dr. Reid, the queen\u2019s personal physician. Race, class and out-sized privilege definitely play a role in stoking their shared resentment of being pushed aside by this foreign outsider to the point that an out-right mutiny is eventually threatened. The costumes, the gorgeous real-life settings and interiors, the just-right lighting, the music\u2014all technical aspects are handled precisely. But if there is a problem with \u201cVictoria & Abdul,\u201d it exists within the imbalance between the movie\u2019s titular twosome. While Fazal is well suited for his role physically and acquits himself as best as he can, there is no way he can come close to keeping up with Dench in the acting department. It is as if a cloud is pitted against a boulder.\u00a0 Despite that weakness, there are multiple pleasures to be had by witnessing a powerful, still-vital woman finding unexpected late-life joy of the platonic variety. Sure to bring a smile to anyone\u2019s face is when Victoria and Abdul journey to romantic Florence, where Puccini himself (Simon Callow) sings for the queen and her entourage. In fact, the ruler returns the favor by straining to warble Gilbert & Sullivan\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Called Little Buttercup.\u201d Much like this often-endearing portrait of an odd-couple relationship, it is a little off-key but well worth the experience.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter", "Review": "\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" is without a doubt the best film we are ever likely to see on the subject \u2014 unless there is a sequel, which is unlikely, because at the end, the Lincolns are on their way to the theater. It's also a more entertaining movie than I remotely expected. Yes, Reader, I went expecting to sneer. The story opens with young Abe witnessing the murder of his mother by a vampire. He swears vengeance, and some years later is lucky to be getting drunk while standing at a bar next to Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who coaches him on vampire-killing and explains that it is a high calling, requiring great dedication and avoiding distractions like marriage.  Advertisement There's an early scene in which Lincoln tries to shoot a vampire, but that won't work because they're already dead. Then whatever can he do? \"Well,\" he tells Henry, \"I used to be pretty good at rail-splitting\u2026\" This line drew only a few chuckles from the audience, because the movie cautiously avoids any attempt to seem funny.\u00a0 Lincoln's weapon of choice becomes an axe with a silver blade, which he learns to spin like a drum major's baton. That he carries this axe with him much of the time may strike some as peculiar. I was reminded uncannily of Buford Pusser, walking tall and carrying a big stick. Against Henry's advice, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) marries Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and the story moves quickly to his days in the White House, where he discovers that the vampires are fighting on the side of the South. This seems odd, since they should be equal opportunity bloodsuckers, but there you have it. Still with him his childhood friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie), a free black man whose mistreatment helped form Lincoln's hatred of slavery. Also still at his side is Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), who hired him in his Springfield general store; Johnson and Speed join Lincoln in Civil War strategy sessions and are his principal advisers, roles overlooked by history. The film, directed by Timur Bekmambetov and written by Seth Grahame-Smith, based on his novel, handles all these matters with an admirable seriousness, which may be the only way they could possibly work. The performances are earnest and sincere, and even villains like Adam (Rufus Sewell), the American leader of the Vampire Nation, doesn't spit or snarl over much. It regrettably introduces but does not explain Vadoma (Erin Wasson), a statuesque woman who is several decades ahead of time in her taste for leather fetish wear. Are vampires kinky? I didn't know. Advertisement Although we do not attend \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" in search of a history lesson, there's one glitch I cannot overlook. In the first day of fighting at Gettysburg, the Union sustains a defeat so crushing that Lincoln is tempted to surrender. This is because the Confederate troops, all vampires, are invulnerable to lead bullets, cannon fire and steel blades, and have an alarming way of disappearing and rematerializing. Over breakfast, Lincoln confides his despair to his wife and says conventional weapons are of no more use against them than \u2014 why \u2014 than this fork! As he stares at it, he realizes it is silver, and vampires can be killed by silver weapons, as he has proved with his axe-twirling. Now try not to focus too much on the timeline. After his realization, Lincoln mobilizes all resources to gather wagonloads of silver in Washington, melt it, and manufacture silver bayonets, bullets and cannon balls. Then we see him, Johnson and Speed on board a weapons train en route to Gettysburg. It is night again, so apparently all of this took less than a day. Never mind. What comes now is a genuinely thrilling action sequence in which the vampires battle with Lincoln and his friends on top of the speeding train, which hurtles toward a high wooden bridge that has been set alight by the sinister Vadoma (pronounced \"Vadooma,\" I think). This sequence is preposterous and yet exciting, using skillful editing and special effects. Somehow Benjamin Walker and his co-stars here are even convincing \u2014 well, as convincing as such goofiness could possibly be. \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" has nothing useful to observe about Abraham Lincoln, slavery, the Civil War or much of anything else. Blink and you may miss the detail that Harriet Tubman's Underground Railway essentially won the war for the North. But the film doesn't promise insights on such subjects. What it achieves is a surprisingly good job of doing justice to its title, and treating Lincoln with as much gravity as we can expect, under the circumstances."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Don't Worry Baby", "Review": "Dramedy \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Baby\u201d may not be all that memorable, but the premise sure is: A guy might be the biological father of his own father\u2019s illegitimate child with another woman. It\u2019s the Tribeca version of a \u201cMaury\u201d episode, dressed up with Millennial malaise and upper class mid-life crises, as told with an overly straight face and wholesale indie presentation. Debut writer/director Julian Branciforte eventually loses control of his tricky pitch, especially as his generic vision can't support the story with a distinct tone.\u00a0 Advertisement The film does have a narrative economy, covering a great deal of territory in the first 15-20 minutes. We meet a budding photographer named Robert (John Magaro, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d), who is rejecting offers from his distant father, Harry (Christopher McDonald), to work for him. The night after a photo shoot, Robert meets a woman his age named Sara-Beth (Dreama Walker), they come back to his apartment together and\u2014boom\u2014the story jumps to four years later. A lot has changed: Robert's photography dreams have dissipated, and he now works at his dad\u2019s prestigious downtown preschool; Harry has just enrolled Mason, his illegitimate daughter, into the class that Robert is overseeing. Robert soon meets the mother, and is shocked when it\u2019s Sara-Beth. The math of conception is soon performed, and after realizing that he could be the father instead of Harry, a paternity test is taken, to their equal contention. From this point, the movie merely follows them around as they wait for the results, while they both sneakily vie for Sara-Beth and share time with Mason.\u00a0 \"Don't Worry Baby\"'s perspective on this saga is appropriately unusual. It sidesteps the bizarreness of the situation by placing characters in a shared air of acceptance, but feels too light with the new, life-changing developments that await. Branciforte invests time in the dour headspace of possible-dad Robert, but there\u2019s little dramatic tension. The animosity is clear in the fine chemistry between Magaro and McDonald, especially as disheveled Robert doesn\u2019t believe that estranged dad Harry deserves a second chance, but Branciforte ultimately fails to make us care about paternity test results. Dreama Walker has too little of a character to work with, despite playing the woman who gave birth to this contested child; Harry's ex-wife Miriam (Talia Balsam) tries to normalize the scenario by eye-rolling through her ex-husband getting a younger woman pregnant, but her response too feels idealized.\u00a0By being so hands-off about its tense topics, a whole gender seems muted, and the movie fails to communicate an awareness beyond its macho showdown.\u00a0 Branciforte's writing lacks the nuance to take its absurd concept seriously, so it awkwardly injects comedy. It\u2019s often too broad, as when Robert\u2019s comic relief roommate Lenny (Tom Lipinski) is brought in as a playful nuisance, as if he came from a different dimension. Fights between Robert and Harry also fall flat (like when they\u2019re both in the car with Sara-Beth, trying to woo her), lacking the sharp tongue that could make the emotional screwball underneath this plot resonate.\u00a0 By the end, Branciforte answers the 15-minutes-in question of \u201cWTF?\u201d with a unique, warm sensibility about the non-nuclear family unit. It\u2019s a fondness that recalls other domestic storytellers, from Hirokazu Kore-eda to Adam Sandler, who offer distinct takes on unique family situations. Whether completely downplaying it (like Kore-eda) or playing it way up (like Sandler), there\u2019s little life to be found somewhere in the middle.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Hitchcock/Truffaut", "Review": "In 1962, film critic and French New Wave director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut sat down with Alfred Hitchcock to record a week-long interview about Hitchcock\u2019s entire body of work. These sessions beget \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut,\u201d a book whose raison d'\u00eatre was to show American critics that they were underestimating the cinematic richness of Hitchcock\u2019s work. At the time, Hitchcock had been deemed a director of entertaining movies, lacking substance and importance. Despite his fifth directing Oscar nod for \u201cPsycho,\u201d Hitchcock was mainly seen as a director for the unwashed masses of general audiences. Truffaut aimed to fix that, and the resulting book is a master class in the fine art of directing, filled with photographs and the Master of Suspense\u2019s candid observations of his oeuvre. Since its first edition published in 1966, \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut\u201d has been a staple and a fixture of any cinephile\u2019s bookshelf. Advertisement Fast-forward to 2015, where film critic and documentarian Kent Jones brings us the movie version of this essential book. Jones\u2019 take on \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut\u201d is equal parts adaptation, CliffsNotes guide and commentary by a slew of directors influenced by Hitchcock\u2019s work. The film is also a completely entertaining and informative gift to movie lovers, a work constructed with care, humor and insight. Though Hitchcock made his last movie (\u201cFamily Plot\") 40 years ago, he continues to influence in an almost transparent manner. Hitchcock is in the air that today\u2019s directors breathe, and \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut\u201d aims to remind us of this fact. Jones supplements his film clips and interviews with audio from the original 27 hours of interview recordings (17 hours of which are available online). We hear Hitchcock discuss, in directorial terms, movies such as \u201cSabotage,\u201d \u201cVertigo\u201d and \u201cThe Lodger.\u201d We also hear Truffaut describing a scene from \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d as a follow-up to Hitch\u2019s description of \u201csuspense vs. surprise.\u201d\u00a0This is one of the most interesting passages in the film, a moment where the interviewer and the subject exchange places, comparing notes as footage of Truffaut\u2019s film plays onscreen. Throughout \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut,\u201d one gets the feeling that the visual nature of directing forces a filmmaker to deal with his or her obsessions, explicitly or implicitly. \u201cIf you think you can hide your prurient interests as a director, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d says David Fincher, one of several directors testifying before the camera. Fincher marvels at how blatantly Hitchcock expressed his own psychological traumas and aforementioned interests, several of which revolved around fear and sex. The famous story of how Hitchcock\u2019s father had him locked up by Scotland Yard as a child is recounted here, and Hitchcock\u2019s description of Kim Novak\u2019s famous transformation scene in \u201cVertigo\u201d has a frank sexuality that\u2019s as accurate as it is racy.\u00a0In James Gray\u2019s opinion, this scene contains \u201cthe greatest shot in the history of cinema.\u201d Advertisement \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut\u201d spends a fair amount of time on \u201cVertigo\u201d, which isn\u2019t surprising given that film\u2019s current placement atop the Sight and Sound list. Paul Schrader calls it \u201ca forbidden document.\u201d Martin Scorsese discusses how difficult it was to get a copy of the film screened back in the '60s, as Hitchcock\u2019s films were looked at with scorn and derision by the art theaters of the day.\u00a0Since the film was not a success upon first run, Hitchcock sounds a bit reserved when talking about the film; people didn\u2019t discuss their flops back then. \u201cYou have a problem with it?\u201d asks Truffaut. Hitchcock responds that he took issue with \u201cthe hole in the story\u201d regarding the murderer. This is an interesting contrast to his view on the numerous plot holes in hits like \u201cNorth by Northwest.\" \u201cI have this saying,\u201d he tells Truffaut in regard to those who complain about implausibility: \u201cLogic is dull.\u201d Throughout \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut\u201d, Jones gives us delicious quotes from the interview. \"'The Lodger' is the first movie where I exercised any style,\"\u00a0says the man who started out in silent movies when he was 23. Before directing, Hitchcock wrote dialogue titles and used his engineering background to draw and layout scenes. Truffaut suggests that those who started out as silent film directors know something that those who started out in the sound era will never know. The lack of sound forced a purer evocation of the cinema as a visual medium. \u201cYou can watch a Hitchcock movie with the sound off,\u201d we\u2019re told, \u201cand you\u2019ll still be able to follow it.\u201d This notion extends to the use of the suspense element for which Hitchcock is most known. The visuals transcend the language barrier. \u201cThe Japanese audience should scream at the same time the Indian audience does,\u201d Hitchcock says. Jones uses a Tippi Hedren scene from \u201cThe Birds\u201d to supplement Hitchcock\u2019s discussion on how he uses space and an actor\u2019s place within it to heighten tension, bringing out a particular element that I hadn\u2019t noticed in the numerous times I\u2019d seen the film. \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut\u201d offers a lot of ideas to contemplate and discuss, especially if you\u2019re a lover of Hitchcock\u2019s works. Its most intriguing takeaway is a question Hitchcock posed to Truffaut. In so many words, he wonders if he should have experimented more with characters and if he had become \u201ca prisoner of my own form.\u201d It\u2019s a fascinating question, one I carried with me after I left the theater. Wisely, Jones doesn\u2019t provide any answers, for there isn\u2019t a definitive one to be had. Instead, he gives us David Fincher\u2019s quote that \u201cthere was a set of rules, and Hitchcock broke them all.\u201d Advertisement One interview subject you might be expecting is missing from \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut.\" Brian De Palma declined to appear in the film, but he had a good reason. He was busy sitting with Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow for their one-man interview/documentary, \"De Palma.\" That film, which is also quite good, would make a great double feature with \u201cHitchcock/Truffaut.\" Both films feature a director talking to another director about his body of work. The similarities are complementary, and I can think of no better way to waste an afternoon if you love movies."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Kill Team", "Review": "\"War is dirty. It\u2019s not how they portray it in movies,\" says one of the American soldiers convicted of war crimes in the superb, wrenching documentary \"The Kill Team.\" While the remark touches on the psychological realities that led several GIs to murder defenseless Afghan villagers \"for sport,\" as news accounts frequently put it, it also says something about the unique value of non-fiction films in treating fraught subjects like this.To be sure, Hollywood movies about American soldiers at war have remained fairly consistent, the challenging complexities of outliers such as Oliver Stone\u2019s \"Platoon\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July\" notwithstanding. In depicting America\u2019s recent Middle East wars, movies such as \"The Hurt Locker\" and \"Lone Survivor\" typically foreground the sensory onslaught of combat and the heroism of individual GIs. Deeply incriminating moral acts, and of course the morality of the wars themselves, largely go untreated.While \"The Kill Team\" does not directly address the justness or necessity (or lack thereof) of the ongoing Afghanistan conflict, America\u2019s longest war, it offers a deep, troubling probe into a military culture that both incubates horrifically criminal acts against innocents and throws innumerable obstacles in the paths of soldiers who would thwart or report those outrages. In other words, though this is a story of enormous cultural importance and dramatic power, it\u2019s virtually impossible to imagine today\u2019s Hollywood making a movie about it.Yet even if some smart indie filmmaker treated it, audiences today might well suspect a degree of bias or distortion in the process of converting fact into drama. That\u2019s where the special properties of nonfiction come in. While director-cinematographer Dan Krauss and his collaborators, producer Linda Davis and editor Lawrence Lerew, obviously shape \"The Kill Team\" from their own perspectives, the people they show us (and let us hear) are the case\u2019s actual protagonists, which allows us to assay the truth of their accounts from the smallest details of their gestures, intonations and self-presentation.The man for whom this is most important, and who strikes this reviewer as entirely, achingly credible, is a young soldier named Adam Winfield. With the open, ingenuous countenance of a typical American kid raised in good family circumstances, Winfield grew up aching to join the military and did so at age 17. He shipped off to Afghanistan thinking of the U.S. military in terms of honor, integrity and valor, expecting that he would help his own country as well as the Afghanis in what he did there.What he found was a nightmarish reversal of those expectations. The platoon to which he was assigned was dominated by a hulking alpha-male sergeant named Gibbs, who served in Iraq prior to Afghanistan, bore skull tattoos that supposedly represented his human kills, and collected his victims\u2019 finger bones saying he intended to make a necklace out of them. Gibbs organized the platoon\u2019s \"kill teams,\" which went into villages, planted a weapon near an unsuspecting villager so that they could claim he was an enemy, and then gunned him down in cold blood\u2014after which came the ritual taking of trophy photos wherein the grinning GIs moronically pointed to or desecrated their slaughtered quarry. (These awful images became trial evidence and news-media fodder.)The first time Adam Winfield witnessed one of these atrocities, the victim was a 15-year-old boy, and Winfield later recalled the unstinting weeping of the kid\u2019s father and brother. The second victim was an older man whose wife stuck in Winfield\u2019s memory: \"That scream from that woman\u2026I\u2019d never heard anything like it before, the sheer grief.\" Meanwhile, Gibbs came up to Winfield with a big grin and a thumbs-up, and, back at the base, the killers were hailed as \"made men\" and treated to back-slapping and high-fives.Horrified as soon as he understood what the kill team was up to, Winfield was in a dilemma about what to do. He communicated with his dad back in Florida, and, Chris Winfield, a former military man himself, launched into a long, fevered campaign of calling every responsible person he could think of; but virtually everywhere, including the offices of chaplains, he left messages and got no return calls. In Afghanistan, Gibbs and his kill-team cohorts told Adam they would kill him if he breathed a word of their activities to higher-ups. Adam resolved to keep these matters to himself for the short time till his tour of duty was up. But before that happened the kill team took him on another mission and enlisted his participation in the third kill he witnessed. He says he aimed his gun away from the man, but the man died in any case, and Adam not only felt agonizingly responsible afterwards, he was also held to account. Ironically, the truth about the kill teams only came out after another soldier complained about Gibbs and his cohorts\u2019 hash-smoking. Where Adam had expected to go home and turn whistle-blower as soon as he could, he was charged with first-degree murder, along with Gibbs and others.Filmmaker Krauss got involved with the case when Adam was on trial, and was able to film the soldier\u2019s deliberations with his parents and his defense attorney, discussions that involve torturous decisions about possible pleas and potential sentences up to and including life in prison. Expertly structured and commendably concise at 79 minutes, \"The Kill Team\" cuts between Adam\u2019s legal odyssey and recollections of the events in Afghanistan that led to it. The latter sections include interviews with not only Adam but two other kill-team members who essentially corroborate everything he says, though their attitudes toward the events are notably different than his: sure, they knew they were murdering innocent people, they say, but the Afghanis are \"savages\" and war produces pressures that prompt such extreme actions. Plus, many other soldiers were and are doing the same thing; we were just the unlucky ones who got caught.In the end, it\u2019s these attitudes and the men who hold them that are the most disturbing elements of \"The Kill Team.\" On the film\u2019s moral spectrum, Gibbs, the classic psychopath, and Adam, the hapless victim of Kakfaesque circumstance, represent familiar, comprehensible opposites. But Jeremy Morlock and Andrew Holmes, the two kill-team players who were just along for the ride, seem like guys you can imagine on any high-school athletic team or college social committee. Is their amorality about killing fellow human beings for fun a factor in all wars, a particular product of this seemingly endless war with no evident chance of victory, or an inevitable outgrowth of a culture in which traditional morality has been eroded by video-game violence and an ethos of aggressive, unapologetic self-gratification?There is one other character in this mesmerizing film who is no less perplexing than the two just mentioned. That\u2019s Justin Stoner, the private who blew the kill team\u2019s cover when he reported their hashish-use to superiors and was beat up by them for doing so. Cocky and impudent, Stoner may not have been involved in the kill team\u2019s predations but nowhere does he say he has any problem with them, and he vocally despises whistle-blowers like Adam Winfield. Ultimately, he proves to be the arrogant survivor: while all the others are given prison sentences, he gets an honorable discharge, and later returns to the military. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Bad Kids", "Review": "In terms of documentaries and their appeal to different audiences, two basic types might be discerned. One, which could be called the artistic doc, puts an emphasis on stylistic excellence and originality in offering penetrating, revealing views of their subjects, which could be, quite literally, anything. These are films that get rave reviews, draw general audiences to movie theaters, and end up on Oscar shortlists. The second type might be called the niche doc. These appeal primarily to viewers who have a particular interest in their subjects. This type of film finds its natural audiences on television and in various specialized venues, sometimes educational, via different kinds of outreach efforts. Advertisement Keith Fulton and Lou Pepe\u2019s \u201cThe Bad Kids\u201d belongs to the second type, but seems to imagine that it\u2019s the first. Why it might think that is because it\u2019s one of those films that emerges from what might be called the Gates Foundation/Sundance Institute/George Soros/Ford Foundation complex, which often gives us docs that due to their prestigious institutional backing and \u201csocially conscious\u201d themes sometimes make it into certain big festivals (i.e., Sundance) and even movie theaters. Because some people automatically equate a liberal-humanistic outlook and social concerns with artistic worth, a film like \u201cThe Bad Kids\u201d can gain a theatrical release. But it\u2019s not a film for most general theatrical audiences, even those specifically interested in documentaries. It\u2019s for people interested in its main concern: education. The film is mischievously titled. The kids at its center are not at all bad, as we immediately see. Eleventh and twelfth\u00a0graders who attend the Black Rock Continuation High School, an alternative school in a poor corner of California\u2019s Mojave Desert, they are considered \u201cat risk\u201d due to various factors that might keep them from earning high school diplomas: troubled homes, criminal activity, drug habits, or just bad attitudes. The school attempts to overcome these obstacles by letting the students design their own curricula and proceed at their own paces, while also offering them various forms of support, counseling and extracurricular help. The filmmakers spend several months in the school, focusing on a few students and its very committed and skillful female principal. Joey, a scrawny disaffected blond boy, we first see when a truancy officer visits his home and asks what he wants out of life. His inchoate response only hints at troubles that begin with his mom\u2019s drug addiction. He has a habit too, but is also a talented guitar player and songwriter: not a really bad kid by a long shot. As \u201cThe Bad Kids\u201d follows him over the months, Joey comes and goes, vis a vis what\u2019s asked of him at Black Rock. One day we see him give another student a brief description of the difference between Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, adding that his favorite philosopher is Voltaire. No dummy he, obviously. But other times he doesn\u2019t show up at school and has to admit, when he does return, that he\u2019s been using.  Advertisement We witness a similar waxing and waning with Lee, a burly black guy who has a child with another student, a skinny bespectacled girl named Layla. The two seem to want to do the best for their (adorable) little boy, but Lee has difficulties with his elders at home, as do many of these kids. Sometimes he appears quietly motivated; at other times, about to slide off the planet, with no idea why he should be struggling for a diploma. The school\u2019s principal, Vonda Viland, is a truly compelling figure who\u2019s endlessly but very unpretentiously dedicated to her mission. From the time each school day begins, when she\u2019s out front of Black Rock offering smiles and cheery greetings to students, though an arduous day of tete-a-tetes with her sometimes difficult charges, she stays focused and eloquent, occasionally giving kids very personal examples from her own life that they can relate to. The fact that the school is so successful at getting the majority of its students to the goal of graduation obviously owes a lot to her energy and expertise. I said above that the film\u2019s subject is education, but of course there\u2019s another too: poverty. Though it\u2019s nowhere nearly as striking and complex and Marc Levin and Daphne Pinkerson\u2019s \u201cClass Divide,\u201d a brilliant education-themed doc from earlier this year, \u201cThe Bad Kids\u201d also shows the effects economic inequity has on schools and the kids who pass through them. The film is mounted in a serviceable but undistinguished verit\u00e9 manner that eschews talking heads, explanatory titles and other means of conveying information. This of course is the approved style for many docs now, especially those that want to be considered \u201cartistic,\u201d but here it leaves unaddressed various questions its primary audience is bound to wonder about. How was the school\u2019s approach developed? How many schools in the country use it, and with what rates of success? What kind of backing does it get from the state of California and the local school board? What happens to the kids who don\u2019t make it to graduation day? \u201cThe Bad Kids\u201d is interesting enough in what it shows us to spark interest in what it leaves un-shown. In its case, the information supplied by a few well-chosen talking heads could have given it additional clarity and appeal."}
{"Stars": 0.5, "Title": "Revolver", "Review": "Guy Ritchie's \"Revolver\" is a frothing mad film that thrashes against its very sprocket holes in an attempt to bash its brains out against the projector. It seems designed to punish the audience for buying tickets. It is a \"thriller\" without thrills, constructed in a meaningless jumble of flashbacks and flash-forwards and subtitles and mottos and messages and scenes that are deconstructed, reconstructed and self-destructed. I wanted to signal the projectionist to put a gun to it. The plot. What is the plot? Jason Statham has spent seven years in jail, between a con man in the cell on one side and a chess master on the other. Back on the street, he walks into a casino run by his old enemy Ray Liotta and wins a fortune at the table. Did he cheat, or what? I dunno. Liotta sics some hit men on him. Then two mysterious strangers (Vincent Pastore and Andre Benjamin) materialize in Statham's life at just such moments when they are in a position to save it. Who, oh who, could these two men, one of whom plays chess, possibly be? Advertisement The movie (made in 2005 but just now getting a U.S. release) begins with a bunch of sayings which will be repeated endlessly like mantras throughout the film. Chris Cabin at filmcritic.com thinks these have some connection with the Kabbalah beliefs of Ritchie and his wife, Madonna. I know zilch about Kabbalah, but if he's right, and if Ritchie follows them, I would urgently warn other directors to stay clear of Kabbalah. Judging by this film, it encourages you to confuse hopeless confusion with pure reason. Oh, this film angered me. It kept turning back on itself, biting its own tail, doubling back through scenes with less and less meaning and purpose, chanting those sayings as if to hammer us down into accepting them. It employed three editors. Skeleton crew. Some of the acting is better than the film deserves. Make that all of the acting. Actually, the film stock itself is better than the film deserves. You know when sometimes a film catches fire inside a projector? If it happened with this one, I suspect the audience might cheer."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "13th", "Review": "\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,\u00a0except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\" \u2013Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution When the 13th\u00a0amendment was ratified in 1865, its drafters left themselves a large, very exploitable loophole in the guise of an easily missed clause in its definition. That clause, which converts slavery from a legal business model to an equally legal method of punishment for criminals, is the subject of the Netflix documentary \u201c13th.\u201d Premiering\u00a0tonight\u00a0at the New York Film Festival, \u201c13th\u201d is the first documentary to open the festival in its 54 year history. Director Ava DuVernay\u2019s takes an unflinching, well-informed and thoroughly researched look at the American system of incarceration, specifically how the prison industrial complex affects people of color. Her analysis could not be more timely nor more infuriating. The film builds its case piece by shattering piece, inspiring levels of shock and outrage that stun the viewer, leaving one shaken and disturbed before closing out on a visual note of hope designed to keep us on the hook as advocates for change. Advertisement \u201c13th\u201d\u00a0begins with an alarming statistic: One out of four African-American males will serve prison time at one point or another in their lives. Our journey begins from there, with a slew of familiar and occasionally surprising talking heads filling the frame and providing information. DuVernay not only interviews liberal scholars and activists for the cause like Angela Davis, Henry Louis Gates and Van Jones, she also devotes screen time to conservatives such as Newt Gingrich and Grover Norquist. Each interviewee is shot in a location that evokes an industrial setting, which visually supports the theme of prison as a factory churning out the free labor that the 13th Amendment supposedly dismantled when it abolished slavery. We\u2019re told that, after the Civil War, the economy of the former Confederate States of America was decimated. Their primary source of income, slaves, were no longer obligated to line Southerners\u2019 pockets with their blood, sweat and tears. Unless, of course, they were criminals. \u201cExcept as punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted\u201d reads the loophole in the law. In the first iteration of a \u201cSouthern strategy,\u201d hundreds of newly emancipated slaves were re-enlisted into free, legal servitude courtesy of minor or trumped-up charges. The duly convicted part may have been questionable, but by no means did it need to be justifiably proven. So begins a cycle that DuVernay examines in each of its evolving iterations; when one method of subservience-based terror falls out of favor, another takes its place. The list feels endless and includes lynching, Jim Crow, Nixon\u2019s presidential campaign, Reagan\u2019s War on Drugs, Bill Clinton\u2019s Three Strikes and mandatory sentencing laws and the current cash-for-prisoners model that generates millions for private bail and incarceration firms. That last item is a major point of discussion in \u201c13th\u201d, with an onscreen graphic keeping tally of the number of prisoners in the system as the years pass. Starting in the 1940\u2019s, the curve of the prisoner count graph begins rising slowly though steeply. A meteoric rise began during the Civil Rights movement and continued into the current day. As this statistic rises, so does the level of decimation of families of color. The stronger the protest for rights, the harder the system fights back against it with means of incarceration. Profit becomes the major by-product of this cycle, with an organization called ALEC providing a scary, sinister influence on building laws that make its corporate members richer. Advertisement Several times throughout \u201c13th\u201d there is a shock cut to the word CRIMINAL, which stands alone against a black background and is centered on the huge movie screen. It serves as a reminder that far too often, people of color are seen as simply that, regardless of who they are. Starting with D.W. Griffith\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d, DuVernay traces the myth of the scary Black felon with supernatural levels of strength and deviant sexual potency, a myth designed to terrify the majority into believing that only White people were truly human and deserving of proper treatment. This dehumanization allowed for the acceptance of laws and ideas that had more than a hint of bias. We see higher sentences given for crack vs. cocaine possession and plea bargains accepted by innocent people too terrified to go to trial. We also learn that a troubling percentage of people remain in jail because they\u2019re too poor to post their own bail. And regardless of your color, if you\u2019re a felon, you can no longer vote to change the laws that may have unfairly prosecuted you. You lose a primary right all Americans have. \u201c13th\u201d covers a lot of ground as it works its way to the current days of Black Lives Matter and the terrifying videos of the endless list of African-Americans being shot by police or folks who supposedly \u201cstood their ground.\u201d On her journey to this point, DuVernay doesn\u2019t let either political party off the hook, nor does she ignore the fact that many people of color bought into the \u201claw and order\u201d philosophies that led to the current situation. We see Hillary Clinton talking about \u201csuper-predators\u201d and Donald Trump\u2019s full-page ad advocating the death penalty for the Central Park Five (who, as a reminder, were all innocent). We also see people like African-American congressman Charlie Rangel, who originally was on board with the tough on crime laws President Clinton signed into law. By the time we get to the montage of the deaths of Philando Castile, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and others (not to mention the huge, screen-covering graphic of names of African-Americans shot by law enforcement), \u201c13th\u201d has already proven its thesis on how such events can not only occur, but can also seem sadly like \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d It\u2019s a devastating finale to the film, one that follows an onscreen discussion about whether or not the destruction of Black bodies should be run ad nauseum on cable news programs. DuVernay opts to show the footage, with an onscreen disclaimer that it\u2019s being shown with permission by the families of the victims, something she did not need to seek but did so out of respect. Advertisement Between the lines, \u201c13th\u201d\u00a0boldly asks the question if African-Americans were actually ever truly \u201cfree\u201d in this country. We are freer, as this generation has it a lot easier than our ancestors who were enslaved, but the question of being as completely \u201cfree\u201d as our White compatriots hangs in the air. If not, will the day come when all things will be equal? The final takeaway of \u201c13th\u201d is that change must come not from politicians, but from the hearts and minds of the American people. Despite the heavy subject matter, DuVernay ends the film with joyful scenes of children and adults of color enjoying themselves in a variety of activities. It reminds us, as she said in her Q&A with NYFF director Kent Jones, that \u201cBlack trauma is not our entire lives. There is also Black joy.\u201d That inspiring message, and all the important, educational information provided by this excellent documentary, make \u201c13th\u201d a must-see."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Ghost in the Shell", "Review": "\u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d is full of dazzling images that suggest a rich, profound narrative the film is never able to achieve. A young woman brutally rips the hatch off a tank. Her skin and bones crack, revealing mechanical sinew underneath her human exterior. Holographic advertisements the size of skyscrapers glitter across the city\u2019s landscape. Surgeons wear uniforms the color of fresh blood. A robot fashioned in the form of a geisha bends her appendages, crawling up the wall like a frightened spider. These visual delights may provoke momentary awe but they have little impact.  Advertisement Director Rupert Sanders and his collaborators aren\u2019t married to recreating the influential manga or its 1995 anime adaptation wholesale. This isn\u2019t inherently a problem. But how they choose to change this material is. They take the basic skeleton of the story and some its tantalizing imagery, but strip them of their power. \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d takes place in a future in which cybernetic enhancement isn\u2019t just routine but expected. Characters outfit themselves with tech that makes alcohol poisoning a thing of the past, gives them great abilities, and allows them to survive harrowing accidents that would have previously left them dead. The latter is the case for Major Mira (Scarlett Johansson). She was rescued in the wake of an attack on a refugee boat that left her so gravely injured that the government-funded Hanka Industries saves her by placing her mind into a completely artificial body. As characters repeat ad nauseam, she\u2019s the first of her kind. The Major, as she\u2019s routinely referred to, is the perfect blend of the organic and the synthetic, man and machine. She has the mind and soul (or \u201cghost\u201d) of a human woman coupled with the astounding advantages of a machine form. Reborn in this new body, the Major works as an efficient if somewhat reckless agent for Section 9, an ill-defined anti-terrorism division led by Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano). But there\u2019s something amiss beyond the Major\u2019s poor understanding of her own humanity and place in the world. She\u2019s having \u201cglitches,\u201d visual and auditory hallucinations, with increasing regularity, suggesting that her superiors are lying to her. Once the terrorist that Section 9 is hunting down, Kuze (a bored Michael Pitt), warns her not to trust Hanka Industries, the Major searches for the truth behind her existence.  \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d jettisons the complex preoccupations of the source material in order to traffic in a distinctly American story about heroic individualism. There\u2019s also an interest in exploring corporate resistance, which is a bit hypocritical considering the behemoth behind this film, and that the narrative rests these problems on individuals rather than dissecting the systematic forces that make their actions possible. For this approach to the material to work, the characters and the world they inhabit need to feel distinct. Unfortunately, one of the most damning faults of this adaptation is that its world building, while having the appearance of intricacy, proves to be as hollow as the rest of the film upon closer examination. The visual landscape of \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d suggests a host of fascinating questions. What does the chance of being hacked suggest about the quicksilver nature of identity in this world? If you don\u2019t have cybernetic upgrades what does that mean for your life personally and professionally? The team members of Section 9 seem to be diverse\u2014has technology affected the way people relate to their own race and gender? Unfortunately, these questions are only momentarily considered or blithely ignored in order to reiterate just how special the Major is, in case you forgot from the twenty other times characters mention it.  Advertisement This lack of detailing extends to the characters themselves. The Major spends a considerable amount of time with her Section 9 teammates but I honestly couldn\u2019t name one single personality trait for any of them beyond being dedicated to their work. The only one who gets enough focus to rise above being completely forgettable is Batou (Pilou Asb\u00e6k). He has a comfortable rapport with the Major that causes her to crack a smile and some occasional jokes, suggesting she has more humanity than she gives herself credit for. As Dr. Ouelet, the Major\u2019s chief creator, Juliette Binoche imbues a warmth and nearly neurotic sense of overprotection that suggests an interesting mother/daughter dynamic. This isn\u2019t enough. The lightning pace of the film means that just when a scene is about to touch a nerve it moves on to the next. The score buzzes and swells with intrigue that the action on-screen doesn\u2019t communicate. Typically, a strong lead performance can make even the most cumbersome film have charm and merit, but Johansson struggles to create a meaningful emotional through line for the Major. In recent years, Johansson has proven to be a mesmerizing actress who brings an intelligence and fearsome quality to her work. \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d is a continuation of the roles she\u2019s excelled at playing in \u201cUnder the Skin,\u201d \u201cHer,\u201d and various turns as super-spy Black Widow in Marvel\u2019s Cinematic Universe. It marries her impressive physicality as an action star, emotional vulnerability, and steely determinism. Yet, even she isn\u2019t skilled enough to imbue the Major with the depth necessary for her arc to feel moving and profound. She also can\u2019t sell me on the ridiculous philosophy the film peddles about how memories are inconsequential to human identity; apparently, only our actions matter. All these issues\u2014poorly thought out moral quandaries, surface level world building, scant character development\u2014come to a head in the film\u2019s queasy racial politics. A dark cloud has hung over \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d since Johansson\u2019s casting was announced. The debate over whether her character, who in the source material had the name Motoko Kusanagi, should reflect the racial origins of the manga and subsequent anime films was intelligently explored in an essay for The Verge by Emily Yoshida. No matter where you come down in the debate over this, it becomes hard to ignore when you notice how the most important characters are white or that every time Aramaki speaks Japanese the Major only replies in English. \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d makes the troubling decision to use Japanese culture, visual flourishes, and source material but decides that a Japanese actress as the lead would be a step too far. At times, \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d is beautiful, even stunning. But these visual pleasures can\u2019t mask the narrative emptiness. Never has there been a film so obsessed with the human soul that proves soulless itself.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Endless Love", "Review": "\"Endless Love\" isn't so much a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film as it is an extended ad for the idyllic Abercrombie & Fitch lifestyle. This is supposed to be a film about the throes of teenage first love\u2014a love you would go to jail for, set a house on fire for, a love that requires a restraining order\u2014but it's awfully tasteful and emotionally detached in its blissed-out depiction of beautiful young people cavorting in the sunlight.  Toned, tanned David and Jade (Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde, both former models) frolic in a meadow, leap off a dock in slow motion and splash in a lake, all to the blare of alt rock music to signal to us how we should react to these images. They make romantic love on the carpet by the fireplace light (but this time there's no creepy mom watching them from the shadows). Even their vaguely grungy moments\u2014kissing in the back of a beat-up pickup truck or in the hot summer rain\u2014feel impeccably art designed.  Advertisement In short, director and co-writer Shana Feste has remade \"Endless Love\" but she's taken out all the crazy. Not that the original was all that great to begin with; a six-time Razzie Award nominee, it was screechy, melodramatic and over-acted, with an awkwardly flat lead performance from Brooke Shields. But at least it had passion. Pettyfer and Wilde look lovely together\u2014although they're both in their mid-20s playing 17-year-olds, and it shows\u2014and they do enjoy some real chemistry throughout their flirtatious, falling-in-love stage. But the sense that something vital is at stake is woefully lacking. Some of the basic details and visual touchstones are in place, but Feste (\"Country Strong\") and co-writer Joshua Safran have reconfigured this story entirely\u2014and, notably, omitted the Oscar-nominated Lionel Richie-Diana Ross theme song which was such a ubiquitous hit on radios and prom dance floors alike. (Also missing this time around: the small role of the wild-eyed arsonist played by a young Tom Cruise in mercilessly short Daisy Dukes.) Now, instead of an age difference, there's a class difference. David is a smart, decent, blue-collar guy who's happy to go into business with his father (Robert Patrick) as a mechanic rather than apply to college. Jade is a wealthy, sheltered and studious girl with plans to attend Brown University in the fall and become a cardiologist like her father (Bruce Greenwood). The night of their high school graduation, David and Jade meet cute at the swanky restaurant where David works as a valet alongside his wisecracking best friend (a likable Dayo Okeniyi). Sparks fly instantly and the two become inseparable for the rest of the summer, to the vocal disapproval of Jade's snobbish dad. His overprotectiveness also stems from his continued grief over the loss of Jade's superstar older brother a few years back.  But the rest of the family welcomes David in; Jade's mother (Joely Richardson) and older brother (Rhys Wakefield) both experience much-needed emotional awakenings at the sight of Jade reveling in her first love. As David insinuates himself further with these folks\u2014in a sweet and hunky way, rather than a dark and stalky way\u2014something clearly has to give.  Advertisement Just as the tension between father and suitor should be increasing, though, Feste goes through the motions en route to her happy ending. Strong, veteran character actors like Greenwood, Patrick and Richardson certainly elevate this predictable, lightweight material, but they can only do so much.  Watching \"Endless Love,\" you long for it to be riskier, edgier, or at least more reflective of actual teenage experiences and emotions. Even the partying feels false, with freshly scrubbed kids talking about getting drunk and high without actually taking part in such activities or indicating their eventual effects. (Ostensibly, this creative decision was intended to secure a PG-13 rating.) Feste's sanitized version seems like it's aimed not at high-school kids but rather at those who are even younger: girls who can leave the theater and peruse the mall for just the right boho-chic clothes to emulate Wilde's fashionably wild look."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Mountains May Depart", "Review": "Back in the \u201870s, Rainer Werner Fassbinder described a number of his films as comprising the basis of a projected \u201cmoral history of modern Germany\u201d (unfortunately he didn\u2019t live to complete it). A number of works by Taiwan\u2019s Hou Hsiao-hsien seem to be dedicated to a similar project. In mainland China, the one major filmmaker with kindred ambitions is Jia Zhang-ke. While stalwarts of Chinese cinema\u2019s \u201cFifth Generation\u201d such as Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige (as well as Hou in Taiwan) have deviated into making internationally crowd-pleasing, martial arts spectaculars, Jia has kept his eyes closely fixed on Chinese society as it has evolved through a tumultuous period of history. Advertisement \n The most lauded of China\u2019s Sixth Generation filmmakers, Jia has always evinced a confidence and a seriousness of purpose that are on fine display in \u201cMountains May Depart,\u201d another intimate journey through history that\u2019s as stirring and beautifully nuanced as anything he\u2019s made. Though perhaps the greatest of recent Chinese films, it does, however, have a significant drawback that must be acknowledged at the outset. \n The film\u2019s story moves its characters through three different time periods, from 1999 to 2014 and then 2025. The first two transpire in China and center on a character played by Jia\u2019s muse (and wife) Zhao Tao, whose performance is truly brilliant and the film\u2019s emotional linchpin. The third part, which takes place mainly in Australia, finds Zhao\u2019s character not entirely absent but sidelined to the point that the movie inevitably suffers. \n As its time frame might suggest, the thematic center of the new film is the destabilizing impact of market-driven prosperity on China from the \u201890s till now. Set, as many earlier Jia films are, in the director\u2019s hometown of Fenyang, in northern China, the story\u2019s first part (which is also the longest) starts with the nation celebrating the approach of the year 2000. It\u2019s a happy, celebratory time, due not just to the chronological landmark but also the newfound wealth and relative freedoms that have transformed China. When we first see vivacious Shen Tao (Zhao), she\u2019s in millennial party mode, leading a young dance troupe in an infectious routine set to the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 version of \u201cGo West\u201d (Jia\u2019s witty use of international pop music remains a trademark). But the abundance that much of China is enjoying has a problematic romantic corollary for Tao, who\u2019s being pursued by two men. The roughly handsome, taciturn Liangzi (Liang Jin Dong), a mine worker, never really confesses his feelings but they are obvious enough. His rival, Zhang Jiansheng (Zhang Yi), on the other hand, is a glad-handing nouveau-capitalist who\u2019s constantly offering gifts and other demonstrations of his affection. Advertisement \n This rich-man/poor-man sentimental dichotomy may sound all too schematic in its symbolism, but it works due to the humanistic detail Jia gives it and the sharp work of the main actors. Although Tao does fall for Zhang\u2014who buys the mine where Liangzi works and fires him\u2014we never feel that it\u2019s solely due to the material comforts he offers her, even in a China that still remembers the astringencies of the Cultural Revolution. The young woman\u2019s heart is mercurial and Zhang also promises the gift that arrives soon after their glitzy wedding: a son, whom the beaming father confidently names Dollar. \n When the second episode arrives, much has changed. Tao is rich but long separated from Zhang, who lives with another woman and Dollar in Shanghai but has his ever-entrepreneurial eyes now set on Australia. In this section, Tao retains some of her buoyancy but her youthful optimism is tested and tempered by challenges on several fronts: her beloved father\u2019s decline due to age; Liangzi\u2019s return to Fenyang suffering from a lung ailment due to his work in the mines; and the estrangement she finds in Dollar when he comes for a visit. \n In the story\u2019s final part, we\u2019re in Australia, where Zhang is wealthy but indolent, bitter and alienated from Dollar (now Dong Zijan), who doesn\u2019t know what he wants, besides not wanting his dad\u2019s life, and who falls into a desultory affair with an older female teacher (the redoubtable Sylvia Chang). On paper, this turn in the story no doubt makes good sense. The subject of Chinese people who\u2019ve been propelled overseas by prosperity is a great one, and right in line with the chronicles Jia has provided till now. Unfortunately, this section of the film proves to be its weakest part, in part because Jia doesn\u2019t seem entirely comfortable working in English, but more because the film lacks the powerful emotional focus provided by Tao and the actress playing her. Advertisement \n Always a playful stylist, Jia and cinematographer Yu Lik-wai give each section a different aspect ratio and incorporate other visual indicators of the different eras represented. There are also spurts of the surrealistic touches the director sometimes embeds in a realistic style that appreciates the particularities of landscapes and cities as well as the occasional disruptions and absurdities provided by post-Communist modernity. Whatever Jia shows us and wherever he takes us, we\u2019re always aware of being in the hands of one of the contemporary world\u2019s great filmmakers."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Fifty Shades of Black", "Review": "Between all the gags involving prosthetic penises (of the freakishly large and small varieties), between all the tasteless racial jokes, random pop-culture references and wacky-kinky sexual hijinks, \u201cFifty Shades of Black\u201d actually may have something of substance on its meandering mind. Seriously. Just hear me out on this. Yes, it\u2019s a Wayans genre spoof (which wasn\u2019t shown to critics before opening, it should not surprise you in the least to discover), along the lines of the \u201cScary Movie\u201d and \u201cA Haunted House\u201d franchises. Yes, it is as raunchy, juvenile, scattered and downright disgusting as those movies tend to be. And yes, it\u2019s making fun of the \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d phenomenon, a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit if ever there was one. But there\u2019s a moment toward the end that suggests maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 Marlon Wayans & Co. were trying to make a pointed cultural statement. Advertisement Really. Just go with me here. Wayans, as star/co-writer/co-producer, plays Christian Black, a send-up of Christian Grey, the hunky, tormented billionaire sadist of E.L. James\u2019 awful but addictive \u201cFifty Shades\u201d novels. In the climactic scene where Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk in a takeoff on the virginal but curious Anastasia Steele) asks Christian to give it to her as hard as he can, he ponders her punishment by surveying the array of whips hanging on the wall of his Red Room of Pain. They\u2019re labeled \u201cAmistad,\u201d \u201cGlory,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d That\u2019s clever in itself. But then Hannah takes the notion further by turning the tables on Christian and doling out her own lashings \u2013 as retribution, she says, for the sufferings of Kerry Washington\u2019s character in \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s character in \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d (She also gets in a dig about how gratuitous it was that her \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d counterpart, Dakota Johnson, was naked for so much of the movie. While cutesy and meta, it\u2019s also an excellent point.) Although the majority of \u201cFifty Shades of Black\u201d is giggly and gross, this one scene suggests that Wayans, co-writer Rick Alvarez and director Michael Tiddes are actually trying to say something about the fetishization of slavery in film under the guise of art and awards-season prestige. They\u2019re equating the sickening violence of those movies with the titillation of what is essentially glossy, soft-core porn. And putting a strong, intelligent black woman in control completely changes the power dynamic in fascinating ways. The moment ends quickly enough, and then it\u2019s back to Hannah getting her head slammed between the elevator doors in Christian\u2019s luxurious penthouse. But it\u2019s enough to make you think, albeit briefly. Mostly, \u201cFifty Shades of Black\u201d is exactly what you expect it will be. It hits all the notes of its source material, only it amps them up, and it seems to get the inherent absurdity of this premise even more than Sam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s movie did. Fans of the series surely will enjoy revisiting key moments: the meet-cute when Hannah literally falls into Christian\u2019s office on her hands and knees; the awkward interview for her college newspaper; Christian stalking Hannah at the hardware store where she works; the awkward photo shoot; the even more awkward coffee date; the first visit to the Red Room of Pain; the negotiation of a sexual contract. And they\u2019re all connected by multiple aerial shots of the glittering Seattle skyline. That\u2019s about it as far as cohesion goes. Advertisement Extended non-sequiturs and detours abound. Some work, like the bits that parody \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cWhiplash.\u201d Most don\u2019t, like anything involving Hannah\u2019s promiscuous roommate, Kateesha (Jenny Zigrino), a white woman wallowing in crass black stereotypes. (Then again, there\u2019s probably a point being made there, too, about race relations. It just isn\u2019t terribly sharp, and it\u2019s easier to go for the broad gag.) Tossed-aside jokes about Bill Cosby, the films of Cuba Gooding Jr. and The Weeknd (whose original song \u201cEarned It\u201d from \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d received an Academy Award nomination) are hit-and-miss. A slapsticky scene involving a Taser and the Black Lives Matter movement falls flat; it\u2019s simplistic rather than provocative. But I will say this for \u201cFifty Shades of Black\u201d: It made me laugh more often than I did in \u201cDirty Grandpa.\u201d That is to say, I laughed more than once. And you really can\u2019t ask for more than that in January."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Almost Holy", "Review": "\u201cI want to clean my soul now, after this story,\u201d says Pastor Gennadiy Mokhnenko, the subject of \"Almost Holy.\" The remark comes after we learn about a deaf Ukrainian teenager whose adult housemate spent years sexually assaulting her, at one point impregnating her and taking the baby to a destination unknown. The teenager has arrived at Pilgrim Republic rehabilitation center, an organization run by Pastor Gennadiy to help children get off the street and off drugs. In sign language, the distraught young woman repeatedly asks if the pastor can find and return her daughter. He promises to try. He also confronts the housemate, using language that, while appropriate, is surprising to hear from a preacher. Advertisement Pastor Gennadiy, or Crocodile Gennadiy as he calls himself, is more than a man of God. He is a prominent figure in the Ukraine, where his tough love activism is equally controversial and revered. His means of assisting young street children hooked on heroin occasionally borders on abduction. \u201cAlmost Holy\u201d introduces us to several of these children, including the eight kids Mokhnenko added to his existing family of three. Additionally, we meet Pilgrim workers who were saved by its founder and are now paying it forward by assisting and advising. \u201cAlmost Holy\u201d shows Crocodile Gennadiy at work, taking us into the sewers and the mean streets of Mariupol, Ukraine. Some of the imagery is horrific, but at no time is it exploitative or used as poverty porn as in the similarly themed \u201cTrash\u201d and \u201cSlumdog Millionaire.\" Aided by an unobtrusive score by Atticus Ross (\u201cThe Social Network\u201d), director Steve Hoover maintains a strict, naturalistic hold on the material that never telegraphs how we are supposed to feel, nor does it make its subjects into unrecognizable others. It helps that \u201cAlmost Holy\u201d presents this material as a series of stories Crocodile Gennadiy is telling during a speaking engagement at a women\u2019s penitentiary. We become flies on the wall, destined to listen and learn rather than pity and feel superior. Mokhnenko explains that his \u201cCrocodile\u201d moniker comes not from Paul Hogan, but from a famous Soviet cartoon with a crocodile character that shares both his name and his penchant for helping people. The crocodile\u2019s sidekick is a dog with a coif straight out of a Bronner Brothers hair show. Mokhnenko\u2019s cartoon alter ego shows up occasionally in animated interludes, antagonized by a mean old lady who has definitely read Ayn Rand. These moments are cleverly used, welcome respites from a harsh, cold reality; if only things were as easy for the real Crocodile Gennadiy as they are for his cartoon counterpart. Advertisement \u201cAlmost Holy\u201d is broken down into three time frames, starting with 2000-2008 and working up to the present day. It charts the changing political and social state of Ukraine up to Putin, Crimea and the current state of unrest the country is facing. As the protests get closer to Mariupol, the film juxtaposes this battle to save Ukraine with Crocodile Gennadiy\u2019s ongoing crusade to save its children. Though \u201cAlmost Holy\u201d holds its humble hero in a higher esteem than some viewers may (a shot of his silhouette looming against a fireworks-filled sky plays almost like a Marvel comic panel), it also treats everyone else with more dignity than you may expect. This includes the children who are trying to detox, as well as the mysterious woman who sells them the opiate drugs that addict them. She has an aura of mystery that the film maintains; she becomes a symbolic representation of the problem. Terrence Malick is one of the producers of \"Almost Holy,\" and while Hoover doesn\u2019t go for a full interpretation/realization of his style, there are touches that evoke the director\u2019s work, especially in the film\u2019s last sequence. (The lingering final shot is pure Malick.) Like with Malick's \"The Tree of Life,\" water plays a significant visual role in the film, and there are meditative views of religious imagery that hang around onscreen while Mokhnenko narrates on the soundtrack. \u201cAlmost Holy\u201d provides no easy answers, nor does it coddle us with the promise of a happy ending for those Crocodile Gennadiy helps. Even he says, with some stoicism, that circumstances beyond his control often hinder his success rate. People are going to do whatever they think is best for themselves, even if it isn\u2019t. But that\u2019s no excuse not to try to help anyway. To the filmmakers, Pastor Gennadiy Mokhnenko is a bit of a superhero. I found myself leaning that way too."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "All the Light in the Sky", "Review": "Jane Adams has a sweet baffled sadness that brings an empathetic response from an audience. You feel protective of her. You want her to do well, be happy. She had only two or three scenes in \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" and that character vibrated with an entire life and back story that went on off-screen as well as on. She has been giving excellent performances for over 20 years now, both in independent film and repertory theater across the United States. Her latest, \"All the Light in the Sky\", is another collaboration with \"mumblecore\" director Joe Swanberg, this time in a script she co-wrote with him. There are so many powerful themes suggested in the script, having to do with aging (particularly for women), and losing your sexual power, and Adams, yet again, commands the screen with authenticity and simplicity, but the film lacks commitment. It comes across as a pebble skipping off the surface of much deeper waters. The themes are treated casually, almost offhandedly, and while that is not necessarily a bad thing, \"All the Light in the Sky\" remains extremely slight in feeling and tone, afraid of its own implications.  Advertisement  Adams plays Marie, a middle-aged actress renting an apartment that hangs over the Pacific Ocean, the waves rolling under her porch. She is still up for parts in films, but those roles are going to Kristen Wiig now, and Marie, talking with her agent on speaker-phone, is a good sport about it, and says that sure, she will sign on for a new indie that has no budget but \"at least it has a start date\", which means it's real. She is not married. She has no children. She has no boyfriend. She falls asleep listening to inspirational audio books about philosophy and religion, and wakes up every morning to don a wetsuit and go paddle boarding in the ocean. She meets up occasionally with an expert in solar energy, interviewing him as research for what we assume is another role. He talks about different gadgets that can harness the power of the sun, an obvious metaphor which drags the film down, the rest of it being so feather-light it can't take such gravitas.   Marie's niece, Faye (Sophia Takal), is an aspiring actress and comes to stay with her aunt for a while. Marie thrills to the role of Aunt, passing on her wisdom to Faye based on her years of experience in the industry. There are revealing moments here, obviously close to Jane Adams' heart, about being a 20-something actress and watching all of your friends start to become successful, leaving you behind. Adams relates these truths as she makes complicated healthy juices in her blender, often sidestepping the sheer pathos of her tale through laughter and a good attitude, but the sadness that flickers on the edges of her worried eyes is eloquent.   Faye is an undeveloped character, albeit beautifully played by Takal. Aunt and niece are not peers, but they are both adults now, and there is a comfort in family that is clear in the energy between them. The introduction of a young woman into Marie's world, a young woman just starting out on the path of the same career, seems like it would be ripe with opportunities for conflict. No conflict comes, leaving their interactions to sit there on the screen, flat and shallow. The most fascinating moment in the film is when Marie confesses to her niece that she misses looking forward to taking off her clothes when she is with a man for the first time, that now that she is older she gets nervous and insecure. Marie says that when she was younger she felt that she, the woman, had the pressure to be \"the engine that got the whole thing started\", the object, and now that she doesn't have that anymore, she feels lost. It's an electric confession, honest and scary, suggesting a gigantic world of loss, the unnameable sadness of losing your sexual power.  Advertisement  But the whole film is so casual about all of it, and Swanberg, who seems more interested in finding the beauty in some of the images he frames (more so than he has in his other films), doesn't do much with the frame once he sets it up. Actors sit and talk within the frame, often in one long take, and the \"event\" of the scene, whatever it may be, starts to loosen, lose focus, fall apart. Many of these scenes feel like really productive rehearsals, improvisation exercises for the actors to find out their motivation and objective. But everyone sitting around talking doesn't lead us anywhere. The film starts to feel opaque, hidden under a veil of its own casual attitude. And the final image, which is a stunner, doesn't open us up to deeper understanding. It just sits there, static, beautiful and not much else."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The House of the Devil", "Review": "Has there ever been a movie where a teenage baby-sitter enjoyed a pleasant evening? And a non-demonic child? Sam gets a break in \"The House of the Devil.\" She discovers there isn't a baby at all. Only the aged mother of Mr. Ulman, a sinister man played by Tom Noonan, who is my choice to portray The Judge in Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, and if you have read that gruesome masterpiece, there is nothing more I need say about Mr. Ulman. Sam (Jocelin Donahue) is a perky college student saving money for a deposit on her own apartment. She puts up signs around the campus asking for her baby-sitting services, and after she takes one of them, Mr. Ulman takes all of the rest... Advertisement Sam's friend Megan (Greta Gerwig) gives her a lift to the Ulman household, which they find way, way down at the end of a long, long road in the middle of a dark, dark forest. It looks like the House of the Seven Gables with three gables amputated. Mr. Ulman and his wife, Mrs. Ulman (Mary Woronov), greet Sam with hospitality laced with commiseration. The house is furnished in a way to remind you of aged maiden aunts who haven't changed a thing since their parents died. Mother Ulman is upstairs in her room, Mr. Ulman explains. He only told Sam there was a baby because some baby-sitters balk at the difficulties of old folks. But not to worry. Mr. Ulman more or less promises she'll be no more problem than Norman Bates' mom. Then the Ulmans depart because they want to observe the full eclipse of the moon, and you can't even see the moon so deep in the dark, dark forest, you see. \tLeft alone on her own (Mother upstairs in her room and doesn't make a sound), Sam pokes around. It's sort of... creepy. Good thing she only snaps on the TV briefly; If the Addams Family came on, it might look familiar. And it might come on: This is the mid-1980s, when babysitters had more to fear from their employers than vice versa. \"The House of the Devil\" has been made almost by hand by Ti West, who wrote, directed and edited the movie. He's an admirer of classic horror films and understands that if there's anything scarier than haunted house, it's a possibly haunted house. The film may provide an introduction for some audience members to the Hitchcockian definition of suspense: It's the anticipation, not the happening, that's the fun. This is the kind of movie that looks lighted by the full of the moon, which is a good trick during an eclipse. Sam is relieved when Mr. and Mrs. Ulman return, until they don't seem prepared to give her the traditional ride home. She also meets Mother (Danielle Noe), who is considerably more spry than advertised. And there's the family -- handyman? -- named Victor (AJ Bowen). And Mother's room turns out to be far, far different than you might expect -- and dark, dark."}

Mike Cahill, the\r\nwriter/director of \u201cAnother Earth\u201d and \u201cI Origins,\u201d is fascinated with where\r\nthese seemingly diametrically opposed viewpoints conflict or, more\r\ninterestingly, intersect. Can we be scientific and faithful? Can we believe in\r\nforces beyond our control even as we live in a world increasingly fascinated\r\nwith explaining how everything works? With \u201cI Origins,\u201d Cahill takes this\r\ninternal conflict common in so many people and pegs something of a Puzzle Movie\r\non to it as one science-minded man experiences that which he cannot explain\r\nwith traditional reason. It is a film that can sometimes frustrate in its supporting characters\u00a0but Cahill\r\nand his talented cast are unapologetically willing to explore the kind of\r\ncomplex intangibles that filmmakers often ignore or merely turn into\r\npretentious drivel.  Advertisement Dr. Ian Grey (Michael Pitt) is obsessed with the human eye,\r\none of the elements of biology that makes us unique and that religions around\r\nthe world have used as proof of the Divine Creator. We all have eye biometrics\r\nthat are specific to us, and various cultures have viewed the eye as a window\r\nto the soul or even the thumbprint of a creator. Grey wants to get to the\r\nbottom of the evolution of the eye, working with colleagues Kenny (Steven Yeun)\r\nand Karen (Brit Marling). Then he meets a model whose eyes essentially take him\r\nemotional prisoner. At a party, Ian has a sexy encounter with a mostly masked\r\nwoman named Sofi (Astrid Berg\u00e8s-Frisbey) and can\u2019t stop thinking about her. He\r\nfinds himself pushed by fate or destiny to a billboard of her unforgettable\r\neyes, eventually tracking Sofi down and beginning a passionate romance with the\r\nwoman who will change his life. While the preview for \u201cI Origins\u201d gives away\r\nalmost the entire film, we\u2019ll stop the plot synopsis here\u2014it\u2019s better if you\r\ndon\u2019t know much\u2014but Ian\u2019s relationship with Sofi sends him down a very\r\ndifferent path than the scientific one on which he began. \u201cI Origins\u201d is a film\r\nabout how destiny and love can lead us to different revelations than we could\r\nhave possibly reached without them. Anyone who has known love can attest to its\r\nability to forever alter a charted course and Cahill\u2019s emotionally raw approach\r\nto filmmaking gets to the truth of that in a memorable way. It\u2019s also a remarkably confident film technically. Cinema\r\nhas had a love affair with the eye for a century now and Cahill and\r\ncinematographer Markus F\u00f6rderer take the timeless image of the eye and give it\r\nemotional resonance in the way they use it, balancing the film's two equally important halves. Cahill and his technical team\r\nwisely ground their film, only occasionally allowing it flights of visual\r\nfancy. We spend more time with Ian and Karen in a lab than we do in existential\r\npursuit of a greater purpose. And that makes the film\u2019s more extremely philosophical\r\nthemes forgivable. Cahill's work here is a notable technical advancement over \"Another Earth,\" proving he's not just a filmmaker with big ideas but one who can pull them off with visual confidence as well. There's a flow in the cinematography and editing that carries us along, only occasionally becoming untethered to a pretentious degree. Cahill\u2019s smartest move was to not allow his film\u2019s \u201cbig\r\nissues\u201d to overwhelm the human story at its core. And he\u2019s helped notably by\r\nyet-another strong performance from Michael Pitt, an actor who has shown such\r\nrange just recently from his terrifying work on TV's \u201cHannibal\u201d to this relatable,\r\nlikable performance. Advertisement The film's biggest problem is that the two women in Ian\u2019s life aren\u2019t as well-drawn as they\r\ncould have been in a superior film. Sofi and Karen feel a bit too much like\r\nobvious opposites\u2014the \"spiritual model\" and the \"scientific technician.\" If both\r\ncharacters were allowed a bit more of their alternate, \u201cI Origins\u201d would have\r\nbeen a more interesting venture. For, in the end, it\u2019s a film that argues we\r\ndon\u2019t live in a world of science OR faith but one in which both will give us a\r\ndeeper understanding of who we are and where we\u2019re going."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "West of the Jordan River", "Review": "In 1982, Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai traveled to the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip before and during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Gitai and a small crew shot a travel diary that examined a civilian view of war, contrasting Palestinian and Israeli experiences in the area. The resulting film \u201cField Diary\u201d took a critical view of the invasion and the Israeli government\u2019s treatment of Palestinian refugees. When \u201cField Diary\u201d premiered in Jerusalem, it immediately created controversy and provoked hostile reactions from the populace and the military alike. Gitai left the country and emigrated to France where he lived until he returned to Israel in 1993, after Yitzak Rabin was elected prime minister and the first Oslo Accords were signed in Washington D.C. Advertisement Now, 35 years later, with the occupation issue at a frustrating standstill, and a conservative, reactionary government in power, Gitai returns to the occupied territories for his follow-up film diary \u201cWest of the Jordan River.\u201d Gitai explores the wizened discontent of Israeli and Palestinian civilians, and how some have tried to help mend the conflicts that the government has catalyzed. He interviews activists, journalists, current and former government officials, as well as unaffiliated citizens to craft a portrait of a region in static disarray. For the most part, Gitai provides a platform for marginalized voices to speak freely, an approach that works best when he profiles organizations like The Parents\u2019 Circle, which gathers Palestinian and Israeli parents who have lost children in the conflict to share their grief, or B\u2019Tselem, a human rights group that aids Palestinian women to capture injustice on video. But \u201cWest of the Jordan River\u201d works best when Gitai involves himself in the interviews. Gitai is a compelling screen presence\u2014empathetic and patient, but also skeptical and necessarily forceful. He shines when he pushes back against his subjects, such as when he expresses disbelief at a journalist\u2019s claim that human rights NGOs, like Breaking the Silence, are working in tandem with an international campaign to destroy Israel as a Jewish country. At one point, he tries to explain to a group of Palestinian refugees that anti-peace coalitions on both sides are much stronger than groups that seek reconciliation, but his words fall on indifferent ears. Gitai\u2019s methodology is certainly valid, and there\u2019s value in a tribute to the courage of individuals trying to rectify problems created by a centuries-old conflict and exacerbated by ideologues. But beyond its social or political aims, \u201cWest of the Jordan River\u201d fails to compel as a film. Aesthetically speaking, it\u2019s at best functional, and at worst completely disinterested. It lumbers from interview to interview without much semblance of structure (beyond Gitai\u2019s bookended interviews with Rabin from 1994), and Gitai\u2019s subjects often parrot similar talking points, frequently rendering individual voices muddled. Gitai tries to communicate valuable information, but his method of delivery is severely lacking. I have not seen \u201cField Diary,\u201d so it\u2019s entirely possible I\u2019m missing certain parallels or callbacks that would lend \u201cWest of the Jordan River\u201d some extra weight. But it\u2019s difficult to ignore the sections of this film that feel merely slapped together. Advertisement With \u201cWest of the Jordan River,\u201d Gitai seeks to create a series of \u201chuman encounters,\u201d and there are times when this intention shines through. The best scene in the film features Gitai conversing with a child who lives in Hebron. When asked about his dreams, the child cheerfully replies that he wishes to die a martyr. Gitai tries to communicate to him that life is worth living, but the kid, frustrated and befuddled by the line of questioning, casually says that he knows life is good, but dying for a cause is simply better. This is a complex, layered interaction that has its own identity, and communicates volumes about the state of the human condition in the occupied territories. It\u2019s a shame that the rest of \u201cWest of the Jordan River\u201d cannot live up to this brief vignette that seems to encapsulate exactly what Gitai tries to accomplish. Instead, we\u2019re left with a film that has a lot to say but lacking the appropriate way to say it."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Mountain Between Us", "Review": "She once survived a sinking ship in \"Titanic.\" He once thrived on the mean streets of Baltimore on \u201cThe Wire.\u201d Kate Winslet and Idris Elba should by all rights have enough dramatic weight between them to easily elevate a two-hander about strangers who must rescue themselves from a desolate snow-blanketed Utah mountain range after their charter plane crashes. Instead, \u201cThe Mountain Between Us\u201d is a high-altitude soap opera, woozy with overly telegraphed peril and determined to make the audience root for a couple who clearly aren\u2019t meant for each other and played by actors who deserve a generous C-minus in chemistry. In the film\u2019s production notes, Elba\u2014considered dreamboat material by his many fans\u2014notes that this is his first-ever romantic lead. His surprising awkwardness during the film\u2019s intimate moments perhaps explains why. Advertisement What really comes between Winslet\u2019s globetrotting photojournalist Alex and Elba\u2019s brain surgeon Ben as fate and bad weather bring them together isn\u2019t so much geographical but script-related. Based on a novel by Charles Martin, the screenplay is a collaboration between Chris Weitz (\u201cAbout a Boy,\u201d the live-action \u201cCinderella\u201d) and J. Mills Goodloe (\u201cThe Age of Adaline,\u201d \u201cEverything, Everything\u201d). I\u2019ll vouch for Weitz\u2019s skills, but in the case of Goodloe, anyone who has adapted a Nicholas Sparks\u2019 novel that isn\u2019t \u201cThe Notebook\u201d is suspect. And having seen \u201cThe Best of Me,\u201d I rest my case.\u00a0  Palestinian director Hany Abu-Assad, the maker of two politically charged Oscar-nominated foreign films (\u201cParadise Now\u201d and \u201cOmar,\u201d the last featuring a love story) certainly has cred. But he fails to achieve producer Peter Chernin\u2019s self-proclaimed vision of a romantic epic in the tradition of \u201cDr. Zhivago\u201d and \u201cOut of Africa.\u201d Compared to those classics, \u201cMountain\u201d is more of a molehill.  Right out of the gate, I had an uneasy feeling about \u201cThe\u00a0Mountain Between Us\u201d as all flights are canceled at an Idaho airport because of an incoming blizzard. Alex, desperate to head back to New York in time for her wedding, overhears Ben complaining that he has to operate on a young boy the next morning. She proposes they share a small plane for hire. Their pilot is Beau Bridges, who emits good ol\u2019 boy vibes as he brings his soulful-eyed golden Labrador on-board. That his Walter doesn\u2019t bother to file a flight plan is an all-too-convenient warning sign.  Not long after takeoff, while flying over remote treacherous terrain packed with white stuff, Walter begins to slur his speech and Ben recognizes he is having a stroke. Thank goodness, I have never witnessed anyone having such an attack. But Bridges, perhaps making up for the brevity of his part, seems to have taken his cues from Ian Holm\u2019s Ash, the malfunctioning android in \u201cAlien.\u201d The crash itself isn\u2019t all that terrifying in these days of \u201cFlight\u201d and \u201cSully.\u201d But Walter is a goner, the dog survives and he is in better shape than Alex, who has a huge gash on her leg. Ben\u2014oh, thank goodness, there just happens to be a doctor in the house\u2014fixes her up as best he can before tending to his own cuts and bruises.  Advertisement The medical stuff is the easy part. Cooperating with someone you just met is a bit tougher. Once Alex wakes, she reveals herself to be someone prone to taking risks and usually trusts her instincts in tight situations. With no cell phone reception and with all devices that could have alerted the occasional jet overhead unfortunately out of commission, she thinks they should abandon ship and take their chances on foot. The more conservative Ben, meanwhile, is less inclined to leave what\u2019s left of the aircraft and would rather stay put. As she heals, the pair has a get-to-know-you period. Oddly, Ben wears a wedding ring but does not mention his wife. Alex, meanwhile, knows that if she had made it to her nuptials, she would have \u201crushed down the aisle like Dustin Hoffman in \u2018The Graduate.\u2019\u201d Ben waits a beat and echoes the thoughts of many a cinephile in the theater by observing that Hoffman was trying to stop the wedding. For emphasis, he meekly utters, \u201cElaine!\u201d  That is meet-cute stuff right there but the early portion of \u201cThe Mountain Between Us\u201d suggests a variation on \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u2026\u201d Namely, can a man and a woman become companions and work together for a common cause? (That cause here being\u00a0survival.) I liked that there seemed to be no lovey-dovey business at this point. But then Alex looks through her camera lens and sees a metallic glint off in the distance. Off they go with their makeshift emotional therapy dog in tow and the days-long trek forces them to cuddle against the cold at night. And, all too soon, the movie takes a tumble from which it never recovers.  I should have known when Ben early on portentously utters, \u201cA heart is nothing but a muscle\u201d that this movie, just like the plane, was destined to crash. Not to spoil the ending, which is corny as a crate of Cracker Jack, but It seemed almost inevitable that Alex\u2019s perfectly nice yet bland fianc\u00e9 would be Dermot Mulroney. For him, such roles are like Morgan Freeman playing the president or God. Meanwhile, weep not for our stars. Winslet\u2019s career overcame the laborious \u201cLabor Day\u201d and Elba isn\u2019t going to let the deadly \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d get him down. Besides, once you realize that \u201cThe Mountain Between Us\u201d almost falls into the so-bad-it\u2019s-good category, it just might become destined for riff-worthy cultdom.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh", "Review": "After that summer, nothing would ever be the same again. Where have we seen that movie before? Most recently last week, in \"Adventureland,\" another movie set in 1980s. If you think about it, after every summer, nothing will ever be the same again. But \"The Mysteries of Pittsburgh\" has an unusually busy summer, in which a hero who is a blank slate gets scrawled all over with experiences. The movie is all the more artificial because it has been made with great, almost painful, earnestness. It takes a plot that would have been at home in a 1930s Warner Bros. social melodrama, adds sexuality and a little nudity, and Bob's your uncle. It's based on a 1988 novel by Michael Chabon, still much read and valued, but to call it \"inspired by\" would be a stretch. Hardly a thing happens that doesn't seem laid on to hurry along the hero's coming of age. Advertisement That hero is Art (Jon Foster), whose voiceover narration does not shy away from the obvious. He is the son of Joe Bechstein (Nick Nolte), a mobster of such stature that he has his own FBI shadows. Joe would like Art to follow him into the family business, but Art wants nothing to do with it. He'll become a broker, which in the 1980s was an honest trade. For the summer, he takes a job at a vast surplus bookstore, where the minimum wage allows him to lose himself. Life comes racing after him. Phlox (Mena Suvari), the store manager, pages him on the intercom for sex on demand in the stock room. At a party, he meets the winsome blond Jane (Sienna Miller), whose boyfriend, Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard), is both friendly and disturbing. These two mess with his mind, Jane although she doesn't mean to, Cleveland because he is a sadistic emotional manipulator. The first little \"joke\" Cleveland plays on Art should have sent Art running as far from Cleveland as he could get. But Art is pathologically passive; the summer happens to him, but he can't be said to happen to it. Complications ensue from countless other movies: the fraught relationship with his father. Phlox's possessiveness. Jane's ambivalence. Cleveland's odd promotion of an emotional, if not at first sexual, menage a trois. Then a crime-driven climax that arrives out of thin air and involves a very small world indeed. Finally a bittersweet closing narration that seems to tie up loose ends but really answers nothing about Art, except whether he still lives in Pittsburgh. Complicating all this are some well-developed performances for such an underdeveloped screenplay. Peter Sarsgaard is intriguing as the seductive, profoundly screwy Cleveland. Mena Suvari is pitch-perfect in a finally thankless role. Nick Nolte, in expensive suits, hair slicked back, takes no nonsense as the hard mob boss. Sienna Miller is sweet but is never allowed to make clear why she is attracted to either man. Jon Foster, as the feckless protagonist, is the latest in a long line of manipulated male ingenues going back beyond Benjamin in \"The Graduate.\" This is a guy who hardly deserves the attention of the other characters in the story, with his closed-in, inarticulate, low self-esteem. At the end, Art is supposed to have learned lessons in life from his \"last summer before life begins.\" The melancholy likelihood is, however, that he learned nothing except the punch line to the old joke, \"Don't do that no more.\" At summer's end, he seems poised to graduate directly into the Lonely Crowd. There is an old word: nebbish. It is still a good word."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Transporter 3", "Review": "\"Transporter 3\" is a perfectly acceptable brainless action thriller, inspiring us to give a lot of thought to complex sequences we would have been better off sucking on as eye candy. Consider this ingenious dilemma faced by the Transporter. He cannot remove a bracelet that is linked to a mighty bomb in his Audi A8. If he goes more than 75 feet from the car, the explosion kills him. He and the car and the Girl are trapped on a bridge by men with machine guns. He releases the Girl. The men are shooting at him. How can he escape? Advertisement Remember, this is the Transporter. He completes 100 percent of his deliveries. If he told you his FedEx tracking number, he would have to kill you. Because we know it's impossible to kill an action hero with machine gun fire, he is in no real danger. But as men advance on him from both ends of the bridge, he has to do something to keep up appearances. He can't just wait for them to fire on him point-blank. For that matter, the bad guys know their machine guns are impotent because they have both ends of the bridge blocked and haven't been hit by each other's bullets. But what does the Transporter do? Steers hard to the left, drives through the bridge rail and plunges into the lake. Now we're talking real trouble. If he swims for the shore, the bomb will kill him. The only answer is to take the car to the shore with him, while holding his breath. He improvises a way to get air underwater. It's clever, but I wouldn't advise you to try it while underwater. Anyway, the plot involves bad guys who want to bring eight container ships of toxic poisons into a Ukrainian harbor. Odessa has a beautiful harbor, some nice steps leading down to the water. But the Ukrainian minister (Jeroen Krabbe) doesn't want to give his permission. The bad guys kidnap the Girl (Natalya Rudakova), and the Transporter's job is to transport her for the bad guys, although he begins to care for her. Rudakova is no Bonnie Hunt when it comes to personality. She skulks, pouts, clams up, looks out the window, and yet falls in love with the Transporter. Some perfectionists will no doubt criticize her acting. I say the hell with her acting. Look at those freckles. I can never get enough of freckles. In the movies, they're usually limited to a sprinkling on a moppet nose. When you see a beautiful woman with freckles, as for example, the adorable actress Julianne Nicholson, you rejoice. The director of \"Transporter 3,\" Olivier Megaton, is named after the bomb at Hiroshima, which was dropped on his birthday. (The Transporter's real name is the anti-climactic Frank Martin.) Anyway, although Megaton's CGI fight scenes are as chopped up and incomprehensible as the current norm, he mostly avoids the Queasy-Cam and uses a stable camera while only the action moves. How about that. Advertisement He also succeeds in clearing every highway in every chase scene so the road is held only by the chasers and the chasees. Except when two monster trucks are required to speed this way, in which case, although there has been no traffic since the border, they must pass each other and loudly toot their klaxons ooo-gaah! ooo-gaah! as if you don't see them. This movie is not boring. Jason Statham is a splendid action hero, steely-eyed, muscular, taciturn, a close-lipped know-it-all with three-day stubble. He could do the snowmobile race with two broken arms. The bad guys are suitably reprehensible, the photography is expert, and when you see the Transporter thinking his way out of that problem on the bottom of the lake, you're amazed that later he restarts the engine and uses it to drive onto the top of a speeding train and then calculates a way to use the train's speed to save ... but see for yourself. That A8, what a car. Solar panels to run the heat and A/C."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Byzantium", "Review": "All I knew going into \"Byzantium\" was that it marks director Neil Jordan's return to the genre he and novelist Anne Rice helped make viable for Hollywood studios almost twenty years ago, with \"Interview with the Vampire.\" This was not an enticement.\u00a0I find the entertainment industry's ongoing vampire gold rush, and pop culture's fascination with sexualized gore in general, to be insipid, boring and ghoulish in a trivial way that's unique to folks who haven't experienced much real violence or loss: goth slumber party.\u00a0What a pleasure it was, then, to be won over by this exquisite, lovely film, in which contemporary characters struggle to suspend their disbelief in vampire lore while Jordan's eye for formal beauty and truthful performances suspends ours.\u00a0There is\u00a0a very true moment\u00a0in David O. Russell's film \"The Fighter\" where Amy Adams is trying to stay angry and distrustful of her pathetic junkie brother-in-law Christian Bale but her heart can't help but reach out to him when he pleads sincerely for understanding. Noticing some cake icing smeared on his forearm, she says, \"What's that blue shit on your arm?\" with irritation melting into concern. That's how this bluesy vampire melodrama \"Byzantium\" worked on me. Advertisement The plot is almost irrelevant, but the way screenwriter Moira Buffini (adapting her own stage play \"A Vampire Story\") weaves threads of history, folklore, feminist spirit and universal themes is striking. The vamps we're obliged to care about here are a pair of traveling female hustlers who've spent centuries navigating a man's world using their wits and wiles with cruel precision. The elder of the duo, Clara (Gemma Arterton), pays the rent working a profession even older than vampirism. She's built for it: Clara is a luscious Amazonian stunner who doesn't need the powers of hell to put men into a trance. In the era of superheroes tossing around CGI skyscrapers, we forget the visceral power of human beauty, ardently photographed. Here Jordan, costume designer Consolota Boyle, production designer Simon Elliot, and genius director of photography Sean Bobbit (\"Hunger\") conspire to hold us in thrall every time Arterton appears. Whether in a bodice and shawl or a skintight number and stilettos, she doesn't move through the frame so much as slip into it and lead it gently along, the same way she coaxes men to give up their money and their lives. Arterton's sarcastic sauciness is a wonder. So is Saoirse Ronan's angelic brooding as the younger vampire, Eleanor. Closeups of Ronan stricken with grief, longing or deep reflection are simply startling. In one shot in which she's seized by a vision, her azure eyes, chestnut hair and red riding hood seem to linger after the shot is gone.  Jordan's casting choices, down to the smallest role, are inspired in their realism, particularly Caleb Landry Jones as Frank, the shy, ailing neighborhood boy Eleanor falls in love with against her centuries-honed judgment. Frank is pale and fragile, with an endearingly homely/handsome face that comes alive whenever Eleanor is around. I looked at this kid and I heard Otis Redding singing to his woman. Advertisement Ronan and Jones take us through the tender rites and crossed signals and yearnings of young love. It's an exquisitely sweet, sad portrait of two outcasts desperate for a connection. Unlike Eleanor, Frank may not have spent hundreds of years forced to keep his distance from people, but for all his angst, it may as well have been a thousand. Jordan lets these moments breathe, and his actors don't reach for the notes, simply finding them in each other's eyes. After the masterful Swedish and American adaptations of John Adjvide Lindquist's novel \"Let the Right One In,\" it's a surprise how well \"Byzantium\" treads on their turf and extends it even further into the world of grownups. The teen romance plays out against a backdrop of adults constantly faced with excruciating choices and sacrifices. Buffini's story deepens as it unfolds, putting Clara's apparent recklessness and psychopathic self-interest in a different light. An old boy's network of ghouls is tracking her, waiting for her to commit the slightest infraction as an excuse to terminate her membership and thus her and Eleanor's immortality. (If Hillary Clinton already has a favorite vampire movie, \"Byzantium\" is about to replace it.) \"Byzantium\" rejects a popular method of establishing realism in recent escapist films: recording the action with multiple handheld cameras, like a street fight captured by various iPhones. While exploiting the textures of weathered real-world locations as flavorfully as the kitchen sink realist Ken Loach, Jordan and Bobbit stick to elegant, balanced movements and classical editing that make even a bumpy foot chase feel like a waltz. The color palette of rust, teal and chalk white put everything in grand, haunting relief. Javier Navarette's mournful score is the blue icing on the cake. So, given all the enthusiasm expressed above, why do I begrudge this movie a half a star instead of giving it an even four? Well, the violence. Jim Carrey recently renounced his participation in the upcoming violence fest \"Kick-Ass 2,\" citing a \"change of heart\" in the wake of the Sandy Hook killings. I feel the same sick lament at \"Byzantium\"'s graphic beheadings and throat-slashings. It's a crude way to goose the audience, given Jordan's fine touch. It's not just that people who get off on such gotchas could more directly whet their appetites by watching real slaughters on YouTube. Pornographic violence has been mainstream in movies since the late 1960's, and it's one of those tiresome relics that could easily go the way of Stepin Fetchit and married characters in separate beds. Filmmakers with no craft or imagination and generous budgets use it out of desperation. Sure, Jordan uses it here with a lot more artistry, often in response to operatic emotions, as when he positions a severed head on a stair step during a heartwarming moment (for a bit of Paul Verhoeven-like poetic irony). Viewers who will inevitably pick apart this film's plot inconsistencies while failing to note its graceful curves will consider the killings the film's bright spots, so perhaps it made commercial sense to include them.\u00a0But it's still far too cheap in effect for what it costs in encouraging an already coarsened multiplex crowd to view human carnage with a butcher's yawn.\u00a0 Sorry to go off on a tangent, but \"Byzantium\" is the kind of film that provokes such weird sensitivity.\u00a0It's a reminder that even escapist fantasies reach into real life, whether it's to give or to steal.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Happy Valley", "Review": "The location that gives \"Happy Valley\" its title is never meant \r\nto be bitterly ironic; it just turned out that way. The movie's \r\ndirector, Amir Bar-Lev (\"The Tillman Story,\" \"My Kid Could Paint That\"), \r\ndoesn't push the irony. He doesn't push anything, really. He just \r\nrecounts the whole sordid story of the Penn State football scandal \r\nagain, then draws, or tries to draw, some lessons from it.\u00a0 A\r\n few of the lessons we've already heard, and hopefully memorized, if we \r\ndidn't know them already. One is that sexual predators don't tend to \r\nlurk in dark alleyways like cartoon gargoyles, looking for children to \r\nkidnap; they're more likely to hide in plain sight, as the Penn State \r\nfootball program's assistant coach Jerry Sandusky did for so many years,\r\n setting himself up as a model citizen and surrogate father to \r\ngenerations of young men, the better to satisfy his compulsions. (There \r\nare many unsettling images in this film, but the TV news footage and \r\nstill photos of Sandusky's summer camp for boys ranks near the top.)\u00a0 Advertisement Another\r\n lesson is that when a crime is committed, an institution tends to view \r\nreporting it to proper authorities as a last resort. This was \r\ndemonstrated during the investigations into Sandusky's crimes by law \r\nenforcement and the National College Athletics Association. A trail of \r\nemails later revealed that the school's beloved football coach, Joe \r\nPaterno\u2014who reigned over the program for 46 years and died of cancer in \r\n2012, not long after the scandal broke\u2014reported Sandusky to the school \r\nas he was supposed to, then backpedaled and colluded with school \r\nadministrators to keep the abuse a secret so as not to jeopardize the \r\nteam's momentum, the community's pride or the school's finances and \r\nreputation.\u00a0 A third lesson is that when sports\r\n and community pride fuse, as they so often do in college sports-crazy \r\ncommunities, fans just absolutely, positively do not want to hear any \r\nbad news about their team, and tend to avoid it, deny it, minimize it, \r\nor verbally lawyer it away on technicalities. We see the latter \r\nhappening again when reporters\u2014or average citizens who accept that \r\nSandusky committed crimes and Paterno helped cover them up\u2014tell die-hard\r\n Penn State boosters that the school failed its athletes and therefore \r\ndeserves the abuse, scorn and penalties heaped on it, only to be met with \r\nsome variation of, \"Well, Paterno reported it, what more do you want?\" \r\nor \"Those crimes don't have anything to do with the great legacy of Penn\r\n State football.\"\u00a0 \"Happy Valley\" wades into \r\nmore problematic waters when it gets into the subject of guilt by \r\nassociation, and a community's related attempts to deal with scandal by \r\nsimply obliterating any trace of the people who initiated it. Much is \r\nmade here of whether the NCAA was right to take many seasons worth of \r\nPaterno's wins away from him, to send a message about the moral severity\r\n of the offense that he and his colleagues committed by participating in\r\n a cover-up. The program's partisans argue that Sandusky's crimes and \r\nthe program's complicity didn't necessarily contribute to the school's \r\nwon-lost record, and suggesting that they do only confuses the issues. \r\nThere are points where the director seems to be questioning the logic of\r\n that decision as well, even linking it subtly to the community's \r\nattempts to eradicate images and sculptures of Sandusky and Paterno from\r\n local buildings and streets.\u00a0 Advertisement Related to this \r\nis the sense that the entire community, which knew nothing of Sandusky's\r\n crimes or the university's role in hiding them, is being punished along\r\n with the conspirators, by having the Penn State football program taken \r\naway, the athletic records punitively altered, and the words \"Happy \r\nValley\" linked inextricably with sickness, cowardice and evil. What's \r\nthe community's crime, they wonder? Loving football too much?\u00a0 That's\r\n actually an excellent question, not nearly as loaded or defensive as it\r\n sounds. One could make the case that football is the United States of \r\nAmerica's one true religion, the thing that brings everyone together, if\r\n only for a few hours a week, and when a religion is threatened, \r\nthe faithful band together and refuse to listen to reason, and view any \r\nattempt to demand moral accountability from the exemplars of their faith\r\n as a form of blasphemy, or a collective assault.\u00a0 The movie \r\ninvites such comparisons by subtly (and sometimes unsubtly) likening \r\nAmerican football to religion, and its coaches, assistant coaches and \r\nadministrators to church officials entrusted with the care and guidance \r\nof young men. Echoes of the Roman \r\nCatholic Church's sexual abuse scandals are ever-present. When Happy \r\nValley residents discuss and argue the particulars of the Penn State \r\nscandal, you sometimes hear a catch in their voices, or see tears \r\nwelling in their eyes, because their values have been betrayed, or \r\nbecause their unshakable faith in the goodness of the program has opened\r\n them to ridicule and shame, and they know it.\u00a0 It's\r\n slightly frustrating that the movie doesn't venture a point-of-view on \r\nany of these larger issues, which are less clear cut than the matters of\r\n sexual abuse and its immediate enablers. But it's also understandable, \r\nbecause what could \"Happy Valley\" conclude, ultimately? Any summation \r\nmight have seemed glib or sanctimonious. We're left instead with \r\ntroubling questions that might not ever yield satisfying answers."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "I Am Michael", "Review": "\"Not everyone wants to be part of the subculture,\" insists Michael Glatze (James Franco), in writer-director Justin Kelly's feature debut \"I Am Michael.\" (\"I Am Michael\" played at Sundance two years ago. Since then, \"King Cobra,\" Kelly's second film, has been released). Glatze is trying to convince his colleagues at the San-Francisco based gay magazine XY that the \"gay identity\" as it is understood is limiting and should be rejected. His colleagues look at him like they don't know what he's talking about, but it's just the beginning phase of the transformation of their activist friend. Michael Glatze was (and still is) a real person, and he is the subject of \"I Am Michael,\" a quiet film that attempts to understand Glatze's journey to becoming what was called in fundamentalist Christian circles an \"ex-gay.\" Glatze's story always had its fascination to those looking on as it unfolded in real time. What happened? How could this happen?\u00a0 Advertisement Michael Glatze was a highly visible member of the LGBTQ community through his work with XY, as well as the magazine he founded that focused on outreach to young people, Young Gay Americans. In July 2007, he wrote an article on WorldNet Daily announcing that he had converted to Christianity and was no longer a homosexual. He still had yearnings towards men but he worked to suppress them. \"Reparation therapy\" (as practiced by Love Wins Out and Exodus International\u2014both organizations now-defunct and debunked by their own founders) was not part of Glatze's journey, although he put himself through a similarly rigorous process of de-programming. When Glatze \"came out\" as \"ex-gay,\" he became a hero in Christian, a villain in LGBTQ circles. His transformation was hurtful to those who looked to him for leadership as well as to those who knew him personally, like his boyfriend Ben. Kelly's script is based on Benoit Denizet-Lewis' 2011 New York Times article called \"My Ex-Gay Friend\". You can see why Kelly was attracted to the story as told there. It's epic in scope.\u00a0 \"I Am Michael\" starts with a chilling scene where a clean-cut buttoned-up Michael tells a troubled teen in a counseling session that it's possible to get past one's homosexual yearnings. There is hope, in other words. Cut to an earlier time in Michael's life, where he and his boyfriend Bennett (a wonderful Zachary Quinto) dance at a rave, pop Ecstasy, have a hot threesome. They are, as a friend of mine calls them, \"A-List gays.\" A power couple. Bennett is an architect, and Michael works at XY, arguing in editorial meetings that \"being attracted to the same sex doesn't define who you are.\" Michael and Bennett travel cross-country, making a documentary about gay youth in areas far from liberal coastal hubs. \"This is Falwell Territory,\" Michael says. In one small town, Glatze witnesses a young gay kid comforting a sad friend with a prayer to Jesus on her behalf. Michael is struck by this, it challenges his assumptions that being gay and being Christian cannot co-exist. When he believes he has developed the heart condition that killed his father, his fear of death and his yearning for more from his life leads him into what can only be described as a conversion experience.\u00a0 Justin Kelly takes a non-judgmental approach to the story, especially by keeping the film solely in Michael's point of view. There's a very effective sequence where Michael, after writing the article announcing he had given up homosexuality, is bombarded with images on his laptop of all of the headlines, Christian sites crowing in triumph that Jesus really does save, gay outlets howling in outrage. Michael reads the reactions, looking freaked out and terrified at what he might have unleashed. Franco obviously has great compassion for Glatze's inner torment. Michael seems lost. An orphan in the world. Looking for a place to belong. Quinto gives a subtle and deeply pained portrayal of a boyfriend who watches his partner vanish before his eyes. You never doubt the connection between the two men, their loving and deep relationship as a couple. It's necessary to get a sense of that so that what follows has the proper impact, and Kelly navigates those waters with his cast sensitively and well. In Franco's hands, Glatze is an inquiring and dogged iconoclast, pre-and post-conversion. As a gay man, he immersed himself in queer theory. As an \"ex-gay,\" he immersed himself in theology. His mindset was naturally extreme, the pendulum swinging far in each direction. It's not difficult to believe Franco as an intelligent and well-read man (despite the fact that he's played so many goofballs).\u00a0 Advertisement There are a couple of visual flourishes that are awkwardly executed and unnecessary (heads placed in the far corners of the frame, a couple of overhead shots that come from out of nowhere). There are some issues with establishing chronology as well as location. The action moves from Halifax to Colorado to San Francisco, and it's not entirely clear where anyone is at any given moment in time. Kelly is finding his sea-legs as a director. Kelly spends equal amounts of time with Michael's pre-conversion life as he does post-conversion. The conversion itself is pretty well done, all things considered. (Filming a man suddenly being filled with the love of Jesus is probably quite a challenge.) A fascinating detail of Franco's performance is that before the conversion his face is humorous and beautiful, his smile ready, and even in the midst of an argument he's open to all possibilities. He loves the fight. Post-conversion, a mask descends. There's a constant deeply-grooved wrinkle in his forehead. This is a man who cannot let himself be. Who has chosen to suppress who he is. You can see\u00a0the price he has paid for that suppression on his face. It's extremely sad."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Che", "Review": "Che Guevara is conventionally depicted either as a saint of revolution, or a ruthless executioner. Steven Soderbergh's epic biography \"Che\" doesn't feel the need to define him. It is not written from the point of view of history, but from Guevara's own POV on a day-to-day basis in the process of overthrowing the Batista regime in Cuba and then failing to repeat his success in Bolivia. Both parts of the film are based on his writings, including a diary in Bolivia written in the field, day to day. Advertisement The film plays in two parts, named \"The Argentine\" and \"Guerrilla.\" It resists the temptation to pump up the volume, to outline Che (Benicio Del Toro) against the horizon, to touch conventional biographical bases. In Cuba, we join him in mid-stream. We learn that he is a doctor, but not how and why he became one. It is a given that he is a revolutionary. He is a natural leader of men. Fidel Castro is his comrade, but the film does not show them in a detailed relationship; much of the time, they are apart. There isn't an explanation of why he chose to secretly leave Cuba after the revolution, no reference to his time in the Congo, no explanation about why he chose Bolivia as his next field of operations, no reference to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across South America (as described in the 2004 film \"The Motorcycle Diaries\"). \"Che\" is all in the present tense. He has made an irrevocable decision to overthrow governments, he explains why in his descriptions of injustice, he identifies with peasants and not with his own ruling class, and although he is nominally a Communist, we do not hear discussion of theory and ideology. He seems completely focused on the task immediately before him. His method is to give voice to popular resentment against a dictator, win the support of the people and demoralize opposing armies of unenthusiastic soldiers. He needs few men because he has a powerful idea behind him. That method worked in Cuba and failed in Bolivia. Soderbergh's 258-minute film works as an arc: Upward to victory, a pause with his family in Argentina, downward to defeat. The scenes in Argentina show him with his second wife, Aleida (Catalina Sandino Moreno), and children, but do not engage in why he left them, how his wife really feels, how he feels about them. A wanted person, he has disguised himself so successfully that his children do not recognize him as he presides over the dinner table. His wife shared his political ideas but must have had deep feelings about a man who would leave his children to lead a revolutionary war in another country; but we don't hear them, and in a way it's a relief to be spared the conventional scenes of recrimination. It is all as it is. Advertisement That helps explain another peculiarity of the film. Surprising attention is given to Che meeting the volunteers who join his guerrilla bands. Names, embraces. But little effort is made to single them out as individuals, to develop complex relationships. Che enforces an inviolable rule: He will leave no wounded man behind. But there is no sense that he is personally emotionally involved with his men. It is a man he will not leave behind, not this man. It is the idea. In Cuba, the rebels are greeted by the people of the villages, given food and cover, cheered on in what becomes a triumphal tour. In Bolivia, there seems little sympathy. Villagers betray him. They conceal government troops, not his own. When he lectures on the injustice of the government medical system, his audience seems unresponsive. You cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to follow. Soderbergh shows U.S. military advisers working with the Bolivians, but doesn't blame the United States for Che's failure. Che chose the wrong war at the wrong time and place. In showing both wars, Soderbergh does an interesting thing. He doesn't structure his battle scenes as engagements with clear-cut outcomes. Che's men ambush and are ambushed. They trade fire with distant enemies. There is usually a cut to the group in the aftermath of battle, its casualties not lingered over. This is not a war movie. It is about one man's unrealistic compulsion to stay his course. Soderbergh made the film himself, directing, photographing, editing. There is no fancy camerawork; he looks steadily at Che's dogged determination. There are very few subjective shots, but they are effective; Che's POV during his last moments, for example. There is a lot of the countryside, where these men live for weeks at a time. The overwhelming impression is of exhaustion, and Guevara himself has malaria part of the time, and suffered from asthma. There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come, and more doomed than one whose time is not now. Benicio Del Toro, one of the film's producers, gives a heroic performance, not least because it's self-effacing. He isn't foregrounded like most epic heroes. In Cuba, he emerges in victory, in Bolivia, he is absorbed in defeat, and sometimes is almost hard to recognize behind a tangle of beard and hair. He embodies not so much a personality as a will. You may wonder if the film is too long. I think there's a good reason for its length. Guevara's experience in Cuba and especially Bolivia was not a series of events and anecdotes, but a trial of endurance that might almost be called mad. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Beloved", "Review": "\"Beloved\" is a labyrinth of French love stories that wind their way from 1968 to the near-present, pausing along the way to employ the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia and the 9/11 attacks as historical backdrops. It uses Catherine Deneuve and her real-life daughter Chiara Mastroianni as Madeleine and her daughter Vera, and Ludivine Sagnier as a younger version of Madeleine. The film opens with a French cover of Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walking,\" as a narration by Vera explains how her mother stole a pair of high-fashion shoes and was mistaken for a hooker. Madeleine paused a moment, thought why not? and later tells Vera that the shoes were responsible for making her a prostitute. In this new career, she meets a young Czech doctor named Jaromil (Rasha Bukvic), falls in love with him, breaks up, follows him to Czechoslovakia, marries him and has their daughter, Vera. Later in life, he reappears, now played by Czech director Milos Forman. Advertisement Are you with me? One of the charms of \"Beloved\" is the way it uses movie legends. Deneuve and Forman you know. You also know Chiara Mastroianni, whose father was Marcello Mastroianni. After dozens of movies, I am so intensely familiar with the faces of Deneuve and Mastroianni that it is a thing of beauty to see both their faces reflected in hers. No one would ever say \"she looks like her father\" or \"her mother.\" She looks like both, the heiress of cinematic royalty. What does the writer-director Christophe Honor\u00e9 do with these characters and their casting? With the casting, he has no problem. His actresses are all wondrous to behold, and Forman is surprisingly engaging as the doctor. But the plot of \"Beloved,\" I'm afraid, may try your patience.  Both Madeleine and Vera have a gift for choosing unreliable men. With Vera, it is a gay American named Henderson (Paul Schneider) and Clement (Louis Garrel), her patient best friend. They choose them, and choose them again and again, and spend the movie steeping in melancholy and futility. There is another problem. Honor\u00e9 puts his film on hold six or seven times while the characters half-sing, half-recite the lyrics to banal songs explaining the meaning of what we've just seen, which is all too comprehensible the first time around.  \"Beloved\" evokes some of the fine moments in the careers of Deneuve and Marcello Mastroianni, but it doesn't re-create them."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Flipped", "Review": "There are moments in adolescence when your feelings about romance turn on a dime. Maybe it's hormonal. The girl you thought was a pest becomes the object of your dreams. The boy you've had a crush on for years begins to seem like a jerk. The timing is off. Sometimes you can look back half a lifetime and see how things might have happened differently if you hadn't been so stupid. Rob Reiner's \"Flipped\" does the looking. Here is a lovely movie about a girl who has adored a boy ever since he moved into the neighborhood in the second grade. She even likes his smell, and it is true we cannot love someone who isn't aromatic to our hearts. All through grade school and into high school, she pursues him; they're like the runners in Keats' \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn\u201d who pursue each other for eternity without ever drawing closer. In Reiner's film, they flip and start running in the other direction. Advertisement Madeline Carroll plays Juli Baker, who was determined to get Bryce Loski (Callan McAuliffe) to like her when they were kids, but in eighth grade has turned her attention to more urgent matters, like sparing the life of the beautiful sycamore tree in her front yard. It is threatened with being chopped down by the forces of evil, and she climbs it and won't come down. That shows some character, muses Bryce's grandfather Chet (John Mahoney). If he were Bryce, he'd notice a girl like that. Bryce begins to catch on. There are difficulties and the possibility of heartbreak. There always are in high school. You wear your sleeve on your heart. There are parents. Not everybody has parents like \"Juno\" did. If Juno had ordinary parents, her story would be a grim morality play. But \"Flipped\" doesn't haul in standard parents of teenagers. Reiner wisely casts gifted actors (Aidan Quinn and Penelope Ann Miller as the Bakers, and Anthony Edwards and Rebecca De Mornay as the Loskis). He knows that Mahoney can save a wise grandfather from cornball with sheer brute force of niceness.  There's a screenplay device by Reiner and Andrew Scheinman, based on the novel by Wendelin Van Draanan, that could be arduous but works here because it has been thought through. The key events in the film are seen from both points of view: Bryce's and Juli's. Teenagers often lose the beat emotionally, and these two need John Philip Sousa. There isn't trickery: The scenes happen as they seem to, and not in alternate universes. But they seem so different, depending on who is seeing them. There's one of those events so beloved by teenage girls in which they can exact excruciating embarrassment on boys while seeming to be blithely unaware. The boys are auctioned off to the girls as lunch room partners to raise money for charity. Yeah, that's what a guy wants, to stand onstage while the most patronizing teacher in the school handles the bidding. Of course, it all goes tragically wrong for Juli and Bryce, but for what seems like different reasons. Advertisement Reiner sets most of the movie in 1963 (his classic \"Stand by Me,\" is set a few years earlier, in 1959), and I don't think it's just for nostalgia. In a way, that's the last year of American teenage innocence, before the '60s took hold. Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe, who both look teeth-achingly vulnerable, are sincere and pure and wholesome, and are characters we believe can be hurt. Some of today's teenagers are more wounded and cynical than their parents ever were. And for some of them sex is not an undiscovered country. Maybe what makes \"Flipped\" such a warm entertainment is how it re-creates a life we wish we'd had when we were 14. That's true for adults, and also I suspect true for some 14-year-olds. In a way the audience flips, too."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Mudbound", "Review": "\u201cMudbound\u201d is all about perception. How it can foster empathy and engender contempt, sometimes in the same person. How it can cause one man to look at his land with life-affirming pride and another man to see that same plot as the kiss of death. How an act of wartime courage involving a red-tailed plane and a dark-skinned pilot can forever alter one\u2019s opinion of a different race. And how a society can impose unfair, harmful and absurd restrictions on an entire group simply because those people are seen as inferior by the powers that be. The film invites us to observe its characters, to hear their inner voices, to see what they see and to challenge our own preconceived notions about race and gender. Advertisement This is a period piece that evokes the grand family epics of old Hollywood, most specifically George Stevens\u2019 1956 film \u201cGiant.\u201d Like George Stevens\u2019 Oscar winner, \u201cMudbound\u201d is based on a novel and concerns itself with two families living uneasily on the same land. Director Dee Rees masterfully executes her character study, filling the frame with visuals as big and powerful as the emotions she draws from her superb cast. This is melodrama of the highest order, which is a compliment, for melodrama is not a bad thing. It is part of some of the greatest works of art, and in the right hands, it can elicit an ennui-shattering response from the audience. We will follow two families, the Jacksons, who are Black, and the McAllans, who are White. The McAllan patriarch, Henry (Jason Clarke) is forced to interact with the Jacksons after he is suckered into a deal to buy land that the seller does not legally own. Henry\u2019s embarrassment is amplified by the taunting rants of his racist father Pappy (Jonathan Banks) and the notion that he has to move into an area designated for a lower class of Whites than he believes himself to be. Henry is constantly reminded of his downgraded stature by the repeated appearances of Vera Atwood (Lucy Faust), a struggling, poor White woman whom he deludes himself into thinking is below his station. Vera is Henry\u2019s ghost of Christmas Future, a reminder that he is one mistake away from her desperate existence. For these reasons, Henry despises the land where he resides. By comparison, pastor Hap Jackson (Rob Morgan) looks at his little plot of land as a gift from God, a blessing that actually elevates his stature from that of his ancestors who couldn\u2019t own land at all. It may be a harsh, at times unforgiving piece of Earth, but he has some form of ownership, no matter how tenuous. Even though Henry has commandeered it mostly for himself, leaving Hap to sharecrop it for diminishing returns, Hap still finds joy, solace and meaning in his farm work. As a Black man in post-WWII America, Hap has become accustomed to making due with even the smallest scraps of good fortune, no matter how infuriating they may seem. Hap is an experienced veteran of the war with Jim Crow; he has bent his anger into a strong, almost impenetrable suit of stoic armor whose weak spots are known only by his loving wife, Florence (Mary J. Blige). Advertisement Henry also has a wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan). Through her story, we first become aware that \u201cMudbound\u201d presents its characters in parallel sets of two. (Rachel Morrison\u2019s cinematography also works in this fashion\u2014notice how each family\u2019s house is lit.) Laura\u2019s partner in this arrangement is Florence, another mother who, like Laura, has the socially accepted role of subservience to her man. Both Florence and Laura buck this trend by disobeying their husbands. They also share a moment of grief that bonds them as only two mothers can bond. As the elder of the two, Florence exhibits a maternal instinct toward Laura. Laura also gets the first of the film\u2019s internal monologues, moments of voiceover that Rees wrote with Virgil Williams in the adaptation of Hillary Jordan\u2019s novel. Most of the characters have soliloquys that allow us a temporarily omniscient point of view. They provide invaluable information in a fashion that is at times achingly poetic yet completely natural. Florence\u2019s words are especially powerful, rendered by Blige in an excellent performance that mixes the stoicism of Gloria Foster in \u201cNothing But a Man\u201d with the mischievous twinkle that occasionally popped into a young Cicely Tyson's eye when her characters thought nobody was looking. Florence and the rest of Hap\u2019s family will be called upon several times to assist the McAllans. Henry\u2019s demands are always delivered in a manner that on the surface sounds like a polite request, yet his tone of voice always stresses that saying no to a White man is not an option. Clarke delivers these lines in squirm-inducing fashion, though the level of discomfort depends on your perception\u2014you may not feel it at all. And though it would appear that Henry has some regard for his counterpart, it becomes clear that he views Hap as too inferior to earn any empathy. Still, \u201cMudbound\u201d doesn\u2019t treat him as a standard-issue villain; his inner monologues and his interactions with Laura give him a complexity that allows us to understand his actions. Advertisement Part of that understanding comes from observing Pappy, a drunk who raised his sons to capitalize on the best White supremacy and privilege have to offer. Pappy has no internal monologues because he\u2019s all surface. His inner voice would sound as racist, corrupt and disgusting as the things everyone hears him say out loud. Banks makes him more than just a one-note character; he\u2019s genuinely menacing and scary enough to dissuade Henry from any sort of racial growth. Henry is bound to his father by guilt, taking him in even when Laura would rather have him burn in Hell, but Henry\u2019s brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) manages to escape long enough to have an unexpected change of heart as far as Black people are concerned. Unfortunately for Jamie, his escape was World War II. Florence\u2019s son, Ronsel (Jason Mitchell) also served in World War II, battling the Germans and becoming the lover of a German woman he met overseas. He returns to a country that not only refuses to thank him for his service, but also expects him to return to second-class citizenry once he\u2019s back on U.S. soil. The fact that Ronsel is treated better in the enemy country than his own is not lost on us. It will be underlined twice in the film\u2019s bittersweet ending. Ronsel\u2019s scenes with the White townsfolk upon his return are an unsubtle reminder that the America we\u2019re seeing in this film is the one that certain voters want to bring back into existence. Jamie and Ronsel bond over their shared war experiences, though initially, Ronsel is skeptical and worried about Jamie\u2019s intentions. Jamie tells him that a Tuskegee Airman saved his ass in a dogfight, and that changed his perspective on race. Their friendship is anchored by war stories and booze, of which Jamie drinks too much to drown out symptoms of his PTSD. Nobody understands this the way Ronsel does, but their relationship immediately casts a sense of dread over the film. This progressive partnership is a dangerous one, because Jamie\u2019s a loose cannon and Ronsel is unwilling to go back to racist rules now that he\u2019s had a taste of freedom. So when \u201cMudbound\u201d becomes terrifyingly violent, we have been prepped for it. Rees handles this, and the subsequent vengeance that follows, with amazing restraint, keeping it from becoming exploitative without diminishing any of its shock value. Advertisement Though \u201cMudbound\u201d presents most of its story and its characters in parallels of two, Ronsel is the one character who shares traits with other characters. Like Florence, he has both a charitable and a stubborn streak, which is evidenced in a wonderful scene where he buys her a bar of chocolate. When Florence intends to break it into pieces and give it to her other kids, Ronsel demands that she keep the entire thing for herself. Have a taste of your own freedom, just as I had for myself in the service, he seems to say to her. It\u2019s a well-played small moment in a movie filled with them. While the entire cast is superb, \u201cMudbound\u201d belongs to Blige, Mitchell and Hedlund. Hedlund\u2019s roguish performance is a loose, sexy throwback to Errol Flynn and James Dean\u2014he would have been right at home in front of George Stevens\u2019 camera or underscored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Blige is a revelation. And Mitchell deservingly earns the film\u2019s last internal monologue, a quiet, bittersweet and moving meditation on choosing love over hate that proves that Ronsel is the film\u2019s true hero. I don\u2019t know what Roger would have thought of \u201cMudbound.\" But I do know that it supports his thesis that movies are machines that generate empathy. I believe that viewers of different races will find different entry points into the film, but everyone will come out at the end with their viewpoints challenged and perhaps enriched. Rees and company have crafted an unforgettable plea for empathy and justice. This is not an easy film, but it\u2019s an essential one."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Girl Most Likely", "Review": "Kristen Wiig should, in theory, be able to elevate any film or show she's in simply by showing up and being her smart, clever, fearless self. With a well-timed deadpan aside or an amusingly awkward physical bit, she makes decent material better and good material great.  This is a notion that \"Girl Most Likely\" pushes to the absolute limits. Wiig finds herself sadly outmatched in this comedy crammed with wacky and tacky characters\u2014types, all of them\u2014in which she's stuck functioning as the uptight, frustrated straight woman in the middle. She rarely gets a chance to shine because her role is so underwritten.  Advertisement Husband-and-wife directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini have had success in the past with inspired subject matter, such as the excellent \"American Splendor\" from 2003. Here, they're working from a script by Michelle Morgan that's chock-full of contrived situations and very few moments that actually ring true.  It contains a menagerie of quirky weirdos: people we're clearly meant to laugh at for being ridiculous, delusional, pathetic or all of the above, up until the precise moment that we're supposed to join the film in doing a 180-degree turn and embracing them for being exactly who they are. This is the formulaic, inevitable journey Wiig's character, Imogene, must travel.  At the film's start, she's a well-to-do Manhattan magazine writer attending a society event with her obviously evasive longtime boyfriend. It's clear she doesn't quite fit in with these old-moneyed women, though\u2014she doesn't have the right pedigree or wear the right dress or say just the right, vapid thing in conversation.  With head-spinning swiftness, Imogene loses her boyfriend, job and apartment and fakes a suicide attempt, all of which plays out in broad, sitcommy fashion. And so this once-promising playwright must return to her hometown, a place she's been running from her whole adult life: the cheesy slab of boardwalk known as Ocean City, N.J. (In case we didn't know we were in New Jersey, \"Girl Most Likely\" features really obvious song choices on the soundtrack from both Bon Jovi AND Bruce Springsteen.) There, she is forced to coexist in a cramped, cluttered beach house with her blowsy, hard-gambling mother, Zelda (Annette Bening in a husky accent) and Zelda's younger boyfriend, an alleged CIA agent who goes by the name George Bousche (say it out loud). He's played by Matt Dillon. There's also Imogene's younger brother, Ralph (Christopher Fitzgerald), who's obsessed with crabs and appears to be mentally challenged in some unspecified way; and Lee (\"Glee\" star Darren Criss), the twenty-something who's renting out Imogene's childhood bedroom. Advertisement Bob Balaban gets even less to work with as Imogene and Ralph's father, whom they haven't seen in decades because their mother told them he was dead.\u00a0 This development is also supposed to be funny, and poignant, but never succeeds either way. It's not enough to assemble an esteemed cast\u2014you have to give them something worthwhile to, you know, do. Criss, in his first major role in a feature film, is the only person to emerge completely unscathed. While his character may seem impossibly sweet and charming, Criss has a natural likability and some nice chemistry with Wiig\u2014more so than anybody else in the cast, certainly. (\"Glee\" fans will be happy to know that the leader of the Warblers does indeed get to belt out a suddenly ubiquitous, '90s boy-band tune.) But the desperate straining for laughs isn't nearly so off-putting as the abrupt tonal shift \"Girl Most Likely\" makes as it trudges toward its conclusion. The film encourages us to enjoy feeling superior and smug to Imogene's relatives and their schlocky surroundings, just as she does, then goes all soft and gooey and wants us to love them. This is particularly difficult to do because they're not so much recognizable people as a collection of flimsy eccentricities, shriveling up in the sunshine of the Jersey shore."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Armor of Light", "Review": "\u201cThe Armor of Light\u201d begins with footage from a 1992 anti-abortion rally, in which one of the protest\u2019s leaders, a minister, is seen cradling a preserved human fetus in his hands. This gentleman, the Reverend Robert Schenck, happens to be the protagonist of the documentary.\u00a0 \n I\u2019ll put my cards on the table, for what it\u2019s worth. I\u2019m what some would call \u201cpro-choice\u201d and I am neither moved nor engaged by tactics such as the one used by Reverend Schenck. Regardless, one supposes that the footage does establish what some would call Schenck\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d credentials, and once the movie has done so, Schenck narrates an event that would change his life: the 1998 murder, or assassination if you please, of Dr. Bernard Slepian, an abortion provider who was killed by an anti-abortion activist. \u201cI was more than shocked, I was stunned,\u201d Schenck says, going on to say that he just couldn\u2019t believe that anyone \u201cpro-life\u201d would actually take a life. \u201cI was na\u00efve,\u201d he concludes. Gee, you think? Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it seems relatively clear that the rhetoric used by those from Schenck\u2019s camp is frequently on the heated-to-the-point-of-inflammatory side. There\u2019s not much hate-the-sin-love-the-sinner going on in this debate.\u00a0 Advertisement \n In any event, Schenck was genuinely moved, because he took a hard, detailed look at the gun culture within the wide-ranging evangelical community in the United States, and decided to \u2026 well, to question it. Schenck, as this documentary from co-directors Abigail Disney and Kathleen Hughes demonstrates, is not exactly an anti-gun crusader. Rather, he seeks to imbue a spirit of mindfulness to his flock. To just think about the potential contradictions within deeming oneself both \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-gun.\u201d For merely suggesting such a thing, he gets a lot of pushback.\u00a0 \n Intersecting Schenck\u2019s story is that of Lucia McBeth, a flight attendant whose son was shot to death by Michael Dunn after a service-station conflict over music coming from the vehicle in which victim Jordan Davis sat. Davis was African-American, Dunn white. Dunn invoked Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, which had recently served George Zimmerman so well, to justify his actions.\u00a0 \n So yes: this movie pokes its camera eye into about a dozen distinct forms of controversy. And yet \u201cThe Armor of Light\u201d is a calm, measured, and very visually attractive film (each and every shot that\u2019s not from archival or found footage is meticulously composed and executed; Disney & Hughes do NOT do \u201cB-roll\u201d), one that holds conclusions at arm\u2019s length.\u00a0 \n While drawing compelling portraits of Schenck, McBeth, and McBeth\u2019s family lawyer John Phillips, the movie also provides some peculiar glimpses into the aforementioned gun culture. Archival footage shows NRA head Wayne LaPierre proclaiming, \u201cThe only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.\u201d Later in the film, at a quiet meeting with fellow evangelicals (which opens with a prayer, even), an Operation Rescue member earnestly parrots those exact words to Schenck. It\u2019s like something out of \u201cThey Live,\u201d or Orwell. The same fellow also utters the catchphrase \u201cAn armed society is a polite society,\u201d and goes on to explain that two people who meet on the street who both know that the other is armed are not going to shoot each other, which begs the question of why they were going to shoot each other in the first place. In other scenes, several church-going folk discuss a fantasy scenario in which a child molester is luring a kid into a van but is stopped by a gun-toting parishioner. When has this ever happened, really? There\u2019s a tendency among some folks to try and bolster LaPierre\u2019s position by sending skeptics a blog post from Controversial Times, or some other highly reliable website, about the dozen or so times that a good guy with a gun HAS stopped a bad guy with a gun. I don\u2019t know what the actuarial tables make of this, given that the number of times this hasn\u2019t happened is well over a dozen but \u2026 oh, good grief.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Disney and Hughes' film, for all its evenhandedness of tone, is clearly in Schenck and particularly McBath\u2019s corner; it regards the conviction of Dunn as a triumph for common sense and justice. For all that, the film\u2019s calmness, and its roundabout approach to narrative\u2014somewhat unavoidable given the structure Disney & Hughes choose, which is to tell a lot of the story more or less as it happens rather than in retrospect\u2014diffuse some of its power. The overwhelming and slightly dispiriting (for this viewer, at least) note that \u201cThe Armor Of Light\u201d ends on is that the road ahead for Schenck is a long one, and the folks he wants to persuade along that road are not easily swayed from their reflexive disdain of a \u201cnanny state.\u201d"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "R.I.P.D.", "Review": "There's that silly, giddy moment in \"Men in Black\" where government agent Tommy Lee Jones deadpans to his rookie partner Will Smith, \"You need to learn to relax\u2026 take some joy in your work.\" They happen to be driving upside down on the roof of a tunnel at about 1,000 miles an hour while Smith freaks out. It's funny because director Barry Sonnenfeld, his actors, his editors and his f/x people knew something about comic timing. Robert Schwentke's \"R.I.P.D.\", which wants to be the new \"Men in Black\"\u2014a sleek pop special effects comedy\u2014has awful, awful timing. The only accurate timepieces in this adaptation of Peter M. Lenkov's comic are Jeff Bridges and Mary Louise Parker, who play dead cops working in the afterlife version of a police station. They have chops worthy of a Howard Hawks screwball comedy, but they're trying to give color and snap to dialogue Hawks wouldn't have been caught dead directing. Advertisement Bridges and Parker are fun to watch. She is a spin on the prim, sassy office brunette from the Progressive Insurance commercials. He is basically undead Rooster Cogburn from \"True Grit\" again, cocking his cowboy hat to the side and working wonders with his eyebrows, facial hair, 19th-century mullet and ill-fitting dentures. There are several extreme close-ups of him in the midst of some ridiculous action number, his ratty grey hair flying, his eyes huge and ablaze with mirth, the way they were when he floated under the skirts of bowling valkyrie in \"The Big Lebowski\". Images of Jeff Bridges enjoying himself are almost enough to make a movie work. \"R.I.P.D.\" does its best to stop him dead in his tracks. The modern special effects comedy is one of the toughest hybrid genres to pull off. Alongside \"Men in Black\", there are a handful of fun ones, such as \"Gremlins\", \"Beetlejuice\", \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\". The pleasantly mediocre ones include \"The Mask\", \"Jumanji\", \"The Addams Family\" (again by Sonnenfeld) and \"Pirates of the Carribean\". At the bottom of the barrel are things like \"Baby Geniuses\" \"Little Man\" and \"Nothing But Trouble\", a Dan Akroyd/Chevy Chase horror-comedy better remembered for its Digital Underground soundtrack hit than its latex mutants and rotting flesh. The closest thing to a masterpiece of the form is \"Kung Fu Hustle\", in which Stephen Chow applied Tex Avery cartoon physics to gangster set pieces the same way Buster Keaton deployed steam locomotives in \"The General\", with a connection to story, character, setup and punchline that leavens and propels rather than pummels and overwhelms. \"R.I.P.D.\" is mostly loud and graceless, despite some arresting hyperbolic visuals that deserve an action film of actual soul and purpose. It's simply too generic at heart to justify director Schwentke's delirious, sidewinding, arcing, snap-zooming and whip-panning anti-gravity camerawork. Time-slice photography lets a virtual camera poke around in otherwise still images of explosions and gun battles; cool, in a Discovery Channel sort of way, but whatever. A scene where Ryan Reynolds\u2014this film's version of Will Smith's \"Men in Black\" character\u2014gets sucked up into the purgatorial police station after being killed in a raid features some of the most seamless cloud effects I've seen since the heyday of Industrial Light & Magic's cloud tank work on \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"Poltergeist\". Later on, a supernatural vortex reminded me of the terrifying storm in Jeff Nichol's \"Take Shelter\". Let's not even go into the \"Nothing But Trouble\"-style CGI evil-undead characters who flounce and slobber through this flick.   How many film titles can I mention in one review? I'm going for the record, anything to avoid thinking about this movie, which mostly punishes thought. It has fits of inspiration\u2014reminders that we're dealing with talented people simply having a bad year, or forced to submit to creative oversight by executives who should only be trusted with the receipts. But it's an awful, awful film. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Assassin's Creed", "Review": "\"Assassin's Creed\" is a movie based on a game franchise where you jump around in period dress (the setting depends on which game you're playing) climb buildings and murder people. Unlike the actual video game, \"Assassin's Creed\" isn't ridiculous and fun, but rather ridiculous and turgid. This is the fundamental disconnect that most video games (except maybe \"Mortal Kombat,\" \"Super Mario Brothers: The Movie\" and \"Street Fighter\") run into: there's no way to translate the hands-on action of a video game to the silver screen, so many video game adaptations either have no plot, or get bogged down in blase set-up.\u00a0 Advertisement Still, why is there so much pensive info-dump talk-talk-talk in \"Assassin's Creed\" about\u00a0the modern-day Knights Templar, and their quest to eradicate global violence using an elaborate virtual reality work program\u2014and yet nothing beyond the basic premise makes sense? Who choreographed these dull, repetitive fight scenes? And why are supporting cast members like Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Rampling skulking listlessly in the corner while poor Michael K. Williams eagerly awaits a good line or two? (He never gets one.) If anybody had a spark of inspiration when they made \"Assassin's Creed,\" it certainly doesn't show. There's a prisoner named Cal Lynch (Michael Fassbender) and he lives in the not-too-distant future. He's sentenced to death and then abducted by a shadowy group (The Templars) that want Cal because of his, uh, DNA. Hang on, let me go back a step: The Templars have a virtual reality machine called the Animus, and it\u00a0sends people back in time so that they can see the world through their ancestors' eyes. This information is useful to the Templars because apparently they need information to find the location of the Apple of Eden, a device (not a fruit) that can be used to eliminate human free will. Also, Cal's ancestor is a member of a counter-revolutionary group called the Assassin's Creed, a group of killers who opposed the Templars' dogmatic quest to dominate the world by hiding the Apple from th ... Long story short: Cal's got information that the Templars need and is apparently too dumb to smell a set-up when he sees it. The same is true of Sofia (Marion Cotillard), Cal's handler, and the daughter of Templar leader Rikkin (Jeremy Irons). Cal's got daddy issues, and this drives him to help the Templars for a spell. Also, apparently the machine gives him the magical ability to learn the martial arts skills that his ancestor Aguilar inherited (this is explained better in the video games, but not much better). Advertisement So: some guy time-travels, learns kung fu, tries to destroy human free will because he's angsty, and then inevitably rebels against the church people who hire him. I say \"some guy\" because nothing really feels important in \"Assassin's Creed\" except everyone's vain attempts at making endless (and fundamentally silly) exposition be taken seriously. So many conversations feel interminable because solemnity takes priority over dynamic storytelling. Characters talk in hushed whispers about\u00a0the hyper-convoluted methods they use to realize their poorly-hidden agendas.\u00a0 And the viewer, in the meantime, constantly stays ahead of the characters because nobody is smart or thoughtful enough to be thinking: \"Hey, maybe I'm being manipulated by a shadowy organization run by people who want to eradicate free will.\" Or, \"Hmmm, maybe I should help a group of people find something as important-sounding as the Apple of Eden.\" These characters don't seem real because all they do is dispense narrative information, and\u00a0move the plot along by inches. Oh, they also occasionally fight, but never in a compelling way. The camera thankfully does not skimp on action in these scenes, but the drab, schematic choreography makes you wish they did. Still, there is one scene where the filmmakers hint at why they wanted to make \"Assassin's Creed\" into a movie: Cal is shown a room where non-compliant Animus test subjects are prematurely aged and/or go blind (this\u00a0is also poorly explained in the movie). Suddenly, the film makes more sense: Is this a \"Zardoz\" homage? \"Zardoz\" is a campy, visionary 1974 science-fiction film where Sean Connery plays a rebellious brute who tries to destroy the Tabernacle, a futuristic repository for all of of humanity's\u00a0culture. The \"Zardoz\" connection is strong in this scene since it features a menagerie full of \"Renegades,\" non-compliant misfits who simply asked too many questions. For a moment, \"Assassin's Creed\" looks like it's about to get interesting. That moment does not last, however, since the filmmakers are more concerned with storytelling mechanics than in the story they're telling. Gamers may enjoy \"Assassin's Creed,\" but everyone else's patience will be tested. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "God Help the Girl", "Review": "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with the long-form, multi-song music video, man.\u201d That\u2019s literally what I was thinking as \u201cGod Help The Girl,\u201d the debut directorial debut from songwriter and musician Stuart Murdoch, stretched past its hour-and-a-half mark. The movie doesn\u2019t quite make it to two hours, but my patience was tried pretty much any point at which the movie went a long stretch without a song.\u00a0 For \u201cGod Help The Girl\u201d is indeed a musical, and a good thing, too. The movie has no deficit of talent in the performing department either. The wide-eyed, beguiling Emily Browning plays Eve, a young, dreamy woman struggling with depression, who, upon release from a hospital after a suicide attempt, makes her way into Glasgow with a song in her heart and little else in the way of direction. She bops her way into the life of young musician James (Olly Alexander, so bookish and near-elfin that Michael Cera could probably break him over his knee); a flirtation leads to a roommate situation; a visit to one of James\u2019 music students, Cass (Hannah Murray) leads to a three-way friendship; the friendship leads to a band. Eve\u2019s self-defeating involvement with a snooty French rocker (Pierre Boulanger) leads to a recurrence of emotional trouble. And so it goes.\u00a0 Advertisement The story, such as it is, gets punctuation and emphasis via musical numbers, some of which seem to take place in the imaginations of the characters, some in the context of band practice or performance and so on. Said musical numbers are pretty tip-top. Murdoch, who also wrote the songs, is the brains behind the Scottish band Belle and Sebastian, whose canny mix of folk and continental pop stylings inspire the frequent use of the word \u201ctwee\u201d among rock critics. I think that\u2019s an unfair call: Belle and Sebastian\u2019s mix of smooth sonics and sardonic wit strikes me as pretty genuine; \u201ctwee\u201d implies a level of affectation that the character of the music just doesn\u2019t support. In any event, Murdoch has said that \u201cGod Help The Girl,\u201d which has its origins as a concept album of sorts, ended up a vehicle for a group of songs that he felt wouldn\u2019t fit into Belle and Sebastian\u2019s repertoire. I see his point, a bit, but by the same token, I have no problem in saying that if you like Belle and Sebastian\u2019s tunes, you\u2019ll like the almost two dozen songs in \u201cGod Help The Girl.\u201d It\u2019s also likely you\u2019ll enjoy the way they\u2019re visualized. Browning gets a lot of nifty retrochic costumes, and the strongest song scenes feel like the picture sleeves of French 45s from the \u201860s come to life. Also beguiling is the perspective on Glasgow; Murdoch shoots it as a largely sunny, sometimes bustling place that occasionally drifts into autumnal quiet. So what\u2019s the problem? The problem is that Murdoch\u2019s script, and his direction of the non-musical bits, is lackluster to the point of somnambulant. Murdoch\u2019s songs show him a writer of fair-to-excellent verbal wit, and his dialogue has more than a few zingers\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve got the constitution of an abandoned rabbit,\u201d good one\u2014but he simply isn\u2019t a dramatist. He can put together homages to \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and \u201cRock And Roll High School\u201d in the space of one song, but he can\u2019t string together really engaging character material when the music\u2019s over. (And his actors try really hard to make up for the deficit.) I really don\u2019t believe in the idea of Critics Telling Artists What To Do, but my idea concerning a long-form music video is not, I believe, an altogether bad one. That is, paradoxical as it might seem, \u201cGod Help The Girl\u201d would have felt more like a real movie\u2014and been more fun, and moving\u2014had the story material been cut to the barest of bones, and that narrative, which is pretty slim to begin with, carried on the backs of the songs. Which, I can\u2019t emphasize enough, really are special. Soundtrack album drops in the U.S. this week, and I can recommend THAT without hesitation."}
{"Stars": 0.5, "Title": "The Cobbler", "Review": "\u201cThe Cobbler\u201d is almost fascinatingly awful enough to\r\nrecommend. If one subscribes to the theory that you can learn as much from a\r\nbad movie as from a good one, this one\u2019s a master class in what not to do. What\r\nstarts off as purely harmless mediocrity piles on the narrative and filmmaking\r\nmistakes to such a degree that it\u2019s like watching a train wreck\u2026that bursts\r\ninto flames\u2026and then another train crashes into it. There\u2019s something\r\nperversely fascinating about a film that doesn\u2019t just go off the rails but does\r\nso in such misguided fashion. And it\u2019s all the more remarkable when you\r\nconsider that \u201cThe Cobbler\u201d was made by an undeniably talented filmmaker, the\r\nman who has given the world great films like \u201cThe Station Agent,\u201d \u201cThe Visitor,\u201d\r\nand \u201cWin Win.\u201d This film is so inferior to those works that it almost disproves\r\nthe auteur theory on its own. Advertisement It starts off innocently enough. Max Simkin (Adam Sandler)\r\nis a quiet, kind cobbler in a New York neighborhood that is being drained of\r\nits personality by big business. He keeps to himself, managing his little shoe\r\nshop, and taking care of his mother since dad disappeared years ago, leaving\r\nhim a story that he still doesn\u2019t really feel is his own. Max is an observer,\r\nsomeone who sees lives going on around him, like the gorgeous model couple\r\noutside his shop, but he doesn\u2019t really have to call his. One night, working on a pair of shoes dropped off by an\r\noutspoken criminal named Ludlow (Method Man), Max\u2019s machine breaks down. He\r\ndigs an old one of his father\u2019s out of the basement and repairs the shoes. He\r\nslips them on, looks in the mirror, and, bam, he\u2019s Ludlow. The transformation\r\nis purely superficial in that Max is exactly the same on the inside but\r\neverything on the outside, including the voice, is of the owner of the shoes.\r\nOf course, Max uses the magical machine on every pair of shoes he can find, spending\r\na bit of time in the shoes of the DJ (Dan Stevens) with the model girlfriend,\r\nand even pretending to be his disappeared dad (Dustin Hoffman) so mom can see him\r\none last time. For half the film, \u201cThe Cobbler\u201d is a well-intentioned but\r\ndull affair\u2014a modern fairy tale about stepping into someone else\u2019s shoes that\r\ndoesn\u2019t do nearly enough with its thematically dense high concept. The piece\r\nhas no thematic resonance at all because writer/director Thomas McCarthy and\r\nco-writer Paul Sado fail to get beyond the superficial. We don\u2019t learn anything\r\nabout the people that Max becomes. In fact, the film is almost defiant in its\r\njudgment of books by their covers. He becomes the genetically blessed Stevens\r\nand a girl hits on him. He becomes his dad and his mom treats him as if he is\r\nher lost partner. \u201cThe Cobbler\u201d suggests that walking a mile in someone else\u2019s\r\nshoes will make you look like that person but not actually experience anything\r\nelse about them.  Advertisement Almost as if McCarthy and Sado can tell the first half isn\u2019t\r\nreally working, they blow up their concept into a quasi-superhero movie in the\r\nsecond half, as Max juggles shoes/characters in an attempt to stop a nefarious\r\nbusinesswoman (Ellen Barkin) who is trying to push locally-owned businesses out\r\nof the neighborhood. In a remarkably episodic film, this is where it jumps the\r\nshark in jaw-dropping fashion, a screenwriting mess that\u2019s also poorly executed filmically.\r\nThe lack of tonal consistency led to production values that have no personality\r\nat all. Scenes are shot from flat, predictable angles, often from one side of\r\nthe room, as if we\u2019re looking at a bad theatre stage, on which boring sets have\r\nbeen designed. The film becomes remarkably lifeless, almost as if it\u2019s falling\r\nasleep with its audience, until a final act twist seals the deal in terms of\r\nbad, manipulative screenwriting. The last few minutes are jaw-dropping\u2014like a\r\nsour cherry on a bad movie sundae. What\u2019s so bizarre about \u201cThe Cobbler\u201d is that it was\r\ndirected by a man who, up to this point, had never helmed even a mediocre film,\r\nmuch less a disaster. If this was just another Happy Madison joint, it might\r\nmake more sense, but Thomas McCarthy has proven himself deft at presenting us\r\ncomplex characters in films like \u201cThe Visitor\u201d and \u201cWin Win.\u201d By the end of\r\nthose pieces, we really felt like we had\r\nwalked a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes, and were richer for the experience. Only masochists are made richer by \"The Cobbler\"."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Mayhem", "Review": "Joe Lynch\u2019s \u201cMayhem\u201d feels like a timely film in a way it wouldn\u2019t have a couple years ago. Whatever your political party may be, anger has been a palpable emotion in this country recently\u2014it was anger that got Trump elected, and it\u2019s anger that opposes his administration. But what do we do with that anger? How long can we keep it down before it overwhelms us? With his best film since \u201cWrong Turn 2,\u201d Lynch channels that national anger into a stylish, smart, propulsive gore-fest set in a corporate America that takes no prisoners. But when did it? Advertisement Not only is \u201cMayhem\u201d a brutal, visceral gut punch at a time of the year when we typically drown in awards bait, but it feels like a movie designed to tap into a vein of frustration and anger at a corrupt system. Hate your boss? Can\u2019t control your road rage? Want to push your co-workers down a stairwell? Thinking mean things about the President and his cronies? \u201cMayhem\u201d channels rage at an unfair society and the bullshit that trickles down from the Powers That Be into a paean to uncontrolled anger. Much more tonally consistent than the similar \u201cThe Belko Experiment,\u201d \u201cMayhem\u201d isn\u2019t as much about id run rampant as it is two people finally loosed from moral and societal constraints in a way that allows them to enact bloody, vicious vengeance. There are times when the whole thing feels like an extended version of that scene from \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service,\u201d or, worse, the movie that would be the\u00a0favorite film of the lunatic followers of Tyler Durden in \u201cFight Club,\u201d but this weird little genre exercise works way more often than it doesn\u2019t, and actually has something to say in the process.    The premise of \u201cMayhem\u201d is simple in a way that I think a lot of horror masters would admire. There\u2019s an airborne disease, referred to as \u201cRed Eye\u201d for the single red-eye it gives those who suffer from it, that removes all societal and moral governance. So those infected with it don\u2019t just get mad, they get bloody. And it happens to infect a firm (and not just any firm\u00a0but the one that set the legal precedent for \"Red-Eye Defense\" by recently getting off a murderer who was infected with it at the time)\u00a0filled with the kind of well-tailored monsters who barely control their impulse for cruelty anyway. These are the kind of people who gleefully step on the little man in the pursuit of the almighty dollar, and one of the most interesting aspects of \u201cMayhem\u201d is the choice Lynch makes not to infect \u201caverage Joes\u201d but people who seem to have practice unleashing their inner monsters. When John Towers (Steven Brand), the boss of this loathsome company, says to someone beneath him that \u201cYou must protect those above you,\u201d it\u2019s the kind of human shield mentality that CEOs and executives have been using for scapegoats for decades.    However, the protection in this case is literal, and the man that Towers needs it from is Derek Cho (Steven Yeun, going from fighting zombies on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d to maniacal suits here), a rising star who is about to be fired on the day the infection hits the company. Rather than take his corporate execution the way so many do, he picks up a hammer and a nail gun and goes after the people above him, assisted by a client named Melanie Cross (Samara Weaving), who was in the office that day fighting an immoral foreclosure. Caroline Chikezie, Kerry Fox, and Dallas Roberts co-star as corporate monsters at Derek\u2019s company, but the movie belongs to Yeun and Weaving, who both get exactly what Lynch is going for here. They are fearless and intense in ways that other performers would have missed. Yeun proves himself to be a more engaging leading man than I would have expected and Weaving has the energy of Margot Robbie\u2014captivating and a little scary at the same time. They're both really good, and it's their commitment that keeps \"Mayhem\" humming. Advertisement \u201cMayhem\u201d is at its best when it channels relatable stress into utter genre insanity. It\u2019s like \u201cOffice Space\u201d if Michael Bolton went on a murderous spree with a nail gun, playing on workplace stress instead of pure id, and it has a violent momentum that\u2019s hard to deny, well-directed by Lynch (who might use a few too many quick cuts but also stages a brutal scene to Faith No More, so all is forgiven). It can be such a relentless experience that it surely won\u2019t be for everyone, but it works best when considered as a film that\u2019s essentially about people willing to kill, bribe and offer power to anyone to not only save their own skins but also excuse their own horrors. Whether you would levy such accusations at Trump or the candidate he beat a year ago, there's something about watching a movie about unleashing repressed anger at injustice\u00a0a year after Election Day 2016 that just feels right."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Harmonium", "Review": "You have to get used to the creeping pace of slow-boil Japanese revenge drama \"Harmonium\" in order to get on its wavelength. The film follows characters who are, if you distill them to their psychological profiles, not that different from the kinds of people you'd encounter in an Alfred Hitchcock movie or a Patricia Highsmith novel. Polite stranger Yasaka (Tadanobu Asano) disturbs the peace of emotionally unavailable patriarch Toshio (Kanji Furutachi) and flustered but curious wife Akie (Mariko Tsutsui). While there are a handful of moments after the sixty-minute mark that rely on plot twists, tonal shifts, and character-driven plotting, \"Harmonium\" is consistently about mood more than anything else. You sink into the film at first. Then, with each new leisurely introduced plot point, you struggle to regain your sense of calm since, after a while, the film's protagonists are doing the exact same thing. Advertisement \"Harmonium,\" the latest film written and directed by Koji Fukada (\"Hospitalite,\" \"Sayonara\"), largely moves at the speed of everyday routine. Characters go about their daily tasks. Akie oversees daughter Hotaru (Momone Shinokawa) as she practices on her\u00a0harmonium. Toshio toils in his garage workshop. And Hotaru skips home from a nearby playground. Yasaka, an ex-convict and old acquaintance of Toshio's, is the only main character who has no set routine. His presence throws everybody off, but they eventually get used to him. They talk to him in a matter-of-fact tone for fear that something violent and abrupt will happen if they otherwise treat him like a threat. If they acknowledge that Yatsuka is a threat by changing their habits, then something bad will surely happen. Maybe he'll go away. Maybe he's as tranquil and non-threatening as he seems. Maybe he's not the boogeyman. That uncertainty\u00a0is the crux of \"Harmonium\": will Yasaka forgive Toshio of whatever crime or wrong-doing he's committed in the past? Or will Asano's character lash out at Toshio in all the ways we've come to expect from other revenge thrillers: ruin his business, hurt his daughter, and sleep with his wife? Without giving anything away, I will say that \"Harmonium\" does inevitably go places that you\u00a0expect it to. And it does not always get there in the most subtle ways. In a key\u2014and immediately jarring scene\u2014Yasaka breaks from his established character, and flat-out says that he wants everything Toshio has. Then Yasaka suddenly regains control of his emotions, and re-assures Toshio that he was only joking. You can't help but groan at this scene. It's like slamming on the brakes during a leisurely drive just so you can point at a giant billboard. We can't miss it,\u00a0why did you stop? But after a while, it becomes clear that \"Harmonium\" is, like the best revenge dramas, a movie about the failure of individual characters to regain their composure after tragic events. The second half of the film feels like a separate, but related narrative: everybody recovers after the events of the first hour by inviting a second stranger,\u00a0Takashi (Taiga)\u00a0into their midst. But both halves of the film are related in that the first part establishes a certain flow, and the second part shows our characters' vain attempts at regaining that flow. In this way, the second half reminds us of how tentative, or\u00a0even illusory the first half's mood was. Maybe these characters were never at peace. Maybe there was never a time when they walked on eggshells around each other. Advertisement Your response to Fukada's latest depends, in that sense, on your ability and desire to get used to its lack of normal rhythm. \"Harmonium\" is slow, and deceptively tranquil for the most part. Occasionally, there are moments that jar you out of your complacency, and remind you of what's emotionally at stake. The movie functions on an emotional level rather than an intellectual one. If you don't get on its wavelength, you'll feel like you've wasted your time on a movie that is a bit like a slowed-down thriller whose impact has been lessened by the existence of superior novels and films, like \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" or \"Shadow of a Doubt.\" But if you treat \"Harmonium\" like a mood piece, and you do respond to it on that level, you'll find yourself thinking about it long after you watch it."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "John Dies at the End", "Review": "The threat of apocalypse no longer holds consequence enough; for director Don Coscarelli's latest gonzo genre blend, \"John Dies at the End,\" fabricated realities sit worse with its cast of misfits, slackers, and interstellar beings than the so-called \"End of the World as We Know It.\"\u00a0 In this adaptation of author Jason Pargin's novel, the comic horror extends in many directions, but addiction is chief among them. Soy Sauce, a dimension-bending designer drug, ensnares slacker friends David Wong (Chase Williamson) and John (Rob Mayes). One dose produces an onslaught of nightmarish effects, beginning with hyper-acute psychic abilities, and ending with summoned hellspawn from portals tucked in the shadows. Rationality? Never heard of it. Advertisement Desperate journalist Arnie Blondestone (Paul Giamatti) attempts to find some nonetheless, but as present-day David recounts his surreal exploits in a dingy Chinese restaurant, the quest for truth instead leads down a rabbit hole of lunacy and delusion. This is highlighted by the film's title: more theory than spoiler, it assumes a winking, self-aware attitude toward narrative and genre that beckons you to question your expectations of either. And for the first half, it very nearly succeeds. As director Coscarelli demonstrated in \"Phantasm\" and \"Bubba Ho-Tep,\" he likes to traffic in scrappy chaos, spicing every dollop of gore with an equivalent dose of laughter. This is nowhere more apparent than in the film's opening sequence, a whirling philosophical riff by David on whether a zombie-skewering axe \u2014 thrice repaired \u2014 can still be considered the same weapon. At its finest, \"John\" glides on this charming fusion of ideas and goofy fun; there are recurring nods to the duplicitous nature of everyday perception \u2014 a well-tread avenue in sci-fi, but rarely done with such a vibrant sense of empathy and low-budget charm. How does one react when told they're simply the hallucinations of someone else? As Coscarelli shows, first with a chuckle, and then a creeping realization of horror.\u00a0 But such epiphanies are mere glimmers in the galaxies of incident that the film presents. Glynn Turman and Doug Jones appear as mysterious figures on the fringe, joining Giamatti (who's clearly having a ball) to filtering exposition through terse monologues. A talking dog serves the same function, but not before a self-help psychic (Clancy Brown) and the orgy from \"Eyes Wide Shut\" show up as well.\u00a0 Along with Jones, Turman, and Giamatti, the two leads try their best to rein in the narrative. Relatable yet maintaining an unsteady smirk throughout, Williamson and Mayes are two fresh faces who snugly fit the traditional (and watchable) buddy dynamic. Mayes especially delights, embodying that peculiar quality in your most untrustworthy friend: unreliable for a ride, but essential if the world should ever face annihilation. When events finally do escalate into urgency, however, Coscarelli pulls back and opts for greater eccentricities and tangential oddities. He's attempting something of grand ambition and scope \u2014 sharing the same twitchy vision Richard Kelly displayed in \"Southland Tales\" \u2014 but sacrificing coherence in the process. Advertisement As David and John jump dimensions one wisecrack at a time, the narrative disintegrates. Crammed full of asides that reach unresolved plateaus, our main story \u2014 David's fight against predetermination and identity \u2014 fails to establish any lingering stakes. So, when apparently vital twists occur then later on, any interest vanishes, as significance or gravity are pulverized into pop-culture vapors.\u00a0 To date, I've remained unexposed to Pargis and his work under the fitting pseudonym David Wong, but what Coscarelli's achieved doesn't feel like an adaptation. It feels more like he seems he skimmed the source material, burned it, and then assembled a vague recollection on film after three days of untold indulgences. It would be quite a shock to hear that the film is entirely faithful to Wong's original story. A cult following seems to be the audience \"John\" desires, but more often than not, those pre-programmed genre entries wind up in the nether regions of Netflix. I hope Coscarelli's strange concoction escapes that fate, though. He knows how to exploit horror/sci-fi tropes and adeptly meld a practical effect with a well-timed gag.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "North Sea Texas", "Review": "\"North Sea Texas\" is a toothless coming-of-age story set in a small Belgian town sometime around 1970. The movie is pleasant to look at; the props and sets, painted in hazy primary colors, seem as though they were carved out of glycerin soap. But while the movie is often pretty, it's only intermittently compelling. Lacking much depth or spark, \"North Sea Texas\" feels like a short film stretched to feature length; its flaws \u2014 inertness, tissue-thin characterizations \u2014 are the sorts of things that can pass by unnoticed in a fifteen-minute movie, but get a little boring after an hour. Advertisement It's no surprise, then, that writer-director Bavo Defurne is a veteran of the short film circuit; though \"North Sea Texas\" is his first feature, Defurne has in fact been making movies for more than two decades. Some of these movies have been quite good. \"Campfire\" (2000), for instance, centers on two teenage boys who develop a mutual attraction while out on a camping trip with their scout troop. It's sensitive, intelligent, and just 21 minutes long. Though \"North Sea Texas\" is adapted from a young adult novel, it in many ways feels like a remake of \"Campfire.\" Like the earlier film, it tells the story of a mutual attraction between two teenage boys \u2014 15-year old Pim (Jelle Florizoone) and his 18-year old best friend, Gino (Mathias Vergels). As in \"Campfire,\" one of the boys \u2014 in this case Gino \u2014 has a girlfriend. Both films also make symbolic use of tents \u2014 as innocent, intimate meeting places \u2014 and bodies of water (a lake in \"Campfire,\" the North Sea in \"North Sea Texas\"). So why is it that \"Campfire\" is engrossing, while \"North Sea Texas\" is frequently dull? The problem comes down to underdevelopment. \"North Sea Texas\" has many characters: Gino's sister, who has a crush on Pim; Pim's irresponsible, accordion-playing mother, Yvette; the sleazy man who drives Yvette to her accordion gigs; a tattooed Bulgarian carnival worker who rooms in Pim's house; Gino's saintly, sickly mother. Not one of these, however, is developed past a basic thumbnail sketch \u2014 not even Pim, who is ostensibly the center of the movie.  We know that Pim is gay and shy and that he likes to draw \u2014 and that's about it. We know that Gino enjoys Pim's attention but is uncomfortable with his attraction to the younger boy, and that he likes motorcycles. Beyond that, there really isn't anything to either character. As a result, their attraction registers more as an idea than as a relationship. The movie isn't a complete snooze, though. Every now and then, Defurne pulls together a sequence that brings across the sort of longing and sexual confusion that his characters are supposed to be experiencing. One such scene comes at around the film's midpoint \u2014 an awkward dance shared by Pim and Gino's sister to the sound of April Stevens' risqu\u00e9 1959 single, \"Teach Me Tiger.\"  Advertisement The sight of these two teenagers slow-dancing at arm's length makes for a neat, potent image of adolescent sexuality \u2014 something halfway between innocence and desire. There's also an evocative early sequence where Pim and Gino take a trip into the woods for a tryst; upon arriving, the two are framed \u2014 or perhaps protected \u2014 by a foreground of leafy branches. The scene climaxes (no pun intended) with several shots of swaying grass. The sense that Pim and Gino's attraction is something of a benevolent natural force is palpable \u2014 and, for a moment, intoxicating. The problem, though, is that these quasi-poetic reveries \u2014 the stuff Defurne's short films were made of \u2014 are few and far between in \"North Sea Texas.\" In lieu of poetry, what the movie presents is a lot of muted melodrama. Shots of characters sullenly sitting at kitchen tables abound. Suggestive threads \u2014 such as the way in which Pim and his mother compete for the Bulgarian boarder's attention \u2014 are introduced and then left to fizzle out. It's not just that film is underdeveloped \u2014 it's that it feels unwilling to develop, preferring to leave its characters and plot points static. The result feels stunted."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "The Wrestler", "Review": "\"The Wrestler\" is about a man who can do one thing well, and keeps on doing it because of need, weary skill and pride. He wrestles for a living. Pro wrestling is a fake sport, right? Yes, but as an activity, it's pretty real. I watch it on TV with fascination. It's scripted that the villain sneaks up on the hero, who pretends not to see him, and pushes him over the ropes and out of the ring. Fake. But when the hero hits the floor, how fake is that? \"Those guys learn how to fall,\" people tell me. Want to sign up for the lessons? Advertisement Mickey Rourke plays the battered, broke, lonely hero, Randy (\"The Ram\") Robinson. This is the performance of his lifetime, will win him a nomination, may win him the Oscar. Like many great performances, it has an element of truth. Rourke himself was once young and glorious and made the big bucks. He did professional boxing just for the hell of it. He alienated a lot of people. He fell from grace and stardom, but kept working, because he was an actor and that was what he did. Now here is his comeback role, playing Randy the Ram's comeback. This is Rourke doing astonishing physical acting. He has the physique of a body builder, perhaps thanks to some steroid use, which would also be true of Randy. He gets into the ring and does the work. Rourke may not be physically performing every single thing we see, including the leaps off ropes and ladders and the nasty falls. Special effects have robbed movies of their believability. But I've seen a lot of F/X, and I have to say it looked to me like he was really doing these things. Not that it matters. It appears that he is, and his ring performances and the punishment he takes supply the bedrock for the story, which involves his damaged relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and what he hopes will become a relationship with the stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei). Except for his backstage camaraderie with other wrestling old-timers, Randy has burned all his bridges in life. Stephanie is far, far from happy to see him at her door again. And he doesn't quite believe Cassidy, whose real name is Pam, when she carefully explains that she is not available. Here is the irony, which he won't accept. Cassidy is as much a performer as Randy. He is a ring worker. She is a sex worker. They put on a show and give the customers what they want. It pays the rent. There is always a chasm between pros and their audiences. That's why so many show-biz people marry each other. Magicians say, \"The trick is told when the trick is sold.\" Think about that. But Randy has grown a little wiser with the years, less blinded by stardom, more able to admit emotional need. Maybe, too, he was using more drugs in those days, and they always take first place before relationships. (He gets a sales pitch from a fellow wrestler who seems to stock more drugs than Walgreens.) Randy has a residual charm and sentimentality, which helps him and also deceives him. He makes some small progress with his daughter.  Advertisement And as for Cassidy -- have you ever seen Marisa Tomei play a bitch? I haven't. I don't know if she can. She seems to have something good at the heart of her that endows this stripper with warmth and sympathy. Not that Randy should get his hopes up. The most fascinating element in Darren Aronofsky's film is the backstage detail about wrestling. He does this so well, yet has never made a film even remotely like this before. In the snow and slush of New Jersey, Randy and his opponents make the rounds of shabby union halls, school gyms, community centers and American Legion halls, using whatever they can find for dressing rooms, taping their damaged parts, psyching themselves up and agreeing beforehand on the script. We learn how they make themselves bleed, prepare for violent \"surprises,\" talk through each match. And then they go out and do it. As nearly as I can tell, their planning only means that they get hurt in the ways they expect, and not in unforeseen ways. I cared as deeply about Randy the Ram as any movie character I've seen this year. I cared about Mickey Rourke, too. The way this role and this film unfold, that almost amounts to the same thing. Rourke may not win the Oscar for best actor. But it would make me feel good to see him up there. It really would. Note: \"The Wrestler\" is one of the year's best films. It wasn't on my \"best films\" list for complicated and boring reasons."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Gett, the Trial of Viviane Amsalem", "Review": "With \"Gett, the Trial of Viviane Amsalem,\" siblings Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz prove that they rank with the finest filmmakers alive.\u00a0 Every shot, cut, line, performance, indeed every moment in this feature is perfectly judged, always conveying precisely what it needs to convey in order to define its characters and move the story forward. And yet the result never seems merely neat or efficient. Even though \"Gett\" tells of 45-year-old Israeli woman seeking a divorce from her domineering husband, and makes unsettling points about what it means to be a woman in a religiously conservative country (or a woman in any society), the film is less an object lesson, lecture, or problem picture than a comedy-drama about the complexity of people and the elusiveness of truth. Advertisement Most of the film takes place in a small courtroom, with the plaintiff, Viviane (co-director Ronit Elkabetz, who's also an accomplished actress), suing her husband Elisha (Simon Abkarian of \"Zero Dark Thirty\") for divorce. For women, divorce is much harder to obtain in Israel than in other Westernized countries. In fact, the husband holds most of the cards and rarely has to lay any of them down. The male-dominated, religiously orthodox panel of judges overseeing the case (led by Rabbi Solomon, played by Mandy Patinkin-lookalike Eli Gornstein) insists on a high standard of proof from Viviane\u2014so high, in fact, that what should be a simple matter of filling out forms becomes an ordeal that would tax the patience of Job.\u00a0 As depicted here, an Israeli woman can't split from her spouse without proving extraordinary abuse or neglect. A simple assertion of \"We don't get along\" or \"This marriage was a mistake\" is not enough. All the husband has do to preserve the status quo is avoid taking action\u2014and that's what Elisha, a magnetic yet tactically aloof man, does in the first part of \"Gett,\" asking for delays, failing to show up in court, and otherwise stonewalling and dragging things out in an attempt to wear Viviane down. He doesn't want to grant her wish. We wonder why. There seems to be little love left between them. Is his intransigence a matter of male pride: the fear of losing face? Or does he truly love her, so much that he'd rather be miserable with her than let her go?\u00a0 The movie keeps us guessing, and even as it tightens the emotional screws, it never stops being enjoyable. That's because the filmmakers treat the courtroom as a golden opportunity for people-watching. Both the judges' elevated bench and the small tables at which the plaintiffs and defendants sit or stand feel like halves of a stage. Viviane and Elisha mostly seethe in silence, listening as their lawyers spar. The barristers are very different but seem evenly matched: pragmatic, skeptical Carmel (Menashe Noy) stumps for the plaintiff; the defendant is represented by his wily and talkative brother Shimon (Sasson Gabai), whose folksy demeanor becomes at once more endearing and more unsettling once you figure out that it's his most potent weapon. \u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement Center stage is a smaller, podium-like table where character witnesses for Viviane and Elisha come to testify. When we get accustomed to the movie's distinctive rhythms, we lean forward in our seats a little bit whenever a new face appears, because we know the character is going to be different from, but as fascinating as, whoever stood there last.\u00a0 Part of the fun lies in watching these witnesses come in with a rehearsed, polished story, only to relinquish it once judges and opposing counsel start poking holes in their facades. The cream of the crop includes Viviane's sister-in-law Rachel, a volcanically spirited woman whose testimony becomes a comic tirade against the inequities of male-female relations and the sham of marriage-as-partnership. There are also great, wise bits of observational humor involving the witnesses' inability or refusal to take direction from the judges.\u00a0 The inertia at the heart of Viviane's plight makes watching \"Gett\" an unexpectedly tense and claustrophobic experience. For a film in which the characters do a lot of talking but not much moving around, and that unfolds in a handful of mostly small and plain locations, it's as relentless as an action-adventure picture. This is partly because the stakes are so basic and clear (Viviane is miserable and depressed, and wants to be free and happy) but also because the filmmakers have chosen to tell the story in a highly, ahem, unorthodox way: by adopting the perspectives of different characters from one moment to the next; positioning their shots so subjectively, and with such geographical precision, that we feel as though we've been dropped into a new consciousness, and allowed to see through fresh eyes. We might wonder why we're seeing a character in profile for several long seconds, or from a very low angle, or partly hidden behind another character's shoulder, and then a cut will establish who's doing the looking, and all at once we find ourselves thinking about what the information at that particular moment means to the person who's seeing and hearing it as it's being delivered. The film's stylistic boldness might not have been necessary: the script is so tight and and propulsive and the large cast so skilled that the moviemakers could have just pointed the camera at the characters and probably created a reasonably thoughtful and engaging drama. But the direction is a masterstroke because it adds a literary or even poetic dimension to the movie, finding a visual analogue to the idea that the truth varies depending on who you are and where you stand.\u00a0 The filmmakers' previous work, \"To Take a Wife\" and \"7 Days,\" were superb as well, but this one is a step up in ambition and exactness. Every touch enriches or builds out the story, and yet \"Gett\" never loses focus on the heroine's plight. We're always with her, and often the throwaway touches are more devastating than the larger setbacks, as when a judge asks her if she wants water, and she politely declines, and a bailiff leaves the room anyway. You just know he's going to return with a glass of water anyway, and sure enough, he does. Rarely has such a simple gesture so clearly communicated what it means to be the heroine in a narrative you cannot control. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Strangerland", "Review": "\u201cStrangerland\u201d marks Nicole Kidman\u2019s first starring role in an independent Australian film since 1989\u2019s \u201cDead Calm,\u201d the movie that put her on the map. Over the many years since Philip Noyce\u2019s claustrophobic thriller on the high seas, Kidman consistently has surprised us and taken chances in a variety of parts. She has\u00a0dared to visit dark and disturbing places to explore the complicated psychologies of her characters. This is certainly true, as well, in \u201cStrangerland,\u201d in which she plays a wife and mother devastated by the disappearance of her two children from a middle-of-nowhere desert town. If only her performance were in the service of a better film. Director Kim Farrant\u2019s debut feature is beautifully shot and offers some powerful, well-acted moments from a strong cast, but it\u2019s just relentlessly dreary. Advertisement Despite some striking, widescreen imagery from Irish cinematographer PJ Dillon\u2014including shimmering sunsets, craggy canyons and a doozy of a dust storm\u2014\u201cStrangerland\u201d is, more often than not, lifeless and languid. It\u2019s a missing-kid mystery with some red herrings and misplaced mysticism, all of which leads to an ending that\u2019s coy in its intentional ambiguity and ultimately unsatisfying. There\u2019s tension at the start, though, with the help of some effectively minimalist sound design: the thrum of a ceiling fan, the scratch of a pencil on a crossword puzzle, a fly buzzing overhead in the kitchen. Working from a script by\u00a0Fiona Seres and Michael Kinirons, Farrant creates a vivid sense of loneliness and isolation. You actually might think you\u2019ve walked into a zombie movie by mistake; its opening sequence features a pre-teen boy wandering by himself through the silent streets and desolate remnants of civilization in a small, dusty town. This is fictional Nathgari, where the Parker family reluctantly moved recently. Father Matthew (Joseph Fiennes) is a pharmacist who\u2019s away at work most of the day. That leaves Kidman\u2019s Catherine to care for their two children: angsty, adolescent Tommy (Nicholas Hamilton) and his 15-year-old sister, the sultry Lily (Maddison Brown). There are allusions to a scandal involving this young woman, which forced the family to relocate, but her barely-there clothing and provocative demeanor provide early clues. It\u2019s hot, and they\u2019re bored, so they do what kids do all over the world when they\u2019re hot and bored: spend their days at the town\u2019s makeshift skate park. It\u2019s a bleak place dotted with worn-out furniture, trashed shipping containers and disenfranchised youth, including a vaguely hunky dude named Steve (Sean Keenan) with an ominous serpent tattoo. One night, out of nowhere, Tommy and Lily get out of their beds, leave the house and wander into the vast unknown. The police detective assigned to the case, Rae (Hugo Weaving), turns to Steve as an early suspect. But there\u2019s also Burtie (Meyne Wyatt), a slow-minded but good-hearted Aboriginal man who\u2019s been helping out around the Parkers\u2019 house. And there is a dust storm: a meteorological act of mythical proportions that covers everything and everyone in a thick, orange haze, physically and psychologically. Any or all of these may have been factors in the kids\u2019 ongoing disappearance. Or not. Lily\u2019s diary, which Catherine finds hidden in her bedroom, further confuses matters\u2014as does Lily\u2019s wispy poetry, which we hear in breathy voiceover. Advertisement Farrant aims to explore several dynamics and themes at once here: loss of innocence, indigenous mythology, societal judgment and a marriage in peril. (Matthew and Catherine\u2019s bond already was a tenuous one\u2014they routinely sleep in separate bedrooms\u2014but it rips apart once the children are gone.) Despite the film\u2019s prevailing quiet and understatement, though, \u201cStrangerland\u201d tries to encompass too much, which makes it feel scattered and unfocused. A monotonous feeling of blame and guilt is constant, however. Kidman has several strong moments with Weaving, who gives a commanding yet sympathetic performance as a man who\u2019s suffered losses of his own. Her scenes with Fiennes never have that kind of spark, though, mainly because his primary character trait is stoicism, punctuated by a couple of impetuous acts of bloody violence. But her steady collapse provides the film\u2019s spine and is the main element that keeps the film watchable, even as it wanders into uncomfortable territory and drags to its conclusion. That a mother would become increasingly bereft over the disappearance of her children is more than understandable, but in Kidman\u2019s hands, this woman lays herself bare in more ways than one. It\u2019s unsettling, but she can only do so much."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Beatriz at Dinner", "Review": "Since the early \u201890s, Salma Hayek has carved quite a niche for herself as an actress with a serial array of singular spitfires. She\u2019s been a gunslinger\u2019s sultry squeeze in \u201cDesperado,\u201d a blood-sucking stripper in \u201cFrom Dusk to Dawn,\u201d a fierce one-of-a-kind painter in \u201cFrida\u201d and the voice of slinky Kitty Softpaws in \u201cPuss in Boots.\u201d Hayek on screen can be a formidable heat-radiating presence when given the right material (aka not an Adam Sandler comedy), and knows precisely when and how to turn it on.\u00a0 Advertisement But in \u201cBeatriz at Dinner,\u201d Hayek turns down the thermostat and assumes a cool, calm and, yes, beatific demeanor as an L.A.-based Mexican-born masseuse with magic fingers and holistic healing abilities whose connection to her ailing clients at a touchy-feely cancer clinic is almost empath-like. She is also at one with the universe, as signified by the dogs and bleating goat (the better to protect it from an angry neighbor) that crowd her bedroom at night or the image of the Virgin Mary and a toy Buddha that decorate her car. With a fringe of baby bangs, minimal makeup and a functional wardrobe, Beatriz obviously values the spiritual over the material. The serene sight of a de-glammed Hayek, beautiful and miraculously youthful at age 50, is a compelling one indeed.\u00a0 Her Beatriz seems uniquely weaponized to pull off a one-woman rebellion against a walking, talking emblem of the toxic political climate that continues to pollute our world in what is essentially one of the first blatantly intentional culture-clash allegories for our Trump-ian times. As directed by Miguel Arteta and written by Mike White, whose previous envelope-pushing partnerships include \u201cChuck & Buck,\u201d \u201cThe Good Girl\u201d and TV\u2019s \u201cEnlightened,\u201d the pair provides the circumstances for a dinner party from hell at a generically showy Newport Beach seaside mansion, the sort of a place where champagne popsicles on solemn holidays of remembrance would feel right at home. The story fully kicks in when Beatriz, who makes house calls, ends up getting stuck in a wealthy client\u2019s circular driveway when her clunky Volkswagen breaks down. Cathy (welcome-sight Connie Britton, resurrected from her country superstar\u2019s demise on TV\u2019s \u201cNashville\u201d as the only other sympathetic character) considers Beatriz one of the family after she did wonders for her now-cured college-age daughter during chemotherapy. She naturally asks Beatriz, who has to wait for a mechanic friend to show up, to join the fancy gathering she is hosting that night. Advertisement Trouble is, it is a crucial business function for her brusque husband (David Warshofsky), one that includes his boss\u2014real-estate tycoon Douglas Strutt (John Lithgow, who manages to ooze menace, condescension and charisma in equal measure as an obvious though more socially adept Trump surrogate)\u2014and junior associate Alex (Jay Duplass, in full-on entitled jerk mode), along with their shallow couture-bedecked spouses (Amy Landecker as Strutt\u2019s third wife and Chloe Sevigny).\u00a0 You might be thinking you don\u2019t want to witness a darkly humorous yet disturbing re-enactment of what we see and hear on cable news every hour. And it\u2019s true that White\u2019s script often creeps a little too close to being what it intends to satirize. But Lithgow\u2019s smartly modulated performance as Strutt (got to love that name) is the key here, since the actor allows us to observe just how such a vile, egotistical-yet-ingratiating captain of industry could easily manipulate others to do his bidding while justifying the often-deadly sins against humanity and the planet in general. Combustion between the smirk-prone privileged few and the selfless if somewhat na\u00efve health-care worker is inevitable, but the filmmakers wisely allow it to simmer, with the assist of way too much alcohol. Eventually Beatriz\u2014not used to drinking wine\u2014finds she can no longer remain silent and begins to overshare her own history. That causes the rich folk to gradually expose the cesspool depths of their corrupt lifestyles while celebrating their financial gains at the expense of other living beings. When Strutt boastfully shares a photo of bloody rhino he shot on an African safari, matters reach a breaking point as Beatriz exclaims, \u201cAre you for real? This is disgusting.\u201d\u00a0 Arteta and White are aware enough to tap into the discomfort of those who are appalled by our country\u2019s sudden turn of events and the self-satisfaction of others who find themselves with greater license to exploit their worst impulses than ever before. After the loud confrontation, an already tipsy Beatriz retreats into her room for the night with a bottle of wine and a joint she has found in a dresser while the others launch fire-powered paper lanterns into the sky as they make wishes. And the filmmakers then engage in a more violent form of wish-fulfillment before leaving us dangling with a more open-ended closing sequence\u2014which seems about right when we don\u2019t know which way the tweet wind will blow day after day. Yes, this type of dinner party scenario could have benefited from a bit more nuance on the menu as the filmmakers are too on the nose as they ape the national debate, the shift in priorities and general unease that has consumed the citizenry since the presidential election. But Hayek turns Beatriz into her own breed of wonder woman, Lithgow\u2019s Strutt is definitely a super villain of sorts and their head-to-head battle is clearly worth seeing even if, in real life, it has only begun.

Although competently made, the film is such\r\na run-of-the-mill military melodrama that it might have skipped its assuredly\r\nbrief theatrical appearance and gone straight to VOD. The seemingly interminable conflict in Afghanistan having\r\nbecome America\u2019s longest war, it\u2019s hardly surprising that it (like the\r\nnow-reviving Iraq War) has produced a spate of dramatic movies about its human\r\ncosts for American soldiers. These generally break down into those that observe\r\nthe action \u201cin country\u201d and others which chronicle the after-effects on\r\nreturning soldiers. \u201cFort Bliss\u201d starts out looking like the first type of\r\nmovie but soon transforms into the second.  Advertisement The tale opens in the heat of battle as a U.S. convoy is\r\nattacked while on a night mission and all hell breaks loose. In a chillingly\r\ngruesome scene, Army medic Maggie Swann (Monaghan) faces the task of extracting\r\na large piece of ordnance from a badly wounded but still conscious soldier. Her\r\ncool expertise at performing this torturous action shows that she\u2019s a\r\nbattle-hardened pro. Fortunately for her, it\u2019s her last day in Afghanistan. But\r\nnext up, she\u2019ll test the maxim that it\u2019s harder going home than going to war. Back in the U.S. at the eponymous fort, Maggie first has to\r\ndeal with the extreme disaffection of her five-year-old son, Paul (Oakes\r\nFegley), who during her latest tour of duty has been living with her ex-husband\r\nRichard (Ron Livingston) and his current wife. When Maggie comes to pick him\r\nup, the boy looks at her as if she\u2019s a stranger and screams his head off as she\r\ntakes away with her. While the strength of this antagonism stretches credulity\r\nsomewhat (wouldn\u2019t such distant parents be in constant touch with their kids by\r\nSkype?), the scenes between mother and son, which gradually grow warmer and\r\nmore affectionate, convey the difficulties that long separations cause\r\nfamilies. But family isn\u2019t Maggie\u2019s only challenge. Still on active\r\nduty, she\u2019s charged with training a unit of medics who will eventually be sent\r\nto Afghanistan. It\u2019s supposed to a temporary assignment, but then the group\u2019s\r\nschedule is sped up, and she\u2019s told she will go back to war with them.\r\nFearing that her slowly recovering relationship with her son would be dealt a\r\nmortal blow by another long separation, she comes up with a plan to get herself\r\nassigned to a two-year tour of duty in South Korea, where Paul could accompany\r\nher. But Richard is enraged at the thought of not seeing his son for two years and\r\nthreatens to sue for custody. And there\u2019s another complication: Maggie\r\ngradually comes to see that the officer who would replace her in training the\r\nmedics for Afghanistan (excellent Gbenga Akinnadbe) is a ticking time bomb\r\nwhose unstable mental health could endanger her charges. Advertisement As if all this weren\u2019t enough, Maggie has emotional problems\r\nof her own. When her car breaks down one day, she gets some help and borrows a\r\nmotorcycle from Luis (Manolo Cardona), a handsome Latino garage owner. Later he\r\ntakes her out for salsa dancing and margaritas, and soon enough they\u2019re in bed;\r\nbut while she\u2019s hungry for sex, she can\u2019t complete the act without coming to\r\nthe edge of a mental meltdown. No wonder, given her volatile life, that her\r\ntroubles include intimacy issues. \u201cFort Bliss\u201d grew out of documentaries about veterans of the\r\nIraq and Afghanistan wars, including \u201cThe Long Road Home\u201d and \u201cWomen at War,\u201d\r\nthat writer-director Myers previously made, and that no doubt explains both\r\npositive and not-so-positive things about it. On the plus side, the film\u2019s\r\naccount of its heroine\u2019s problems feels very accurate and informed. On the\r\nother hand, it also feels like a drama that\u2019s been made rather schematically\r\nfrom a checklist of such problems rather than more organically. Likewise,\r\nthough Myers\u2019 staging and work with her cast, especially the charismatic and\r\nskilled Monaghan, is adroit, the film\u2019s sense of style might be called\r\noff-the-rack. In times past, \u201cFort Bliss\u201d would have been called a\r\n\u201cprogrammer.\u201d There\u2019s no derogation in that description, but no particular\r\ndistinction either."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Pleasures of Being Out of Step", "Review": "I am a privileged person in many ways, but one of the ways\r\nin that I\u2019m most privileged, I sometimes think, is that I got to lay eyes on\r\nNat Hentoff\u2019s office at the Village Voice back when the legendary paper had its\r\noffices off Union Square in Manhattan. This was in the early \u201880s, at a point\r\nwhen Hentoff had produced enough work and wielded enough influence (over\r\nthinkers, not politicians or real estate moguls) to have made several careers\r\nand spanned several lifetimes. In other words, the one time jazz critic, music\r\nimpresario, and ever-tireless gadfly in defense of the First Amendment was as\r\nlegendary at the paper where he wrote a column and kept an office. That office:\r\nI\u2019d never seen anything like it before, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it\r\nsince. From floor to ceiling it held what can only be called pillars, stacked,\r\nif you can call it that, side by side by side by side, of newspapers and books.\r\nYou couldn\u2019t see the light fixture at the top of the room. The only open space\r\nin the office was its small doorway, a few steps past which was a small desk\r\nwith a typewriter and a lamp on it, and a chair in front of it.  Advertisement It was unbelievable, not just because it was a fire hazard,\r\nnot just because it was the sort of scene that inspired a weird \u201chow do you\r\nfind anything?\u201d awe. It was also a testament to Hentoff\u2019s attitude to the\r\nprinted word. He hoarded it. Crazy love, you can call it.  Sometimes, during David Lewis\u2019 engaging documentary about\r\nHentoff, \u201cThe Pleasures of Being Out Of Step,\u201d when you look behind the now\r\nnearly\u00a090-year-old Hentoff as he speaks\r\nfrom his home office\u2014he was laid off from the Voice in 2006, putting arguably\r\nthe final nail in the coffin of what that publication had once been, and stood\r\nfor\u2014you can see a version of that mess in miniature, a stray stack or two. But\r\nI wish the doc had a picture of that office, man. It would qualify for some kind\r\nof special effects Oscar, I promise.  Lewis subtitles his movie \u201cNotes on the Life of Nat\r\nHentoff,\u201d and that\u2019s wise; at less than 90 minutes in length, there\u2019s only so\r\nmuch ground it can cover. The documentary takes a thematic rather than linear\r\nchronological approach. Lewis weaves together material on Hentoff\u2019s love of\r\njazz and his shoe-leather training as a wordsmith, and tries to make a case\r\nthat the freedom that\u2019s inherent in jazz as a musical form has something to say\r\nabout the Constitution-guaranteed freedoms Hentoff has spent a good portion of\r\nhis life articulating and defending. This First Amendment absolutist, an\r\natheist and a Jew, achieved what some might consider a perverse notoriety when\r\nhe defended the right of the American Nazi Party to stage a parade in Skokie,\r\nIllinois. Years later, Hentoff, whom many of his readers had taken for granted\r\nwas a supporter of all liberal or liberal-related issues, made a lot of enemies\r\nby coming out with a stern position against abortion.\u00a0 One might not think that\r\nbouncing back and forth between Jazz Hentoff and First Amendment Hentoff would\r\nmake for consistently engaging viewing, but the movie is in fact remarkably\r\nfluid and never less than compelling. Like many biographical\r\ndocumentaries, it features an array of talking heads, but I can\u2019t think of any\r\nsuch pictures featuring such an eclectic array of such figures: poet and\r\nrhetorical firebrand Amiri Baraka, constitutional lawyer Floyd Abrams, jazz\r\ngiant Phil Woods, pioneering feminist journalist Karen Durbin, and many more,\r\nincluding Hentoff\u2019s second wife Margot, who seems in many ways as formidable a\r\nfigure as her spouse. (Full disclosure: while I\u2019ve never had the pleasure of\r\nmeeting Hentoff, Karen Durbin is a friend, as is another interviewee here, former\r\nrecord executive Regina Joskow.) The movie is also enlivened by a lot of\r\nfantastic archival footage, and again here the range is remarkable. Not many\r\nfilms boost cameos from both William F. Buckley and Thelonious Monk.\u00a0 Advertisement Despite\r\nhis rep as \u201cAlways itching for a fight,\u201d Hentoff here comes off as pretty mild\r\nmannered, and indeed his equanimity in speaking is cited by more than one\r\ninterviewee as almost maddening. He articulates his point of view with great\r\ncalm, reflecting on his \u201cbetrayals\u201d of liberalism as nothing more than facets\r\nin a lifetime of argument. An argument in which he believes he holds the\r\ncorrect opinion, of course, but an argument nonetheless. Past accusations of\r\nhomophobia and anti-feminism roll off of him like water off a duck\u2019s back, but,\r\nas a viewer, I was disappointed that he didn\u2019t address them more directly, and\r\nalso that Hentoff doesn\u2019t reflect at all on the sundered friendships so many\r\narguments have left in their wake. \u201cDon\u2019t get yourself caught up in\r\ncategories,\u201d Hentoff recalls being told by Duke Ellington. Hentoff followed\r\nthis advice while sticking like a barnacle to some very key principles. Even if\r\nyou disagree with him, the man who emerges in this portrait is both an\r\ninvaluable advocate of the arts and a moral hero. And he also wrote the liner\r\nnotes to \u201cSketches of Spain.\u201d"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Super", "Review": "\"Super\" is being sold as a comedy, but I doubt it will play that way. It begins as the portrait of a lovable loser named Frank, and as it ends, we're pretty sure he's an insane ruthless killer. That's not a joke. Maybe writer-director James Gunn intended it as a joke, but after the camera lingers on the young heroine with a third of her face blown off, it's hard to laugh. I quite understand that this could all be seen as an ironic commentary on audience expectations; when Ellen Page of \"Juno\" stars in a movie, we don't much expect to see her brains dripping. But let's face it: Most audiences have little appetite for irony about themselves. One possible way to like the movie might be to observe how unenjoyable it is for people expecting something funny and upbeat, but that would be unkind. Advertisement Rainn Wilson stars as Frank, a short-order cook who is married to the lithesome Sarah (Liv Tyler). He's a loser who is content to be a loser. He is also palpably stupid and clueless, a pawn in the hands of the slickster Jacques (Kevin Bacon). Sarah is a recovering addict, a paragon of sweetness until she falls in among low companions, including Jacques, a big-time drug dealer involved with a strip club.  When Jacques comes to Frank's house, looking for Sarah, so clueless is Frank that he cooks eggs for his rival. It must be said that Kevin Bacon plays the scene (and praises the eggs) with such wicked comic timing that you can imagine the whole film centering on that scene and flowering in other directions. It was not to be. Jacques steals Sarah, hooks her on drugs and requires her for ominous obscure purposes. Frank dissolves into self-pity. While watching a Christian cable channel, he sees a half-witted drama about a superhero and is inspired to imitate it. In search of instructional reading, he goes to a comic-book store and meets a clerk named Libby (Ellen Page), who claims she is 22 but has the savvy of a credible 8-year-old. Frank identifies Jacques with evil in general and reinvents himself as the Crimson Bolt, a masked superhero wearing a tight-fitting red suit, which he ran up himself on his wife's sewing machine. He then (this is kind of funny) hides behind Dumpsters, hoping to spot crimes being committed, and later, after getting beaten senseless, arms himself with a big wrench and starts pounding drug dealers. The Crimson Bolt becomes a big local news item, Libby figures out who he is and recruits herself as his junior sidekick, Boltie. This isn't necessarily funny. It approaches humor, however, with the work by Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page, and with the cool mocking detachment of the Kevin Bacon character, who visits as if an ambassador from another, better, movie. There's something I like very much about Wilson, who plays an unaffected klutz with about as much grace and humor as possible. He never seems to be trying to be funny, and that's a strength. But what can he do with this screenplay? Setting aside the details of the plot mechanics (Jacques, his gated mansion, his henchmen, his drugs, his evil), what we're left with are scenes of Frank the madman appointing himself as the wrath of God and smashing people senseless. When one of the Three Stooges gets beaned with a wrench, it's funny. When presumably actual characters are maimed and possibly killed, not so much.  Advertisement \"Super\" plunges into nihilistic despair in its third act. This isn't a black comedy because it isn't a comedy. It's a trick played on our expectations, I concede, but to what end? Is there any requirement that a film develop organically from beginning to end? No. There's no rule book. But audiences feel uneasy when they feel toyed with.  I'm all for movies that create unease, but I prefer them to appear to know why they're doing that. \"Super\" is a film ending in narrative anarchy, exercising a destructive impulse to no greater purpose than to mess with us."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Odd Thomas", "Review": "After reading Dean Koontz's \"Odd Thomas\" on a Vegas vacation, I thought to myself that it would someday make a fun film, perhaps even a franchise (as it has been in book form). Stephen Sommers has proven me wrong.  \"I may see dead people but then, by God, I do something about it,\" says Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin), a seemingly ordinary fry cook in Pico Mundo, California. Odd is no passive communicator with the other side; he sees ghosts but then he helps them find justice, such as in the opening scene in which he confronts the killer of a young girl who comes to Odd for help. What follows is a scene that immediately sets up \"Odd Thomas\" for failure. Odd chases the killer through neighborhoods to a pool party and Sommers' need for action tricks learned on the sets of \"The Mummy\" and \"Van Helsing\" smothers the scene in headache-inducing nonsense. Quick zooms, slow-motion fighting, loud electronic music, freeze frames\u2014it's a lesson in overused tricks and immediately one senses that a flawed project is being covered in elements designed to hide its many narrative and character mistakes. It has the clunky, haphazard look of a straight-to-video \"Scream\" rip-off.  Advertisement Odd has a girlfriend named Stormy Llewellyn (Addison Timlin)\u2014yes, seriously\u2014but Sommers' adaptation of Koontz's book is SO reliant on the twisting, supernatural narrative that we learn nothing and care not a bit about the Odd-Stormy dynamic that was such a bedrock of the source. Odd and Stormy are destined to be together forever\u2014surely a tough task for a casting agent but one that's completely bobbled here as Yelchin and Timlin have zero chemistry. Timlin has an interesting screen presence and stole the otherwise-mediocre \"Best Man Down\" last year but she's wooden and ineffective here. Fans of the book will know that an \"Odd Thomas\" without an interesting Stormy is fighting an uphill battle. Willem Dafoe looks bored as the cop who knows Odd's secret and Patton Oswalt appears in a cameo to remind fans of the book that there was an interesting character in it that's been essentially turned into a plot device.  Early on, Odd has a vision of faceless people in bowling shirts being gunned down while they scream for his help. Imagine having to stage a vision like that. It works fine on the page but making it cinematic is a challenge for which Sommers wasn't suited. It's clunky instead of dread-inducing. And Yelchin doesn't adequately sell the tension of the vision or the subsequent appearance of \"Bodachs,\" creatures who Thomas sees when something horrible is going to happen. Yelchin is an interesting actor left hung out to dry by a writer/director who can't build tension and doesn't have time for character. Odd knows something bad is going to happen. We know Odd is going to stop it. There's no movie otherwise. And so \"Odd Thomas\" becomes a film that's going through the motions with too little character, style, or atmosphere to keep it engaging. Sommers and his team rely on the narrative in Koontz's book but fail to realize that it's the character of Odd Thomas\u2014the wisecracking medium who happens to be a fry cook\u2014that made the novel a hit. By surrounding Odd with cheap special effects, wooden supporting performances, and overused camera tricks, they've given this once-promising character a fate similar to death\u2014a pretty bad movie.

{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "American Gangster", "Review": "Apart from the detail that he was a heroin dealer, Frank Lucas' career would be an ideal case study for a business school. \"American Gangster\" tells his success story. Inheriting a crime empire from his famous boss Bumpy Johnson, he cornered the New York drug trade with admirable capitalist strategies. He personally flew to Southeast Asia to buy his product directly from the suppliers, used an ingenious importing scheme to get it into the United States, and sold it at higher purity and lower cost than anyone else was able to. At the end, he was worth more than $150 million, and got a reduced sentence by cutting a deal to expose three-quarters of the NYPD narcotics officers as corrupt. And he always took his mom to church on Sunday. Advertisement Lucas is played by Denzel Washington in another one of those performances where he is affable and smooth on the outside, yet ruthless enough to set an enemy on fire. Here's a detail: As the man goes up in flames, Frank shoots him to put him out of his agony. Now that's merciful. His stubborn antagonist in the picture is a police detective named Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who gets a very bad reputation in the department. How does he do that? By finding $1 million in drug money -- and turning it in. What the hell kind of a thing is that to do, when the usual practice would be to share it with the boys? There is something inside Roberts that will not bend, not even when his powerful colleague (Josh Brolin) threatens him. He vows to bring down Frank Lucas, and he does, although it isn't easy, and his most troubling opposition comes from within the police. Lucas, the student of the late Bumpy, has a simple credo: Treat people right, keep a low profile, adhere to sound business practices and hand out turkeys on Thanksgiving. He can trust the people who work for him because he pays them very well and many of them are his relatives. In the movie, at least, Lucas is low-key and soft-spoken. No rings on his fingers, no gold around his neck, no spinners on his hubcaps, with a quiet marriage to a sweet wife and a Brooks Brothers image. It takes the authorities the longest time to figure out who he is, because they can't believe an African American could hijack the Harlem drug trade from the Mafia. The Mafia can't believe it, either, but Frank not only pulls it off, but is still alive at the end. When it was first announced, Ridley Scott's film was inevitably called \"The Black Godfather.\" Not really. For one thing, it tells two parallel stories, not one, and it really has to, because without Roberts, there would be no story to tell, and Lucas might still be in business. Advertisement But that doesn't save us from a stock female character who is becoming increasingly tiresome in the movies, the wife (Carla Gugino) who wants Roberts to choose between his job and his family. Their obligatory scenes together are recycled from a dozen or a hundred other plots, and although we sympathize with her (will they all be targeted for assassination?), we grow restless during her complaints. Roberts' domestic crisis is not what the movie is about. It is about an extraordinary entrepreneur whose story was told in a New York magazine article by Mark Jacobson. As adapted into a (somewhat fictionalized) screenplay by Steve Zaillian (\"Schindler's List\"), Lucas is a loyal driver, bodyguard and coat holder for Bumpy Johnson (who has inspired characters in three other movies, including \"The Cotton Club\"). He listens carefully to Johnson's advice, cradles him when he is dying, then takes over and realizes the fatal flaw in the Harlem drug business: The goods come in through the Mafia, after having been stepped on all along the way. So he flies to Thailand, goes upriver for a face to face with the general in charge of drugs, and is rewarded for this seemingly foolhardy risk with an exclusive contract. The drugs will come to the United States inside the coffins of American casualties, which is apparently based on fact. It's all arranged by one of his relatives. In terms of his visible lifestyle, the story of Frank Lucas might as well be the story of J.C. Penney, except that he hands out turkeys instead of pennies. Everyone in his distribution chain is reasonably happy, because the product is high quality, the price is right, and there's money for everyone. Ironically, an epidemic of overdoses occurs when Lucas' high-grade stuff is treated by junkies as if it's the usual weaker street strength. Then Lucas starts practicing what marketing experts call branding: It becomes known that his \"Blue Magic\" offers twice the potency at half the price, and other suppliers are forced off the streets by the rules of the marketplace, not turf wars. This is an engrossing story, told smoothly and well, and Russell Crowe's contribution is enormous (it's not his fault his wife complains). Looking like a care-worn bulldog, his Richie Roberts studies for a law degree, remains inviolate in his ethical standards and just keeps plugging away, building his case. The film ends not with a \"Scarface\"-style shootout, but with Frank and Richie sitting down for a long, intelligent conversation, written by Zaillian to show two smart men who both know the score. As I hinted above: less \"The Godfather\" than \"Wall Street,\" although for that matter a movie named \"American Gangster\" could have been made about Kenneth Lay. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Soul Men", "Review": "\"Soul Men\" is the one that's really going to make you miss Bernie Mac. He's so filled with life and energy here that it's hard to believe ... well, anyway. It will make you miss him. He found his comfort zone in mainstream comedies, of which I have liked nine of 12. When an edgy director like Terry Zwigoff came into the picture with \"Bad Santa\" (2003), he allowed Bernie Mac a little more depth. In \"Soul Men,\" there are scenes that hint at what he might have done in a dramatic role. It's a formula comedy, but there are real feelings here that we suspect would exist in this troubled struggle between musicians who haven't played together in 20 years. In the end credits, there are generous tributes to Bernie Mac and Isaac Hayes, also in the film, both gone from us within two days in August. Bernie gets the last, touching, word. And you know, even if I mentioned a possible heavy dramatic role, I never felt he was a comedian with a sad man inside. In the credit cookies, he talks about his good luck while thanking a theater audience (of extras) for his career, and we believe him. He seems like a comedian with a happy man inside. Advertisement Anyway, years ago Louis Jackson (Samuel L. Jackson), Floyd (Bernie Mac) and Marcus (John Legend) were a trio of big-time musicians. But Marcus split for superstardom, and the other two took separate paths to relative anonymity. Now Marcus has died and Floyd and Louis are desperately needed to appear in a memorial concert at the Apollo in Harlem. They're not even speaking to one another. Fight over a woman. For the money, Louis agrees to join Floyd in a cross-country road trip to New York. That's the formula: Two incompatible guys, long trip, one car. \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\" etc. It's Floyd's car. An El Dorado convertible. But of course it is. Ever notice how often cross-country road trips in the movies involve classic convertibles? Two reasons: The rag top makes it easier for the camera to see them, and recent cars don't look like cars. In the 1950s, kids used to stand on the corner and spot cars approaching from one or two blocks away. First kid to ID one scored a point. Chevy. Dodge. Chrysler Imperial. Studebaker. Ford. That far away, and they could even ID the model: Rocket 88. Fairlane. Golden Hawk. To kids today from a block away, unless it's a Hummer, all cars look the same. Camry. Camry. Camry. Fifty years from now, movie characters will be crossing the country in 100-year-old cars. Floyd and Louis rehash all their old differences, and encounter some remarkably friendly women (including Jennifer Coolidge, Stifler's mom). They have adventures. The beloved Caddy, with absolute inevitability, is damaged. Their spirits lift and they do one of their old routines. The trio is re-formed by adding a young singer, Cleo (Sharon Leal), who may have more to do with the trio's history than anybody realizes. At the Apollo, the reunion with Marcus and their big stage entrance are interestingly linked. This movie has a lot of good music in it, some on the soundtrack, some on the screen. Jackson and Bernie Mac have enormous fun doing intricate dance moves together. Isaac Hayes has a farewell role worthy of our memories. Of the actors, only John Legend is a little stiff, although he goes through a timeline of costumes and hair styles in the flashbacks. You want a good time? \"Soul Men\" will provide it. You want to say goodbye to Bernie Mac? He wants to say goodbye to you."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Void", "Review": "Have you ever wanted to like a movie so much because you just knew that it was made for you? I was sure that indie horror movie \"The Void\" was for me. Each new trailer and Kickstarter video (I did not crowdfund it, but I thought about it) made me more excited. Here was a gory, special-effects-driven horror film influenced by the surrealism and cosmic fear of H.P. Lovecraft and Clive Barker, and filmmakers John Carpenter, George Romero, and Lucio Fulci, especially Carpenter's \"The Thing,\" Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\" and Fulci's \"The Beyond.\"\u00a0  Advertisement   Unfortunately, \"The Void\" did not live up to my high expectations, and it didn't give me many reasons to meet it at its bar-lowering level. It is indeed an homage to Lovecraft, Barker, Carpenter, Romero and Fulci (who, when listed together, sound like the world's spookiest law firm). But co-writer/director duo Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski fail to synthesize their influences in a meaningful way. I don't want to say that this is a common problem with indie horror films, because half the fun of being a horror fan is looking for new stories amidst heaps of tired genre pastiche and shameless \"homages\" (Carpenter has especially been homaged to death within the last couple years). \"The Void\" sounds irresistible, but it's poorly paced, thinly plotted, and unimaginative throughout its bloody special effects-centric set pieces.   The film's plot is wafer-thin, but that's not the biggest problem. We follow a group of small-town residents, led by rookie cop Daniel (Aaron Poole), as they are besieged by murderous cult members, tentacle creatures/humanoid monsters with hideously deformed bodies. There's not much more to it than that. The cultists and monsters kill and/or transform anyone that opposes them, and human survivors have to kill face-less killers\u2014the cultists wear white sheets with a black triangle at the center of them\u2014lest they become the monsters that threaten their existence.   \"The Void\" is a siege narrative, so style matters more than anything, and the style here is patchy and flimsy. Where to begin? The film's frequent use of close-ups and undistinguished (and primarily dark) color palette never let me forget I was watching a low-budget film. The characters never interact with each other in a way that suggests they're thinking or feeling anything beyond a generic fight-or-flight imperative. The performances are competent, but bland. The pervasive violence is monotonous. And the antagonists, while refreshingly tactile (ie: not computer-generated), look like leftovers from earlier/better movies. Advertisement   This film's under-cooked style made me feel like I was watching a jumble of stuff I've seen before, and will see again many more times in the future. But, as much of a diehard fan of this movie's influences I am, even I didn't really care to dig out significant connections between the film's inter-related influences. Sure, the most heavily pre-visualized scenes\u2014especially nightmarish daydream visions of a foggy/cloudy Loveacraftian alien planet\u2014are effectively creepy. But these scenes don't last long, and are frequently broken up by sequences where human characters\u2014especially Daniel\u2014wander around, and poke their heads into places they probably shouldn't (seriously, do not open that door! Or use those stairs! Or enter that operating theater!). There's a hint that the film's human protagonists are being targeted because they've all experienced or are close to somebody who has experienced childbirth-related loss.\u00a0   But beyond that, I honestly couldn't tell you what \"The Void\" is about aside from a blind need to establish Gillespie and Kostanaski's technical skills as horror filmmakers. It reminds me of an exchange from \"Six Feet Under,\" where an art school teacher ruthlessly dismisses one of his students' work by telling the young artist that he isn't saying anything with his art beyond showing off which artists he's chosen to define his personality with. \"The Void\" is similarly a work by a group of young, unformed voices. People live, people die, monsters creep out of the shadows, but it's all a little too formulaic, cynical, and ... well, boring. That's the worst thing I can say about \"The Void\": I didn't really care who would survive, or what would be left of them. I also didn't feel like the film was consistently bloody, or unhinged enough to hold my attention. \"The Void\" didn't need to be the film of my dreams, but man, did it have to be so dull?"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "What Happened, Miss Simone?", "Review": "Liz Garbus\u2019 \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?,\u201d premiering on\r\nNetflix this Friday after opening this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, falls\r\njust short of greatness but captures enough of the remarkable story and talent\r\nof its subject that it warrants a look. Your mileage for a film like this often\r\ncomes down to how much the viewer knows about the subject. I knew very little\r\nabout the life of Nina Simone, although I did sense that if you are more\r\neducated on her life story, there may not be enough here that truly enlightens.\r\nGarbus\u2019 approach fluctuates from standard, music doc talking-head appreciations\r\nto long performances from archival video that are simply mesmerizing. Nina Simone\r\ncould hold an audience in such rapt attention that when she stops a song at one\r\npoint in \u201cWhat Happened\u201d and orders someone to sit down, you almost don\u2019t blame\r\nher. And \u201cWhat Happened\u201d features some of the best concert footage and musical\r\nperformances in recent music doc memory, even if it never quite answers the\r\nquestion in its title. Advertisement Nina Simone lived more than enough life for a documentary\r\nlike Garbus\u2019. Intercutting concert footage, talking-head interviews with people\r\nwho knew her (mostly her daughter), and audio of an interview conducted with\r\nSimone years ago, \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d episodically captures all the\r\nbig moments of its subject\u2019s life. It starts with the loneliness of practicing\r\npiano as a child, with the stated desire to become a prodigy. It took seven or\r\neight hours a day of practice. And it\u2019s important to note that Simone was doing\r\nsomething \u201cwhite,\u201d literally crossing the tracks to take her piano lessons, and\r\nfeeling ostracized by both communities\u2014unwelcome by the whites who felt she was\r\ninvading their world and pushed out by her own community at the same time. Simone went to Juilliard for a year and half, but was denied\r\napplication to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. She was good enough but\r\nher race held her back, and the hard truth that she couldn\u2019t practice enough to\r\novercome institutional racism hurt her greatly, impacting the way she would\r\nrespond to the civil rights movement later in her life. She got a job in Atlantic\r\nCity at a dive bar. Imagine seeing Nina Simone playing at a crummy bar in\r\nAtlantic City. She honed her diverse skills there, moving out of classical\r\ntraining to \u201cbar music,\u201d and being told she had to sing to keep the job. And,\r\nwow, could she sing. Garbus makes the very smart decision to allow Simone\u2019s\r\ntalent to be the main subject of \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d We see some songs\r\nin their entirety, like a breathtaking \u201cI Love You, Porgy\u201d from a Playboy\r\nPenthouse broadcast and a closing number that I won\u2019t spoil but lands a\r\ndeserved standing ovation. Whenever the presentation starts to feel a bit too \u201cBehind\r\nthe Music\u201d standard, the music and its creator elevate it. It\u2019s certainly never\r\ndull, even if I wish Garbus had found an approach as unique as her subject.\r\nNina Simone had so much to say. We don\u2019t need quite so much of her daughter\u2019s\r\nimpressions of her when the music often says so much more. Advertisement As so many music docs do, \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d\r\neventually gets truly dark. Simone\u2019s husband/manager abused her, not only\r\npushing her too hard to work but physically beating her in front of her child.\r\nSimone had gotten to the top of the mountain in terms of her career, but there\r\nwas still so much pain and evil in her life, which you can certainly hear in a\r\nlot of her music. When the civil rights movement became an important part of\r\nher life, Simone expressed her belief that violence was the answer to achieving\r\nequality. It wouldn\u2019t be given; it had to be taken. And that outspokenness hurt\r\nher career, pushing her deeper into a life spent in depression and even leading\r\nto her passing the physical abuse she had received on to her child. Garbus\r\ndoesn\u2019t shy away from the darkness that Simone not only experienced but forced\r\non others.  Netflix has become a major player when it comes to\r\ntelevision but the jury is still out as to whether or not they will matter as\r\nmuch in the world of film.

{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Isle of Dogs", "Review": "The dogs are very furry.\u00a0 The look of the animal \u201cactors\u201d in \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d is the film\u2019s best feature. At times, it's hard to resist the urge to muss the imperfect fur that has been painstakingly rendered by director Wes Anderson\u2019s animators. Especially if you\u2019re a dog lover. As in \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox,\u201d the stop-motion creatures take on the facial characteristics of the actors who play them, adding a comfortable layer of familiarity. Unlike that Roald Dahl adaptation, \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d does not have a compelling story, and even worse, it has the most egregious examples of its director\u2019s privilege since \u201cThe Darjeeling Limited.\u201d This movie really pissed me off, and the only thing I found soothing while watching it was silently repeating to myself \u201cthe dogs are very furry.\u201d Reminding myself of the film\u2019s best asset kept me from walking out. Advertisement Anderson has gone on record citing the influence of legendary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki on \u201cIsle of Dogs.\u201d Films like \u201cSpirited Away\u201d and \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d depict Miyazaki\u2019s visions of Japan in ways that are both awe-inspiringly beautiful and terrifying. Even in his least successful ventures, the attention to world-building detail is staggering. You would think Anderson would be the perfect director to pay homage to this master of animation; no other director working today has a bigger compulsion for visuals than Anderson. But unlike the warm Miyazaki, Anderson is a very cold director. He keeps everything at an annoying hipster\u2019s ironic distance, valuing aesthetics over meaning and context. This may work in the spaces of Anderson\u2019s meticulously crafted universe of films like \u201cRushmore\u201d and \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums,\u201d but \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d is set in an actual foreign country whose culture and traditions Anderson unwisely commandeers. The results are cringe-worthy. \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d takes place in Anderson\u2019s rather skewed interpretation of Japan. It\u2019s a place where every explosion is rendered as a cutesy mushroom cloud and the public speeches always include haiku. It\u2019s also a place where man\u2019s best friend has been banished due to a dangerous outbreak of \u201cdog flu,\u201d which is apparently harmful to humankind. However, instead of being euthanized, each infected canine is dropped on a trash-filled island that evokes memories of \u201cWall-E.\u201d As a show of solidarity with dismayed dog owners throughout the city of Megasaki, its mayor deports his own dog, Spots (voice of Liev Schreiber). Spots is the first of many dogs who will inhabit Trash Island, and he is the only one who\u2019s privy to a rescue mission from the mainland. 12-year old Atari (voice of Koyu Rankin) is the mayor\u2019s ward, an orphan whose parents were killed in a tragic accident. Spots was his companion and his security detail. He and Atari wore earpieces which served as a tracking device. Atari plans to use his earpiece to help him find his beloved pet. After crash landing his plane on the island, Atari meets the group of alpha dogs who serve as the film\u2019s main characters. They\u2019re a motley crew to say the least, and despite being born and raised in Japan, they don\u2019t understand Japanese at all. Advertisement There\u2019s the leader Chief (voice of Bryan Cranston) who fancies himself the group\u2019s leader despite the group\u2019s reliance on democratically deciding every decision. (Chief always takes the only contrarian vote, rendering him powerless.) There\u2019s also former sports mascot Boss (voice of Bill Murray), who is still wearing his team\u2019s jersey, and mustachioed former dog food commercial star King (voice of Bob Balaban). Scarlett Johansson shows up in a thankless role as the only female dog to have any dialogue. Chief calls her a bitch at one point, which I suppose is accurate as far as Webster\u2019s is concerned. Rounding out the alpha dog crew are Rex (voice of Edward Norton) and Duke (voice of Jeff Goldblum), who is so gossipy he puts Wendy Williams, Benita Butrell and TMZ to shame. When not getting information from a pug named Oracle, the dogs rely on gossip as their primary means of information. To quote \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d they\u2019re \u201cworse than a sewing circle.\u201d Perhaps some of this potential misinformation will help Atari find Spots. Back in Megasaki, a dog-loving scientist voiced by \u201cThe Last Samurai\u201d\u2019s Ken Watanabe is testing a dog flu antidote serum he\u2019s created with his colleague Yoko (voiced by, you guessed it, Yoko Ono). The cat-loving mayor has nefarious reasons for keeping the serum from succeeding, and he isn\u2019t above murder as a preventive method. Judging by this and \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel,\u201d I get the feeling Wes Anderson doesn\u2019t like cats. As a dog person myself, I understand. But cat lovers may find their scapegoating here a bit problematic. Far, far more problematic is the character of Tracy (voice of Greta Gerwig). Tracy is an exchange student investigating the ouster of dogs for the school newspaper. She\u2019s the only White person in \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d and she is the film\u2019s White savior. It is she who rallies the protesters against the mayor, raising her hand in what looks suspiciously like the Black Power salute (which, if you recall, Anderson last rendered on a wolf in \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d). Speaking of Black Power, Tracy sports a hairstyle you\u2019d normally find on Black people or, in a less extreme fashion, on Art Garfunkel. If Rankin-Bass were to do \u201cThe Rachel Dolezal Story,\u201d they could hire Tracy, though in Ms. Dolezal\u2019s defense, she\u2019d at least know how to make an Afro look convincing. Advertisement Since most of the townspeople are against the mayor\u2019s decree, this exchange student is a completely extraneous character who denies hometown residents the opportunity to be heard. The optics of her mere existence are disturbing in a film in 2018. The only time \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d reaches for your sympathy is when Tracy is faced with deportation back to Cincinnati. And in the film\u2019s most disgusting leverage of its privilege, Tracy physically assaults the grieving Yoko to get her to act against the crimes perpetrated upon her by the state. \u201cThe dogs are very furry,\u201d I said as this scene played out. \u201cThe dogs are very furry!\u201d There\u2019s a lot of Japanese in \u201cIsle of Dogs,\u201d most of it untranslated by subtitles. When it is translated, it\u2019s by an onscreen character voiced by Frances McDormand. Who wouldn\u2019t want \u201cFargo\u201d\u2019s Marge Gundersen as their personal Babelfish? Perhaps a better question would be \u201cwhy aren\u2019t the Japanese people translated?\u201d Atari, who is the catalyst for this story, remains untranslated until the very end, where most of his speech is in deference to how hot he finds Tracy, with whom he has had no prior interaction. I suppose Anderson thought he was being respectful toward Japanese speakers by giving them something only they could enjoy (much like Pixar does with Spanish in \u201cCoco\u201d). Instead, it only adds an \u201cOtherness\u201d to Atari and his compatriots. Why can we understand Atari\u2019s canine cohort, but not him? As always, the imagery is the best part of any Anderson film. \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d is uglier and more devoid of color than Anderson\u2019s prior works, but I liked the somewhat noirish appeal of the grunginess of Trash Island. The canine voice actors know how to speak Anderson\u2019s dialogue and make it seem natural coming from their snouts. But as entertaining as it is to look at \u201cIsle of Dogs,\u201d I couldn\u2019t get past Anderson\u2019s usual clumsiness when dealing with minorities. This is a film where a character is\u00a0literally\u00a0whitewashed, an act that makes him more agreeable afterwards. \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d treats this as a sight gag. It plays more like a confession. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Before We Vanish", "Review": "There's a lot of dead air in the endearingly eccentric Japanese science-fiction thriller \"Before We Vanish.\" That's bound to be a\u00a0deal-breaker for many viewers given that this film clocks in at 130 minutes, and feels like it could easily\u00a0be\u00a0half as long. Then again, you shouldn't really expect much story or character development from this \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\"-like alien invasion drama. Think of \"Before We Vanish\" as a very laid back hang-out movie that often coasts on off-kilter charm, and is frequently buoyed by basic, but stirring\u00a0ideas that co-writer/director Kiyoshi Kurosawa (\"Pulse,\" \"Tokyo Sonata\") executes with characteristic flair. It's an unsettling, and sometimes high-concept doodle, but it's awfully hard to resist a film that marries Atomic Age paranoia and optimism with Kurosawa's signature\u00a0post-modern, atmosphere-intensive\u00a0style. Advertisement The plot, co-adapted with Sachiko Tanaka from Tomohiro Maekwa's source play, is simple enough. Three aliens crash-land on Earth shortly before a planned planet-wide\u00a0invasion. We are told this by the three disoriented\u00a0Pod People in question: Shinji (Ryuhei Matsuda), Akira (Yuri Tsunematsu), and Amano (Mahiro Takasugi). But that's almost all we know for sure about these extra-terrestrials for a while since getting straight answers from Shinji's group is rather difficult. Shinji and his fellow E.T.s\u00a0latch on to human by-standers, like Shinji's perplexed wife Narumi (Masami Nagasawa) and cynical reporter Sakurai (Hiroki Hasegawa), because they\u00a0don't understand complex concepts, and are therefore\u00a0easily confused, and sidetracked. Then again, dispelling that confusion\u00a0seems to\u00a0be\u00a0these aliens's true purpose. They spend much of their time trying to\u00a0understand\u00a0complex concepts like \"ownership\"\u00a0and \"family.\" The aliens learn by a bizarre psychic process that allows\u00a0them\u00a0to mentally\u00a0absorb\u00a0big\u00a0ideas from reluctant\u00a0humans' brains. But once the transfer is complete, the human victim\u00a0instantly forget whatever abstract theories were taken from them.\u00a0  Kurosawa and Tanaka run a fair distance with that tantalizing concept: what happens to people when they're no longer sure of their character-defining\u00a0obligations? The first couple of\u00a0brain-washed humans\u00a0are all happy, but\u00a0useless in a society that they no longer mindlessly, but pragmatically devote themselves to. For example:\u00a0Narumi's boss has a childish\u00a0tantrum after he forgets about his inhumane profit-driven concept of \"work.\" But that reaction is too close\u00a0to the experience of the\u00a0man who prowls the streets\u00a0with a crazed,\u00a0child-like grin\u00a0after he's liberated of the concept of \"ownership.\" And that response is too close to the one had by an unhinged\u00a0middle-aged\u00a0woman who now no longer remembers what \"family\" is. We get it, we are prisoners of our beliefs. What now? Soon, the aliens and their warily\u00a0sympathetic\u00a0human guides start to bond, though sometimes for unclear reasons. In one of the film's biggest highlights,\u00a0Sakurai\u00a0tries to warn his fellow humans of the impending invasion. He tells a crowd of dazed\u00a0on-lookers exactly\u00a0what's happening: aliens are coming, and they're taking the values that we hold most dear. Everybody stares blankly at him, as if to suggest that we are, in fact, the\u00a0real pod people. This is the kind of scene\u00a0that's either\u00a0ultimately\u00a0childish or inspiring,\u00a0depending on how well-executed it is.\u00a0Thankfully, Kurosawa\u00a0intuitively emphasizes\u00a0Tsunematsu's stiff\u00a0body language, and\u00a0the blank expressions on the people that Sakurai addresses. I was\u00a0reminded of the iconic scene in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\"\u00a0where Jimmy Stewart collapses right after\u00a0he's practically buried alive in a mountain of constituents' letters.\u00a0Kurosawa's scene is\u00a0crucial\u00a0in a similar way: this is the moment\u00a0where\u00a0despair finally\u00a0gives way to a transporting optimism\u00a0that carries the film to its corny, but\u00a0well-executed finale. Advertisement Some viewers might not\u00a0like the way that the tone of\u00a0\"Before We Vanish\" often drifts\u00a0between emotional extremes. Some might not\u00a0enjoy the arch tone of the film's more unabashedly hopeful scenes. Some will want more\u00a0naturalistic dialogue, or\u00a0a more\u00a0well-rounded narrative. I can't blame them, or tell them they're wrong for wanting what they want. But I will\u00a0recommend\u00a0\"Before\u00a0We Vanish\" anyway, just because\u00a0its naive hopefulness is infectious, and\u00a0its big\u00a0ideas are captivating. This is the kind of movie that's destined to inspire a hardcore\u00a0cult of fans, and will maybe even lead the next\u00a0generation of genre\u00a0filmmakers\u00a0to tinker with their own big ideas. A little dead air is a small price to pay for that kind of lingering happiness."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Harmony and Me", "Review": "Austin, Texas, has never looked more unlovely, and its residents more clueless, than in \"Harmony and Me,\" a funny, wry mumblecore comedy by Bob Byington. Remember Richard Linklater's \"Waking Life,\" about a curious soul who explored Austin encountering one fascinating and original person after another? Harmony, the hero of this film, doesn't know a single fascinating person and never visits a part of town that doesn't look like an anonymous suburb. \tYou know what mumblecore is, don't you? That's an imperfect term for a genre of imperfect low-budget films in which mostly young characters wander through unsatisfactory lives characterized by alienation, boredom and angst. They usually don't have enough energy to be angry-- and besides, who would care? They do, however, have dialog that's nicely sardonic, as when Harmony observes \"I have a pretty strict policy about high fives\" and \"I grew up with limited access to mental health.\" Advertisement \tHarmony is played by Justin Rice as a low-energy version of Michael Cera. He looks as if he wishes he had the strength to seem as tragic as he thinks he probably is. He's been dumped by the pretty Jessica (Kristen Tucker), who confides to a friend she was able to shorten the grieving period after the breakup of their romance by starting early to grieve, at its halfway point. How can you grieve the end of something that hasn't ended? Preventative grieving, maybe it's called. Maybe grieving ahead for a rainy day. \tIn his low-key, absent way, Harmony has an action-packed life. He gets fired from his vague software job after unwisely calling his boss's father a pedophile during the graveside service. He has a medical emergency during which nurses place bandages on his head for practice. He attends his brother's wedding. He's lectured on marriage by a buddy whose wife's face confirms our suspicion that he's the husband from hell. \tMostly, Harmony mopes. Remember that old Irish crime, \"Mopery with intent to gawk?\" Harmony mopes and gawks. His life has been destroyed by Jessica, he moans. She is perfect. How could she treat him this way? His pal consoles him: He's only about an 8. For a 10, you have to go to Lebanon, South America, places like that. \t\"Harmony and Me\" has its Chicago premiere starting Friday at the Gene Siskel Film Center. If I've made Harmony himself sound boring, don't assume the movie is. Bob Byington directs with an exact sense of what he wants; consider the perfect timing of his use of Harmony's mom (Margie Beegle). How she says \"don't ask me\" and \"leave me out of it\" is unreasonably funny.  The movie plays at 8 p.m. Friday (10/30), 3:15 and 8 p.m. Saturday, 3:15 o.m Sunday, 6:15 p.m. Monday and Tuesday, and 8:15 p.m Thursday. Byington will be present.\t Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Divorce Corp", "Review": "The inevitable DVD of \"Divorce Corp\" will make an ideal gift for anyone who's been through a painful, expensive split-up. Directed by Joseph Sorge, whose web site offers a tie-in book, it's billed as \"A shocking expos\u00e9 of the inner workings of the $50 billion a year U.S. family law industry\" that \"shines a bright light on the appalling waste, and shameless collusive practices seen daily in family courts.\"  Those intensifiers should tell you what you're in for. \"Divorce Corp\" is less a nuanced documentary than a cry of rage. It's easy to imagine people who've shelled out a small fortune during a contested divorce, with or without kids underfoot, watching this film while nodding their heads and muttering, \"Amen. Stick it to 'em.\"  Advertisement Although it sometimes wanders off the righteous path to recount a depressing or perverse anecdote at length\u2014such as the tale of a ridiculously expensive child custody evaluator who bragged of drug use and unprotected group sex on Facebook\u2014for the most part it's a stylistically bland work. \"Divorce Corp\" is directed and edited at roughly the same level of imagination as a network newsmagazine story: talking head, talking head, talking head, cut to a chart, exterior shot of a courthouse, cut to another chart, talking head, capped by a segue along the lines of, \"And if you think that's shocking, wait'll you hear this.\"  Any wit it exhibits is of the slow-twisting-of-the-knife variety. A sequence that picks apart the undefined legal phrase \"the best interest of the child\" is scored to a section of \"March of the Sugarplum Fairies.\" Animated re-creations of witnesses' stories contain odd moments of caricature, as when a faceless stick figure representing a child custody evaluator takes a parent's hard-earned money and bolts like a cartoon swindler trying to make the next train out of town. That said, I'd be shocked if anyone involved with \"Divorce Corp\" gave the briefest thought to making an artistic statement. This picture is just a statement, period\u2014something like, \"Divorce in the United States is needlessly complicated, expensive, unfair, and sometimes corrupt. Won't someone do something about it, for pity's sake?\" The damning facts and figures keep piling up, along with horror stories that give them human faces. The average contested divorce in the United State of America costs $50,000. Lawyers on both sides of a case crank out redundant paperwork, unnecessary motions and pointless letters because they get paid by the hour. Costs climb so high that soon-to-be-former spouses have to sell cars, houses and other possessions to pay legal fees, and sometimes judges pre-emptively denude their net worth by placing liens on their property. Nobody involved wants to end what this movie calls \"the revenue stream.\" Judges are officially or unofficially in bed with lawyers for both spouses, as well as the various experts they assign to cases. It's a mutual backscratching thing. If the judge takes care of these people today, once the judge retires the recipients of largesse will take care of him, perhaps by hiring him to serve as a mediator or consultant.  Advertisement Adding incompetence to corruption, the family court system is a steaming mess. Its various sections aren't governed by constitutional edicts that other institutions must follow. Power-tripping judges can indulge God complexes by lashing out against plaintiffs who protest their decisions. At one point the film tells of a man who wrote about his experiences in family court online and was ordered to delete his blog by the judge overseeing his divorce. This is but one of many examples the film gives of judges behaving like old-time ward bosses or petty gangsters. There are no stories in \"Divorce Corp\" of fair judges or decent lawyers or government employees who are good at their jobs, and little analysis of the larger systemic problems that might account for some of the horror stories. It's not that kind of film.  The fact that \"Divorce Corp\" is railing against targets that it's safe to hate (cold-hearted and anonymous institutions, incompetent evaluators, sleazy lawyers, corrupt or petty judges) gives it darkly exhilarating quality. If you want to let off steam, it's cheaper to go out into a field and scream your head off than to buy a ticket to see it; but then you wouldn't have the pleasure of seeing prominent lawyer Gloria Allred admit on camera that the goal of most attorneys in divorce cases is to \"paper the other side until they can't take it anymore.\" If this movie were a person, it would be the kind of person you'd avoid because you fear he might explode one day and you'd rather not be there when it happens."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Trishna", "Review": "\"Trishna\" tells the story of a beautiful woman who is cruelly mistreated by a cold-blooded man. This man is so clueless, so emotionally tone-deaf, that his brutality threatens to undermine the film. That becomes all the more puzzling because he doesn't begin that way. He undergoes a change in his nature that it's hard for us to understand on an emotional level. And that isn't a weakness in the story but a strange kind of strength; we watch in horror as a tragedy unfolds. The title character is played by the touchingly beautiful Freida Pinto, who you will remember from \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (2008). By \"touchingly,\" I mean that in the way she plays this particular character, beauty becomes like a handicap. No woman so completely without resources should be forced to live with it. Her Trishna is a gentle, sweet, completely good young woman of 19, who lives with her family in a poor rural district of India. After her father is disabled in a road accident, she becomes the wage earner. This could mean working in the fields or in her uncle's factory \u2014 or making a good city salary on the staff of a luxury hotel. Advertisement It happens this way. Trishna catches the eye of a young man named Jay (Riz Ahmed), the son of a wealthy hotel owner. He has been educated in England and has returned home, is struck by her beauty and her plight, and offers her a job in his father's hotel. He does this out of kindness, and she accepts out of necessity. At first, all goes well. He sponsors her for a course in hotel management. She is good at her work.  Then, abruptly, his behavior changes. They had seemed to be falling in love, a romance that would cross class barriers but nevertheless seems possible to both of them. Then, at a tender moment, after a kiss, he grows aggressive. Whether he rapes her is left unclear, but she is in so much dismay that she returns immediately to her father's home. Won't tell you all that happens next. Let me briefly say that Jay comes looking for her and takes her to Mumbai, where they share a flat and become lovers, and she lives with him on the fringes of Bollywood. She even begins dancing classes, and it isn't unthinkable that she could find a movie career. But at every step of the way, all the money is his. When he flies to London to be with his sick father, she learns the lease on the flat has expired. This monster has again abandoned her. When he finds and \"rescues\" her another time, it is to return her to the world of a hotel employee, where she is expected to secretly continue as his mistress. His studies in the Kama Sutra lead him to sexual experiments that are repulsive to her. Michael Winterbottom's film is based on Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891). That also was about romance that violated class distinctions. Its heroine became involved with two men, one much nicer than the other, and by combining those characters into the single character of Jay, Winterbottom is unable successfully to explain why the Jay at the beginning is so different than the Jay at the end. In any event, Trisha is equally powerless early and late \u2014 and just as much so at home, where her father treats her coldly and demands her wages, while ignoring what she does to earn them. The foundation of the story is the cruel inequality of the sexes in this sample of Indian society and the way her world has set up Trishna as a victim. I'm not sure if she ever understands how beautiful she is. But if she were less beautiful, she might have been able to lead a happier life. Pinto's Trishna is so naive she has little real understanding of the situation Jay has put her in, once and again and again. For that matter, I don't understand why he is so needlessly cruel, because he could have what he wants, anyway. He has all the cards.  Advertisement Winterbottom is a director who never repeats himself, films all over the world, and in \"Trishna,\" effortlessly embeds his story in modern India. It's possible to imagine it happening in a hotel not far from the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. India as always fascinates with its beauty and complexities. Winterbottom avoids any attempt to sentimentalize, and the realism of his film has a pitiless brutality. I felt such sympathy for Trishna. I felt such contempt for Jay. As a melodrama, \"Trishna\" builds a hypnotic force."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Devil's Knot", "Review": "\"Devil's Knot\" is in an impossible bind. I'd wager that almost no one seeing this movie will be ignorant of its real-life inspiration: the 1993 murders and mutilations of three little boys in West Memphis, Arkansas, and the hysteria-tinged court case that led to the conviction and subsequent release of three local teens for murder. Given the harrowing subject matter, it's hard to imagine viewers seeking out \"Devil's Knot\" without knowing a bit about the case. They may have seen Amy Berg's 2012 documentary \"West of Memphis\" or one or more of Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky's \"Paradise Lost\" documentaries, which are as gripping and mournful as \"In Cold Blood,\" \"The Executioner's Song\" and other classic true crime books. \u00a0And they will be disappointed by \"Devil's Knot.\" Advertisement The film is a respectful, intelligent real-life drama about the effect of ghastly crimes on a community, and the role that hysteria, social stereotyping and religious bigotry played in it. (The three teens convicted of the crimes were targeted partly because they were pipsqueak rebels, defining themselves against their Bible-belt town by listening to heavy metal and worshiping Satan.) But it's not penetrating or insightful enough to erase or even compete with memories of the real-life participants as they appeared in news stories and documentary features. Truth might not be stranger than fiction, but it's surely messier, and often more surprising. The best nonfiction filmmaking (and traditional written journalism) makes characters in a real-life narrative come alive as individuals; the works do double-duty as stories and portrait galleries. This scripted film has few such virtues. It covers familiar ground in a haphazard way. There are too many major characters and too many points of emphasis. As elegantly directed as it sometimes is, it feels disjointed, scattered. In trying to touch on every important aspect of one chunk of the story (the timeline ends in 1994) \"Devil's Knot\" treats everything glancingly. It's a grab-bag of vivid, affecting moments that don't add up. I'm tempted to say it should have been a miniseries, but that would make the nagging sense of redundancy more piercing. Don't fault the actors. They do solid work in roles that often seem like awkward fits. Reese Witherspoon brings a brittle anger to the role of Pam Hobbs, mom of one of the victims, Steve Branch.\u00a0Alessandro Nivola is an ominously good match as Pam\u2019s controlling husband, who is suggested (and not just in this version) as an alternate suspect. \"You're supposed to be a grieving mother,\" he warns Pam, \"start acting like one.\" That he frames his warning in terms of a performance says a lot.\u00a0 The fish-out-of-water award goes to Colin Firth as Ron Lax, a private investigator from Memphis who donates his services to the suspects' defense and uncovers many suspicious and ultimately damning facts. Firth's Appalachian accent is solid, and he plays Lax as a city guy trying not to condescend to rural folks; if you're used to seeing him play roles in his own accent (or something close) he takes some getting used to, but he brings a somewhat hesitant dignity that's fascinating in this context.  The young actors playing suspects\u00a0Damien Echols (James Hamrick), Jason Baldwin (Seth Meriwether) and Jessie Misskelley Jr. (Kris Higgins) are all subtle, committed actors, but here again it's difficult to watch them without wishing you were watching the people their characters are based on. This sensation is especially acute in Echols' case. In the Berlinger and Sinofsky documentaries especially, Echols came off as one of the most maddening and ultimately fascinating characters in modern crime reportage. The West Memphis three's case dragged on for 18 years, ending in their 2011 release under what's known as an\u00a0Alford Plea; this arrangement lets the state save face by releasing criminals whose convictions were problematic, but without admitting they imprisoned the wrong people. In the preceding years you saw Echols' personality evolve, beginning in youthful arrogance, ignorance and adolescent playacting, then maturing (and hardening) into angry bitterness before finally ending in devastated wisdom, every last trace of snotty defiance crushed out of him by life. If broader, deeper portraits of Echols and other key participants weren't so readily available, we could be satisfied with the off-putting slivers of characterization offered in \"Devil's Knot.\" But they are, so we can't. For a devotee of this particular story, watching this feature is akin to having spent years immersed in the daily life of a foreign land, then experiencing it the next time during an afternoon layover in that country's busiest airport. Advertisement The film's director, Atom Egoyan, is a great cinematic poet of despair and dissatisfaction. His early films \"Speaking Parts,\" \"The Adjuster\" and \"Exotica\" were intellectualized but curiously pulpy looks at groups of people whose only shared trait was soul-deep dissatisfaction. He later extended this talent into tales of war, terror and atrocity, including \"Adoration,\" \"Felicia's Journey,\" \"Ararat\" and his acclaimed movie version of Russell Banks' novel \"The Sweet Hereafter,\" a sort of collective psychic autopsy of a community following a school bus crash.\u00a0\"Devil's Knot\" strives for the mix of empathy and despair that Egoyan perfected in the latter film, but it's undone by a desire to be everywhere at once. Only the movie's precise visuals and sound design\u2014every composition and camera movement reflecting the feelings of the characters or the interest of the story, and the crickets and frogs trilling constantly in the background\u2014keeps it from feeling like a TV movie. There are images strong enough to break the torpor\u2014the image of a detective lifting a naked boy's corpse from swamp water is one you'll wish you could un-see\u2014but they aren't enough."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Yes Men Fix the World", "Review": "Consider the \"SurvivaBall.\" This is a fake survival suit, built by the Yes Men but presented as a new product from Halliburton. This is an inflated padded globe completely containing a human body, and round as a beach ball. Obviously, if you fell over, you'd have no way to stop yourself from rolling, or be able to stand up on your own. There's a closable face opening, air filters, little extendable gloves and a port that, unless I miss my guess, is intended for extra-suit urination. It comes with the big red Halliburton trademark. Advertisement In the post-9/11 paranoia, the Yes Men seriously pitch this invention at a conference for the security industry. Study the faces in the audience. No one is laughing. People look bored or perhaps mildly curious. There isn't a look of incredulity in the room. The few questions are desultory. Not a single security \"expert\" seems to suspect a hoax. Experts in the news business are no more suspicious. The Yes Men faked a BBC interview during which a \"spokesman for Dow Chemical\" announced a multibillion-dollar payment to the victims of a notorious 1985 explosion at a Union Carbide insecticide factory in Bhopal, India, that killed 8,000, injured many more and spread poisons that cause birth defects to this day.  Think of that. Twice as many dead as on 9/11, we know exactly who did it and Dow (which absorbed Union Carbide) has never paid a dime of reparation. At the news it was finally settling the suit, Dow Chemical's stock price plunged on Wall Street: Things like this could cost money. The Yes Men were unmasked as the hoaxers. They were also behind a stunt that made the news recently: staging a phony press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, announcing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was reversing its stand on global warming. Some news organizations double-checked this, but not Fox News, which repeated the story all day. Another hoax, inspiring the question: Why does the U.S. Chamber of Commerce resist the theory of global warming? What is the USCC, anyway? Is it supported by the dues of countless merchants on Main Street, or is it a front financed by energy companies? Only a month ago, Exelon, the largest U.S. electric utility, announced it would no longer pay dues to support the USCC right-wing agenda. The Yes Men are represented in this documentary by Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonnano. You may have seen them on TV -- as themselves, or as \"corporate spokesmen.\" It's remarkable no one recognizes them. They don't wear beards or dark glasses. They are disguised, in fact, in a way that makes them above suspicion: Why, they look and talk exactly like middle-aged white men in conservative business suits.  Advertisement The film is entertaining in its own right, and thought-provoking. Why don't more people quickly see through their hoaxes? A photo of Bichlbaum and Bonnano with the SurvivaBall appears with this review. Would you believe in such a product? As head of security for your corporation, would you invest in it? It is surprising we don't look outside and see, coming down the street, a parade of emperors without any clothes. \u201cYes Man\u201d Mike Bonanno will appear live at the Music Box Theater theater on Friday, October 30th at the 7:10pm and 9:20pm shows."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Psychopaths", "Review": "When Steven Soderbergh announced he was retiring from cinema, he lamented about seeing a fellow passenger on an airplane watch only the action scenes in a list of loud movies, skipping the dialogue and story. The director called this \u201cmayhem porn,\u201d a designation and ideology fitting for\u00a0the latest from indie director Mickey Keating, \u201cPsychopaths.\" The film is\u00a0an active, obnoxious test of an audience\u2019s appetite for blood and how long they can go without\u00a0novel ideas like purpose or plot.\u00a0 In the history of lazy conceits for mass violence, \u201cPsychopaths\u201d proudly throws itself towards the bottom. A serial killer (played by horror icon Larry Fessenden, who also executive produced) has just been executed, and the evil within his soul has spread throughout Los Angeles. Not in any direct visual way, but enough so that this script can focus on violence as a type of trending topic for the night.\u00a0 Advertisement \"The Purge\" films, of which \u201cPsychopaths\u201d will owe many of\u00a0its viewers, nudge that violence is an epidemic that we choose to embrace. But any idea of treating \"Psychopaths\" as a type of commentary on how violence is a force beyond consciousness\u00a0is muffled early, as violence becomes an action to create whatever \u201cPsychopaths\u201d thinks looks cool. Overhead shots of torture weapons, shadowy long takes of people being shot in darkness\u2014it\u2019s all just about killing people for the sake of killing people. Ho hum.\u00a0 A plot\u00a0does not materialize so much as characters of questionable backgrounds and expansive capacities for violence. In an elegantly composed one-shot, a man is introduced attacking a woman, strangling her, and killing someone that comes to the rescue. Played by James Landry Hebert and a distinct mustache, he\u2019s known as The Strangler, naturally. But the night has other things in store for him when he meets Blondie (Angela Trimbur), a killer of her own right, with her own stone face and\u00a0campy desire to torture.\u00a0 Evil lurks elsewhere in the valley, like in the soul of a singer named Alice (Ashley Bell, a Keating MVP), who is introduced with a brightly-lit\u00a0stage performance of \u201cLet Me Call You Sweetheart.\u201d She turns out to be a psychopath too, indicated by a schizophrenic, fourth wall-breaking monologue that fluctuates between her normal voice and one of a demon. Later on, she attacks a quaint yet quarreling suburban couple. For a movie that essentially has its production design done by Halloween, her hamminess is more spirited than most character flourishes here.\u00a0 Advertisement And yes, given that this is a movie about psychopaths, there are some killers in masks, some of their violence involving the weak script idea of revenge. But as a character shrugs in the script, fitting with the film's middle school-level interest in wisdom: \u201cThere ain\u2019t no why to evil.\u201d\u00a0 All this carnage is loosely connected, sometimes with different attacks spliced back and forth, but the stakes are zilch. Characters, whether considered to be psychopaths or not, are treated with the care of blood bags that exist simply to explode, if not before a menacing soundtrack needle-drop or rambling monologue. For whatever inspiration \u201cPsychopaths\u201d has, as a type of chaos so pure that it lacks substance, it drags. To call it an \u201cexperiment\u201d would be to acknowledge that it has a purpose. \u201cExercise\u201d might be a better word, however, as Keating is truly an accomplished composer with the instruments of filmmaking. There is a precision in framing, color, lighting, parallel editing and even sound mixing that makes \u201cPsychopaths\u201d more digestible than its screenplay would suggest. Whatever the hell is happening on screen or whoever is being cut up or mutilated, the film is built\u00a0from dedication.\u00a0 But unless the ambition of \u201cPsychopaths\u201d is to motivate Michael Haneke to remake \u201cFunny Games\u201d for a second time, its efforts are gravely misplaced. The self-aware conceits of Keating\u2019s film get it nowhere, except farther away from having any major impact. At its\u00a0best, \u201cPsychopaths\u201d is an empty rebellion of a genre movie. At its worst, it\u2019s a confounding piece of shiny\u00a0trash."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Mommy", "Review": "Willfully over determined and perversely stylized, \u201cMommy,\u201d the fifth directorial feature from young filmmaker Xavier Dolan was certainly an attention-getter at last year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, where the jury obliged it to share a prize with Ye Olde Postmodernist Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s latest, \u201cGoodbye To Language.\u201d To paraphrase Public Enemy, in the case of Dolan\u2019s picture you might be well advised to look skeptically upon what is, to this critic\u2019s eye, a hype.\u00a0 The 25-year-old Dolan, a one-time child actor who cultivates a public persona equal parts prickly and smirkily smarmy, could be intuited as French-Canadian art cinema\u2019s answer to Justin Bieber even were he a press-avoiding recluse. It\u2019s in the work. Here, the story (such as it is) concerns a deeply troubled teen released into the custody of his abrasive, at-loose-ends single mom, after wreaking havoc in a juvenile detention center. (The movie begins with a text proviso recounting the passage of a [fictional] Canadian law allowing parents to have children committed at will, which is the sort of thing that academics call \u201cforeshadowing.\u201d) The mom, Diana, calls herself \u201cDie\u201d and has an overly festooned keychain and wears super-short skirts and wants to get work as a translator, but not of super-long work such as that of Ken Follett (don\u2019t look at me, that\u2019s what she says when talking herself up to a potential client). She\u2019s played with hardened integrity by Anne Dorval. Also excellent is Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment as Kyla, a neighbor of Diane who takes an interest in the welfare of her son.\u00a0 Advertisement Less good is Antoine-Olivier Pilon as Steve, the son. One can\u2019t be entirely sure whether it\u2019s Pilon\u2019s look-ma-no-control performance or the fact that Steve\u2019s not so much a character as a construction of tics and tropes. Angel-faced but never not mugging, not particularly intelligent but always capable of a razor-sharp comeback to a perceived slight, Steve is an ideal of the anti-social. One gets the feeling that Dolan finds him admirable somehow, which rubbed this critic very much the wrong way. To the extent that as the movie trudged on, whenever some misfortune befell the boy, I found myself reminded of the notorious reactionary conservative cartoonist Al Capp\u2019s observation that by his lights, \u201cEasy Rider\u201d had a happy ending. Although he has very little sense of structure or narrative, Dolan does have a noticeable technical facility, or perhaps the ability to hire, with the help of several national arts subsidies, crew members of technical facility, whom he uses to the fullest. The first minutes of the film are replete with nifty little color tricks, focus fripperies, and lens flares. The sound mix, too, is very \u201cHey!\u201d as when one song plays on the soundtrack (and yeah, I think it WAS Counting Crows) while other music leaks through Steve\u2019s headphones. The showoffiness extends to the movie\u2019s frame itself.\u00a0 For the most part, Dolan presents the film in a 1:1 aspect ratio, a perfect square (although tricks of the eye make it look more narrow a view than it actually presents). This is even more extreme in its boxiness than the old \u201cAcademy ratio\u201d most of us know from sound films of Hollywood up until the early 1950s. In theory this framing intends to trap the viewer into the hemmed-in dimensions of the characters\u2019 life options, and as such, one could argue that it serves that function well. However. Dolan breaks out of it twice: once during a montage in which Steve, Kaya, and Diane start to blossom in their affinities and affections; tooling along to \u201cWonderwall,\u201d Steve almost literally \u201copens\u201d the frame, willing the film into widescreen and letting the imagery breathe a bit. Why it\u2019s almost as if the \u201cSteve Effect\u201d the character jokingly spoke of earlier was real! Soon enough, circumstances intrude and the frame shrinks again.\u00a0 Advertisement The effect is of a corny but effective metaphor (and the montage itself is so full of \u201cmoments\u201d it suggests Dolan won\u2019t have any trouble at all adjusting to working in Hollywood once he gets there). It\u2019s with the second widening that Dolan shows his true hand, expanding the screen\u2019s dimensions for a dream sequence in which the actual Steve is replaced by what I\u2019ll call Hunky Steve, who\u2019s normal and loves his mom and gets married and gives mom a grandson, etc. Once Diane is shaken into waking, the box hems her in again, and the effect is actually sadistic: against Diane, and yes, against the audience. Dolan is not going to let you forget who\u2019s boss. As for myself, I quit."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Last Witch Hunter", "Review": "Many films try and fail to pull off the kind of densely over-plotted action-fantasy that director Breck Eisner (\"The Crazies,\" \"Sahara\") nails in \"The\u00a0Last Witch\u00a0Hunter.\" The secrets to Eisner's success are confidence and patience, both of which compensate for the film's script whenever it becomes embarrassingly thin (especially during its rushed finale). Still, if nothing else, \"The\u00a0Last Witch\u00a0Hunter\" is so much more adept than other recent convoluted post-\"The Matrix\" adventure films about a superhuman men-of-action (Vin Diesel, in this case) who see the world for what it really is, and are humanity's\u00a0last\u00a0hope of maintaining a peaceful status quo. While most other films sprint through expository dialogue, and bluster their way through action scenes, \"The\u00a0Last Witch\u00a0Hunter\" is measured enough to make you want to suspend your disbelief. Advertisement An especially charming Diesel plays Kaulder, a witch-slayer who was cursed to live forever by the\u00a0Witch\u00a0Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) back in ye olde viking days. An integral member of the mortal-led\u00a0witch-hunting organization Axe and Cross, Kaulder has grown full of himself after centuries of walking the Earth unchallenged. But when Ellic (Michael Caine), Kaulder's sidekick and the chronicler of his stories, dies on the day of his retirement, Kaulder investigates, and discovers a plot to revive the centuries-dead\u00a0Witch\u00a0Queen. Here's where \"The\u00a0Last\u00a0Witch\u00a0Hunter\" starts to get so dorky that you may want to give yourself a wedgie for enjoying it. In order to stop the\u00a0Witch\u00a0Queen, Kaulder must \"remember [his] death,\" a clue left for him by Ellic in smudged fingerprints all over one of Ellic's most prized books. The Rolodex of enemies and fair weather contacts that Kaulder meets up with on his rocky road to remembering is embarrassingly preposterous. Their ranks include Max Schlesinger (Isaach De Bankol\u00e9), a blind pastry chef-cum-magician who makes cupcakes out of\u00a0psychedelic moths, butterflies, and maggots, and Belilal (\u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson), a squat, curse-slinging warlock whose bushy beard and barrel chest makes him look like one of ZZ Top's touring bassists. What makes this scenario work are the periodic flashes of intelligence that prove that the film's trio of screenwriters\u00a0 thought about what motivates Kaulder. Diesel's usual cockiness suits his character. As he points out to Dolan the 37th (Elijah Wood), Ellic's successor at Axe and Cross, there's nothing he hasn't seen. Diesel is well-used in that sense, proving he's more than a blunt instrument in scenes where he huskily broods and sweet-talks his way around the film's most unwieldy exposition. Few action stars can convincingly mansplain their way through a scene where mystic rune stones that control the elements are used to stop and start a thunderstorm. Diesel is on the short list.\u00a0 Advertisement There are even fewer directors who are sensitive enough to sell scenes as conceptually all-over-the-map as the ones showcased here. But thanks to Eisner, there are blessedly few scenes in \"The\u00a0Last\u00a0Witch\u00a0Hunter\" that feel rushed (can we please get this guy to direct the upcoming \"Doctor Strange\" movie's sequel?). Romantic banter\u00a0 feels genuinely playful in scenes like when Kaulder and Chloe (Rose Leslie), a young\u00a0witch, flirt at Chloe's hookah bar. There aren't nearly enough scenes where Eisner can flex his muscles and prove that he's a stronger storyteller than the script with which he's working; the best is probably when Chloe comes home and silently tries to ward off a threatening spirit with an array of light bulbs. This scene teaches you how to watch it. No character has to explain that the bulbs' light is Chloe's only defense against whatever is threatening to invade her home. You just pick up that knowledge by watching Eisner work. Eisner's direction is similarly thoughtful during big special-effects-driven set pieces. He's a sturdy choreographer, and none of the big action scenes in \"The\u00a0Last\u00a0Witch\u00a0Hunter\" are as good as those from his surprisingly atmospheric, recent remake of George Romero's \"The Crazies.\" But flashbacks to Diesel's \"Dungeons and Dragons\"-worthy encounters with the\u00a0Witch\u00a0Queen and modern-day skirmishes with Belial do look good, and that's not just because of Eisner's keen eye for composition. \"The\u00a0Last\u00a0Witch\u00a0Hunter\" is just generally poised in ways that most fantasies should be, but aren't. There's breathing room in scenes where characters have to appear to be living with decisions they made a couple of scenes earlier. You know you're seeing an atypically dopey but consummately well-assembled fantasy when poor Michael Caine has to explain to viewers the\u00a0Witch\u00a0Queen's plan to spread a human-decimating plague using the various witches\u00a0that Kaulder locked up over the years in the Axe and Cross's \"witch\u00a0prison.\" \"The\u00a0Last\u00a0Witch\u00a0Hunter\" may be corny at heart, but it's cool enough to convince you otherwise while its creators sell you a story you've seen some iteration of many, many times before."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Contracted: Phase II", "Review": "Pointless body horror sequel \"Contracted: Phase II\" doesn't develop its predecessor's concepts so much as it resolves all of the questions you never needed answered. It also follows all of the supporting characters from the first film that you you never needed to learn more about. Picking up where \"Contracted\" left off, \"Phase II\" begins with the violent death of Samantha (Najarra Townsend), a sexually-active young woman who suffers from a body-mulching virus that turns her into a rapidly putrefying woman-shaped meat-bag. \"Phase II\" follows the spread of Samantha's disease without delving into the knotty themes of sex-negativity and slut-shaming that the first film tackles with admirable confidence. One-note characters suffer the same symptoms that Samantha did in the last film, but never at the same length, nor the same kinds of psychological hang-ups. Beyond some effectively icky make-up effects, \"Contracted: Phase II\" sells nothing that viewers absolutely must buy. Advertisement While \"Contracted\" is an intimate character study, \"Contracted: Phase II\" aimlessly follows multiple characters. But of the film's ensemble cast, milquetoast beta-male Riley (Matt Mercer) is the film's clear lead. In \"Contracted,\" Riley was a frustrated \"nice guy.\" Which is to say: Riley, a shallow, shy young man who won't take \"No\" for an answer, chases after Samantha, a sensitive, questioning young woman who warily identifies as a lesbian, until she gives into her disease's symptomatic sex-lust and has relations with Riley. But in \"Contracted: Phase II,\" Riley is just a frustrated victim who becomes an gun-wielding avenger once he sets out to kill B.J. (Morgan Peter Brown), the man responsible for giving Samantha her unidentifiable super-disease. Riley's unconvincing transformation into a vengeance-seeking alpha-male is disappointing because Riley isn't much of a character to begin with. When we first rejoin him, Riley is getting tested for STDs. He's told point-blank by his sister's husband that men have a lower chance of catching STDs than women do. But because the double standard between how men and women's promiscuity is respectively treated is an interesting angle, the makers of \"Phase II\" do not choose to pursue it. Instead, they divide their time between mocking the vanity of Riley's pregnant, self-help-book-writing sister Brenda (Laurel Vale), and explaining B.J.'s background through cypher detective Crystal's (Marianna Palka) investigation. While that's going on, Riley's grandma Margie (Suzanne Voss) and Margie's care-giver Harper (Anna Lore) struggle to come to the plot's foreground. They never make it, and are ultimately treated like accessories to Riley's self-actualizing quest, as we are lead to anticipate in an early scene where Margie tells Riley to \"[not] be a pussy\" and drink the glass of whiskey she offers him. Tantalizing details like that--when's the last time an older woman was allowed to drink without her taste for alcohol becoming the puchline to a dumb joke--are what makes \"Phase II\" such a chore. Following a myriad characters in the vain hopes of impressing viewers' with the scope of the original \"Contracted\" just doesn't cut it when our focus is on B.J.'s generic serial killer, and Riley's testy but equally forgettable would-be hero. Riley only comes to life whenever he's picking at various little wounds all over his body. These scenes are filmed so effectively that viewers will feel vicariously relieved, particularly when Riley applies rubbing alcohol or surgical forceps to marks that eventually cover his entire body. One can't help but think admiringly of the body horror films of David Cronenberg, particularly \"The Fly,\" during these scenes since they make viewers simultaneously wonder and repulsed at the discovery of new scabs, lesions, and other corporeal imperfections. Advertisement But once you start thinking of Cronenberg's monsters, one can't help but unfavorably compare \"Phase II\" to the first \"Contracted.\" \"Contracted\" not only features more, but better gross-out body horror scenes. \"Contracted\" also has the knack for bratty provocation that will make viewers talk about and most likely violently disagree on the film's sexual politics. That knack for button-pushing is also reminiscent of Cronenberg's films, specifically early features like \"Shivers\" and \"Rabid.\" Like those juvenile-but-satisfying films, \"Contracted\" gets viewers to see Samantha as a product of an inherently messed-up environment, one whose fixation and understanding of sex is inherently warped. \"Contracted: Phase II\" eschews that level of smart-ass nuance, and instead offers a cluttered horror-thriller about a guy with a bad infection, and a worse attitude."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Beirut", "Review": "In the opening scenes of \u201cBeirut,\u201d the suave Mason Skiles (Jon Hamm) describes the location that also gives Brad Anderson\u2019s new film a title as a \u201cboarding house without a landlord.\u201d This kind of dismissive chatter about a tumultuous part of the world is likely going to inflame the recent controversy about the perception that \u201cBeirut\u201d is just another film that uses the Middle East for backdrops and bad guys. (And the fact that it filmed in Morocco and not Lebanon didn\u2019t help that controversy.) So, the first question in your mind may be to the validity of these complaints. Yes, it\u2019s true that the trailer doesn\u2019t come close to capturing the intricacies of the plot here, one of those classic Tony Gilroy contraptions in which the American characters, especially those hiding under government orders, are complicit and arguably more truly evil than the people on the ground. And the fact that this is a period piece helps explain the change of filming venue as Beirut 35 years ago looked nothing like it looks today. However, it\u2019s difficult to shake the sense that some of what\u2019s happening here is that classic Middle Eastern villainous set dressing\u2014bearded men, lit in shadows, with generic Arabic music playing in the background. Mason calls it a boarding house, but \u201cBeirut\u201d seems remarkably uninterested in the actual cultural identity of the people who live there. However, that may be part of the point. Advertisement To enjoy \u201cBeirut,\u201d one needs to look at it less as an examination of a place and more as a vehicle for a star. After the award-winning success of \u201cMad Men,\u201d the world kept waiting for filmmakers to translate Jon Hamm\u2019s star power to the big screen \u2026 and it never really happened. He\u2019s been great in supporting roles in films like \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d but a lead role that took advantage of his charisma never really came. On paper, Tony Gilroy seems like the perfect writer for Jon Hamm. Gilroy loves handsome men forced into morally gray areas, writing such roles for George Clooney (\u201cMichael Clayton\u201d), Clive Owen (\u201cDuplicity\u201d), and Matt Damon (he wrote the original Bourne trilogy). He\u2019s a great writer when it comes to dismantling traditional star power, and Hamm fits that model perfectly. As such, this is Hamm\u2019s best leading role to date, a reminder of how good he can be when he\u2019s given the right material.    Hamm plays Mason, who we meet in 1972 as a happy U.S. diplomat just before the worst night of his life. A friend and colleague of Mason\u2019s named Cal (Mark Pellegrino) comes to him and gives him shattering news\u2014their 13-year-old ward Karim is the younger brother of a known terrorist, the man responsible for orchestrating the Munich Olympics attack, and there\u2019s reason to believe that Karim has been in contact with his sibling. As Mason is trying to negotiate a peaceful way to extricate Karim safely and not disrupt his party or his family, Karim\u2019s brother\u2019s people show up and everything goes to hell. Karim is taken; Mason's wife is shot. Cut to roughly ten years later\u2014Mason is an alcoholic, working labor disputes in Boston, when he\u2019s contacted and told that he\u2019s needed in Beirut. If the city was on the verge of chaos in 1972, it is a ruinous nightmare in the early \u201880s, torn at the seams by everyone in the area who seeks to control it, including both the PLO and the Israelis. Against this backdrop of crisis, Mason is informed that Cal has been kidnapped, and now-grown Karim (Idir Chender) is the man responsible. Mason encounters a trio of U.S. suited goons who order him around and scream \u201cdon\u2019t trust that guy\u201d from the minute they show up\u2014Dean Norris, Shea Wigham, and Larry Pine\u2014and is given a more-trustworthy confidant in a CIA handler played by the great Rosamund Pike.    Advertisement It\u2019s incredibly clich\u00e9d at this point, but \u201cBeirut\u201d really is the kind of movie they don\u2019t make anymore. Films of international diplomacy and political gamesmanship in the Middle East aren\u2019t exactly profitable, and television has become the new home for such storytelling. Heck, even Jack Ryan is going to TV. And so there\u2019s something refreshing about seeing a film clearly made for adults instead of the teen-driven fare that dominates the market. I\u2019m hopeful that the mid-budget movie for grown-ups doesn\u2019t die (or just go to Netflix)\u2014although I\u2019m worried that it almost certainly will. And so there\u2019s something invigorating about seeing a movie that reminds me of the political thrillers of the \u201870s and \u201880s, the kind of movie we see less and less of at the multiplex.    And there are times when \u201cBeirut\u201d really works like the films that clearly inspired it. Hamm\u2019s best arcs on \u201cMad Men\u201d were arguably when Don Draper was at his most self-destructively low, and he finds a bit of those rhythms in Mason Skiles, a man destroyed by unimaginable trauma and then asked to come back and dig through that trauma to avoid an international crisis. His body language never overplays the world-weary aspect of his character\u2014he doesn\u2019t just look tired like some actors do when asked to play alcoholic or traumatized. It\u2019s something subtler, something in his eyes that indicates he has thought about giving up entirely, maybe as recently as yesterday. And the supporting cast here is uniformly strong. Pike, Wigham and Norris are always welcome cast additions. Gilroy's script also carefully refuses to call attention to itself, it's zippy without being overly self-aware. In the end, it\u2019s fair to say that \u201cBeirut\u201d treats its setting a bit two-dimensionally, but I think Gilroy and the consistently-strong director Brad Anderson would say that this treatment is part of the point. The Beirut of \u201cBeirut\u201d is a battlefield, a place where people fight to maintain control for a region of the country largely because of where it\u2019s located and not because of the people who live there or the history they hold. It makes some sense that the city itself would be a bit of a cipher to the characters of \u201cBeirut\u201d\u2014they don\u2019t care about the people there as much as what they can do for them.

Indeed, so doth Capt. Jack Sparrow's, as he obtains two chalices to use while drinking from the Fountain of Youth and seeks a mermaid's tears to invest them with magic. There's always a Catch-22. You fight Spanish conquistadors and the British navy to find the bloody fountain, and now you need a weepy mermaid. Advertisement I had fleeting hopes for this episode of the Disney franchise. An opening sequence is fun, as Captain Jack impersonates a British judge, is chased through London,and discovers his old amour, Angelica (Penelope Cruz) attempting to impersonate him while raising the crew for a ship. That anyone would still want to sail under Jack's command is a tribute to the daring of British seamen. The movie is fun until they set sail. Johnny Depp, who confesses he's rather tired of playing his relentless hero, nevertheless does a plucky job here. He plays Jack Sparrow as an insouciant wise guy, rarely ruffled, always ready with a quip. Whether he is a competent swashbuckler is hard to say, because the fight sequences here are composed in the editing and do not seem to exist in an actual space-time continuum. We no longer see truly great sword-fighting, the kind performed by Liam Neeson and Tim Roth in \"Rob Roy\" (1995). It's all impossible leaping and incomprehensible cutting, giving us all of the movement of action and none of the excitement. The best way to describe the plot is by explaining that the Fountain of Youth is the MacGuffin. Angelica and Jack set sail for the new world aboard a ship commanded by Blackbeard (Ian McShane), who is said to be her father. The ship's crew includes zombies, which is a step up from previous crew members in the series, skeletons. Blackbeard is in a race to find the fountain before Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who is being financed by King George, who needs to drink from the fountain none too soon. Rush is as always a dependable actor, but his sandpapery complexion is rather alarming here. Get this sailor some Lubriderm. Also in the race is a boatload of Spanish sailors, sent by their king. All three boats pitch up on the same beach and fight each other to the fountain. But wait. The mermaids. Yes, a special reflector used in an old lighthouse casts light on one of the longboats, and light attracts mermaids, and it's a nasty sight. We get to meet only one of the mermaids, the well-named Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), comely and doe-eyed, with one of those official hairdos that cleverly conceals the delightful bits. Advertisement Syrena and Philip (Sam Claflin), a cleric, lock eyes and hearts. But Syrena is needed for her tears and is held captive and transported through the jungle in a large water tank, wherein she nearly drowns because she cannot breathe, establishing at last what I have always argued \u2014 that mermaids are amphibians.  One improvement this time is the dropping of the superfluous non-pirate characters played earlier by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. I was never sure what essential function they fulfilled; Depp and Cruz are so over the top, they function as their own supporting characters. Even in his first \"Pirates\" movie, Depp seemed to be channeling large parts of the persona of Keith Richards, not to mention all of the eyeliner. As in the last sequel, the Rolling Stone himself turns up again, playing Jack Sparrow's father. The hairdressers for these two characters seem to have involved themselves in some sort of a grudge bet. \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\" is about what you'd expect. It is long, expensive and bombastic, and the beautiful mermaid has a tantalizing way of not coming quite far enough out of the water. For me, it's too much of a muchness. The whole series was inspired by a ride at Disneyland. There's a bright side to that. At least no movie has yet been inspired by \"It's a Small World.\""}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Somewhere Between", "Review": "Four girls: each abandoned, each eventually adopted by an American family. Now they are teenagers in American suburbs, a world of minivans and school activities. Each is clearly confident enough to navigate her local terrain. Each is introspective about her roots, curious about her origins, though perhaps not so confident about meeting her birth family, should that possibility arise. The movie explores the psychology of being immigrant in American society. The young women have that consciousness that minority status in America forces. Immigrants are simultaneously insiders and outsiders, always conscious of our identities. The sense of exile from all lands, living somewhere between this and that, is the norm. Many immigrants respond by trying to surrender everything that would be deemed \u201cexotic,\u201d whether it means overcompensation with language, makeup, or even surgery. These girls, however, seem exceptionally comfortable in their own skins. I suspect much of that has to do with the fact that their experience is an exponentially exaggerated version of the common immigrant experience. But, I suspect that just as much results from their adoptive parents' concerns in raising them. One mother learned Chinese, while all the parents seem to take their adoptive daughters back to China, almost annually. Advertisement If there is overcompensation, it is in social, academic, and (probably) professional endeavors, often in response to their early abandonment. These girls speculate about why they were given up, suspecting their biological families were poor, but the most prevelent reason for them is simply that they are girls. At this point, the film could have turned political, turning into a typical celebration of selected American freedoms against selected Chinese human-rights atrocities. The film occasionally edges in that direction, but thankfully stops short. Rather, we are seeing real people and their real experiences, and while global politics definitely plays a role, it is secondary to the realities they face. Their stories are painful, yet shared with a somber acceptance. One girl was taken on a bus ride and told to wait for a cousin who never appeared. Another was left by her mother in a neighboring village; when the father went to look for her, she was already lost. We see birthday parties, but because these girls were abandoned, we do not know their real birthdays. In response, they feel the need to prove themselves, especially as females. I suspect that this combination of immigrant consciousness and personal need will provide them with tremendous strength and advantage in later years -- assuming that the're able to resolve some internal conflicts. There are two especially moving threads. During one interview, a subject breaks into tears as she speaks about her difficulties with that word, \u201cabandonment.\u201d The question mark that adoptees often have, wondering why their biological parents left them, finds a soothing ointment in the gushing love from their adoptive families. Here, however, we speak of an abandonment for unknown reasons by an unknown family from an unknown village on the other side of the globe. So, the question remains unanswered. Advertisement In the other story, we follow a girl down the trail toward possibly finding her biological father. Some girls are told they look like the people of this or that ethnic group, without much consistency. In this case, however, we meet a woman who suspects she recognizes a girl as, perhaps, her niece. We meet the man who might be her father, and they take DNA tests. Problems in mail delivery and conscious choices in film editing keep us in suspense. Interestingly, in some of these families, these young women are not the only adoptees in their households. Even though we enter the lives of four girls, there are so many interwoven storylines that it is sometimes difficult to keep track of them all. But that might be the filmmaker's point. We're talking about four girls, but we are also seeing something much larger, a growing transcontinental subculture. Watching this movie, I feel the need to run to the mall or someplace, and find a Chinese baby to hug. Or, at least, I can hug my own daughters."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Dear John", "Review": "Lasse Hallstrom's \"Dear John\" tells the heartbreaking story of two lovely young people who fail to find happiness together because they're trapped in an adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel. Their romance leads to bittersweet loss that's so softened by the sweet characters that it feels like triumph. If a Sparks story ended in happiness, the characters might be disappointed. They seem to have their noble, resigned dialogue already written. Hemingway wrote one line that could substitute for the third act of every Sparks story: \"Isn't it pretty to think so?\" Advertisement Channing Tatum stars as John Tyree, a handsome Army Special Forces specialist home on two weeks' leave at the South Carolina shore. Amanda Seyfried plays Savannah, an ethereal beauty whose purse falls off a pier. John dives in and retrieves it, and we guess it could have been worse. He could have gotten her kitten down from a tree. In the few precious days they share, they fall deeply into PG-13 love.  John was raised by his father (Richard Jenkins), a quiet man who wears white gloves while admiring his coin collection, and cooks chicken every Saturday and lasagna every Sunday. Savannah meets him and casually observes to John that he is autistic -- a mild case, she gently suggests.  John is angered by this observation. Did he never, by the age of 22, observe that his father was strangely mannered? Did no one else? What was his (now absent) mother's thinking? Did the movie mention any employment history for Mr. Tyree? I could have missed it.  In a Sparks story, as we know from \"The Notebook,\" problems like autism and Alzheimer's are never seen in their tragic stages, but always allow the good souls of their victims to visibly glow. Diseases don't destroy and kill, but exist primarily to inspire admirable conduct by nexts of kin. John and Savannah get over his unhappiness, and he pledges that he'll be back at the end of 12 months so they can wed. But then 9/11 happens, and like every man in his group, John re-enlists. And continues to re-enlist, until the movie's title hints at what he receives in the mail. Because Savannah is a true-blue heroine, her new love is of course a nice and decent man, someone who John can accept, so that we can smile sadly and not get all messy and depressed.  That's the note Sparks aims for: the sad smile. First love is not to be, but the moon still looks so large when it rises, and people treat each other gently, and if someone should die, that is very sad, but perhaps it will provide an opportunity for someone else to live a little longer before they, too, must travel to that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler ever returns. Advertisement John and Savannah are awfully nice. She comes from a rich family who have a mansion, and John and his dad live in a humble but cozy frame house that in its South Carolina island location might easily be purchased for less than $500,000. That would leave a portion of Mr. Tyree's unspecified income free to invest in rare coins and amass a collection worth a fortune. I am just enough of a numismatist to know that you need to invest money in order to collect rare coins. You don't just find them in your spare change. I know I'm being snarky. I don't get much pleasure from it. \"Dear John\" exists only to coddle the sentiments of undemanding dreamers, and plunge us into a world where the only evil is the interruption of the good. Of course John is overseas on a series of missions so secret that Savannah cannot be told where, exactly, he is. In the years after 9/11, where, oh where, could he be? Apparently not in Iraq or Afghanistan, because it can hardly be a military secret that the men of Special Forces are deployed there. But somewhere, anyway, and he re-enlists for a good chunk of her early childbearing years, perhaps because, as \"The Hurt Locker\" informs us, \"war is a drug.\"  It matters not. In this movie, war is a plot device. It loosens its grip on John only long enough to sporadically renew his romance, before claiming him again so that we finally consider Savannah's Dear John letter just good common sense. Now that I've brought that up: considering that the term \"Dear John letter\" has been in constant use since World War II, and that the hero of this movie is inevitably destined to receive such a letter, is it a little precious of Sparks to name him \"John\"? I was taught in Dan Curley's fiction class that when the title of a story is cited in the story itself, the story's spell is broken. But then Sparks never took Curley's class. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "P2", "Review": "If you have seen the ads for \"P2,\" or even heard about them, you know what the movie involves. A woman works late in the office on Christmas Eve, leaves after everyone else, descends to parking level P2 to get her car, finds it won't start and then meets the homicidal madman who is the overnight lot attendant. Yes, I know, it sounds like a formula slasher film, but it's actually done well, and in the current climate at least most Women in Danger films end up with Men in Danger. Elements of \"P2\" even reminded me a little of Jodie Foster's \"Panic Room\" -- especially in complexities involving cell phones, alarms, spycams, and doors that are locked or unlocked. Advertisement The movie benefits from being played about as straight as it can be, given the material. Rachel Nichols, as the endangered heroine Angela, doesn't do stupid things or make obvious mistakes. And Wes Bentley, as the lonely guy on overnight duty, doesn't froth at the mouth and cackle with insane zeal. Oh, he's insane, all right, but he's one of those insane Lonely Guys who can't understand why Angela doesn't want to share his Christmas dinner (turkey and trimmings, and even corn muffins!), even though he has stripped her to her lingerie, chained her to the furniture and has a savage dog lunging at her. He's just trying to be friends. A movie like this depends on invention in the screenplay. You can't merely have the woman running around frantically while the guy pops up in the foreground with a standard horror movie swooshing sound. There has to be a little logic. And Angela thinks of most of the right things to do, even though most of the time she can't do them. In today's high-security climate, if you're locked in, you're locked in. One day when we have more time, I'll tell you about when I went for a winter stroll in London's Hyde Park and didn't know the gates were locked at 6, and how it started snowing while I was trying to climb a slushy hill to get to a tree branch that I thought might allow me to drop over a 6-foot fence topped with sharp spikes, and how when I balanced on the tree and called for help to passers-by, they walked a little faster. It's that kind of an evening for Angela. She does everything right, but it doesn't work. And when she somehow gets out a garbled call for help on 911, two cops turn up and they do everything right, too. Often in thrillers, the cops are practically standing on a dead body and don't notice anything. But these guys are pros, they follow the ropes, they don't take Thomas' story at face value, and still they don't save Angela. It's a lot more exciting that way. This is, in case you haven't noticed, the best autumn for movies in years. There are a dozen, maybe two dozen, movies in current release that I would recommend over \"P2.\" Maybe four dozen. Maybe three dozen. But horror movies routinely \"win the weekend\" at the box office, and it is no small consolation that the customers who insist on their horror movie this weekend will see a well-made one. It's such a good season that even the slashers are superior. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Hello, My Name Is Doris", "Review": "For those of us who really liked\u2014nay, worshipped and adored\u2014Sally Field even before she won a single Oscar, her presence in the modestly conceived but emotionally brimming \u201cHello, My Name is Doris\u201d is like a beacon of beckoning human warmth just waiting to be cherished. The 69-year-old actress and former TV \u201cGidget\u201d not only gets to prove that her superb comedic skills have gotten none the rustier since she was last given a worthy arena to display them. But the fact that Field is doing so in her first leading role in 20 years is on the same level of a cinematic event as Lily Tomlin\u2019s hardcore domination of \u201cGrandma\u201d or Blythe Danner's delicate command of \u201cI\u2019ll See You in My Dreams.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement It\u2019s not that much of an exaggeration to say that her Doris\u2014a 60-ish, never-wed office drone whose sheltered life spent on Staten Island with a fat, lazy cat, a demanding invalid mother and decades of hoarded clutter\u2014is a somewhat spikier but no less sweeter invention in the mode of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Little Tramp. She even dresses the part in what used to be Salvation Army toss-offs but have since been reclaimed in this age of shabby-chic as vintage wear. We laugh at her foibles, applaud her small victories, agonize over her questionable choices, share her growth pains and allow her to tug on our heartstrings. In a society that too often devalues its older citizenry, Doris\u2019 arrival is as welcome as the first crocus of spring. If this low-budget indie directed by Michael Showalter, who shares writing credit with Laura Terruso, is somewhat shakier in its plotting than Field is with her choices onscreen, it matters little considering that basically she is the movie. Not that there aren\u2019t a parade of talented younger faces in the cast, most likely eager to share space with the film\u2019s star, including Kumail Nanjiani (\u201cSilicon Valley\u201d), Rich Sommer (\u201cMad Men\u201d), Natasha Lyonne (\u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d) and Beth Behrs (\u201c2 Broke Girls\u201d). Neither does it suffer from being a sort of gender-inverted version of the glossier and ultimately shallower \u201cThe Intern\u201d with Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. While De Niro enhanced his mainstream material by putting aside his usual short-fuse persona to become a gentlemanly fount of wisdom, \u201cHello, My Name is Doris\u201d has a welcome rawness that partly derives from making do with fewer resources.\u00a0 The perennially youthful Field\u2019s defiance of stereotypes starts early as she experiences a coming of age and a late-life crisis simultaneously. The film opens with her mother\u2019s funeral, an initially anxiety-inducing event that soon allows Doris to embrace new opportunities, aided by a talk given by a self-help guru (Peter Gallagher in a cameo, offering such cheesy advice as reading \u201cimpossible\u201d as \u201cI\u2019m possible\u201d). They soon arrive in the form of John Fremont (Max Greenfield, in a refreshingly kinder and engaging change of pace from his Schmidt on TV\u2019s \u201cNew Girl\u201d), her company\u2019s new art director who's about half her age. While forced together in a crowded elevator, a smiling John innocently tells Doris that he likes her fancy cat-eyed specs. That is all it takes to zing her romantic strings and spark a sexual awakening. Advertisement Her ploys to entice the unaware John at work fall flat, so she turns to the 13-year-old granddaughter of her outspoken pal Roz (an invaluable Tyne Daly), who helps her create a fake Facebook page so she can virtually stalk him. Doris learns John likes an electro-pop band named Baby Goya and the Nuclear Winters and arranges to attend a concert at a Williamsburg club with him. With her neon yellow coveralls, tacky Vegas visor, messy \u201860s beehive and unfiltered reactions prove to be a hit with the millennial crowd, who adopt her as a kind of mascot. Baby Goya himself (Jack Antonoff of the band fun.) beckons her backstage, pronounces her \u201ccool\u201d and asks her to pose for his next album cover. This is a narrative stretch, of course, but it is a pleasure to watch. Alas, it turns out John has a girlfriend, a turn of events that causes Doris to resort to misguided measures. Field knows how to milk such scenes as when Doris tricks John into re-inflating the exercise ball she is forced to sit upon at her desk for a quick thrill or when she bounces around like a giddy dervish to her first exposure to electronica music. But she truly excels at digging deeper, such as the quieter moment when she tells John about how her long-ago engagement that failed to lead to marriage or the long-gestating outburst where she blasts her selfish brother and shrewish sister-in-law (Stephen Root and Wendi McLendon-Covey, both terrific) for taking advantage of her. Some might dismiss this tale of a blooming wallflower as simply a manipulative twee fantasy. But for those of us who trust in Field, this film will have us at \u201cHello.\u201d"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Jane Wants a Boyfriend", "Review": "These days, there are a fair amount of films and TV shows that depict the difficulties of people who cope with the sometimes isolating aspects of autism, especially when it comes to romantic relationships. \u201cRain Man\u201d might have started the trickle of such often hyper-smart yet socially challenged characters into mainstream entertainment, but sitcoms such as \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d (whose star Jim Parsons supports fan theories that his Sheldon has Asperger\u2019s, a form of autism) and \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d (cast member T.J. Miller has described it as an \u201cAsperger\u2019s \u2018Entourage\u2019 \u201c) as well as movies including \u201cThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network\u201d have carried on the trend with some regularity.\u00a0 Advertisement Into the fray arrives \u201cJane\u00a0Wants a Boyfriend,\u201d a sweetly-intentioned though somewhat awkwardly structured spin on a Hallmark Channel-style dramedy that strives to shed light on the disorder from a female perspective. It is clearly filled with good intentions, with a script inspired by real-life events and a reliance on rehearsals for a theatrical production of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d to add thematic texture. Producer Kerry Magro, who has autism, was called upon to ensure there would be an honest portrayal of\u00a0Jane\u00a0as she struggles with matters of the heart. Happily, Louisa Krause (who had supporting roles in \u201cYoung Adult\u201d and \u201cMartha Marcy May Marlene\u201d) strikes a satisfying balance as\u00a0Jane\u00a0by being both winsomely free-spirited and wildly creative but also prone to explosive meltdowns and an inability to focus on detailed tasks while under pressure. Whether she is naughtily downing a margarita for the first time or miming the dialogue to the cult \u201850s crime-noir \u201cKansas City Confidential\u201d (everything she knows about love, we are told, comes from old movies), Krause\u2014who is reminiscent of a young Catherine O\u2019Hara\u2014is a pleasure to observe even during\u00a0Jane\u2019s more difficult moments.\u00a0 Alas, any stereotyping to be had is found on the other side of this tale of two sisters. As Bianca, a waitress turned legit actress after landing the plum role of Titania\u2014the Bard\u2019s queen of the fairies who is besotted with donkey-headed Bottom (played by \u201cJane\u201d screenwriter Jarret Kerr)\u2014Eliza Dushku can\u2019t help but initially command our attention. After all, this breakout alum of the Joss Whedon academy of cult TV hits (\u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d \u201cAngel\u201d and \u201cDollhouse\u201d) is not only as striking as ever, but also is one of the few recognizable faces onscreen.\u00a0 But her Bianca quickly becomes more of a cardboard convenience than a fleshed-out human on many levels. For one, she and future husband Rob (Amir Arison) can somehow afford to move into rather spacious digs (her closet alone could almost pass as a studio rental) in a Manhattan-adjacent location. It only gets worse when we learn they are serving a $100 bottle of wine at Bianca\u2019s farewell-to-waitressing party. Rob also is lucky enough to be the rare journalist to get a promotion instead of an email announcing another round of layoffs. As for the running bit about Bianca\u2019s need to sneak off to smoke cigarettes, it goes stale pretty fast as did my interest in these characters. Advertisement On top of that, Bianca is the very textbook definition of a control freak. Her uptight nature not only affects her onstage performance but also alienates her from\u00a0Jane\u00a0as she refuses to treat her sister as an adult and allow her to make her own decisions. That their flighty mom (Polly Draper of \u201cthirtysomething\u201d fame) thinks nothing of using the occasion of\u00a0Jane\u2019s 25th\u00a0birthday to deliver the news that she and their father are moving to rural New Jersey, and that they expect Jane\u00a0to move in with Bianca, only complicates matters. Yes, Bianca was kind enough to get\u00a0Jane\u00a0an internship as a costuming assistant for the play, but she and Rob go a step too far when Jack (Gabriel Ebert), the somewhat emotionally stunted sous chef from her restaurant who is yearning for commitment himself, becomes attracted to\u00a0Jane\u00a0without suspecting she is autistic. He just knows that she is a refreshing upgrade from the hard-partying college girls he has been dating and thinks she is \u201cpretty cool.\u201d When Bianca realizes what is happening, she tells Jack to back off while Rob initially refuses to give him\u00a0Jane\u2019s number, with the decidedly non-PC warning that she\u2019s \u201cretarded.\u201d At this point, there is more to worry about Bianca and Rob\u2019s wrongheaded attempts at protecting\u00a0Jane\u00a0than anything else. Besides, as her suitor, Ebert (a Tony-winner for his work in \u201cMatilda the Musical\u201d) does a fine job of evolving from potential jerk to perfect match in just a few scenes while believably bringing out the best in Krause\u2019s\u00a0Jane. As Shakespeare wrote, \u201cThe course of true love never did run true,\u201d especially when the would-be top chef launches into an extended first-date metaphor involving recipes for \u201celusive soups.\u201d But soon enough, the course of true love runs very true. Predictably, yes, but pleasantly enough, as\u00a0Jane\u00a0gets what she wants\u2014and deserves. \u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Secret of Kells", "Review": "When I went to Ireland to visit the set of \"Ryan's Daughter,\" the studio sent a car to ferry me and my cohort McHugh to the Dingle Peninsula. As we drove along, we crossed an old bridge and the driver said, \"Leprechauns made their home under this bridge.\" We stopped for petrol, and I quietly said to McHugh, \"He doesn't know you're Irish and is giving us the tourist treatment.\" \"Ebert,\" said McHugh, \"he means it.\"  Did he mean it? Did McHugh believe that he meant it? With the Irish, the answer is yes and no. McHugh and his brothers told me how as lads they picked up change by discovering the Irish surnames of Yankee tourists and offering to show them where their ancestors lived. They always led them to the same shop in a little cottage, where the owner gave them a \"consideration\" for any purchases made. Advertisement What does this possibly have to do with \"The Secret of Kells,\" one of this year's Oscar nominees for best animated feature? Quite a bit, I think. Here is a film about a young and very brave medieval monk named Brendan, a sacred book, a storied monastery, a fairy girl, an alarming creature and a forest containing little nuts that make brilliant green inks. The fairy girl is quite real, as Brendan can see for himself. If there are any leprechauns, she no doubt knows them. If there are not, how does she know for sure? The Irish are a verbal people, preserving legends in story and song; few Chicagoans may know there's a First Folio of Shakespeare in the Newberry Library, but few Dubliners do not know that the Book of Kells reposes in Trinity College. I viewed it once. It is a painstakingly illuminated medieval manuscript preserving the four gospels, and every page is a work of art. Many monks created it over many years. Perhaps little Brendan was one of them. Perhaps some of that brilliant emerald green was his, extracted from nuts he gathered in the forest. Brendan (voice of Evan McGuire), the youngest and pluckiest monk in the walled monastery, befriends old Brother Aidan (Mick Lally), a traveler who has arrived bearing the precious book. Some pages remain to be created, and Aidan says Brendan must help. He can start by disobeying the Abbot (Brendan Gleeson), venturing outside the walls, and gathering the nuts. This and his further adventures are related in Tomm Moore's film, which is a little like an illuminated manuscript itself. Just as every margin of the Book of Kells is crowded with minute and glorious decorations, so is every shot of the film filled with patterns and borders, arches and frames, do-dads and scrimshaw images. The colors are bold and bright; the drawings are simplified and 2-D. That reflects the creation of the original book in the centuries before the discovery of perspective duringn the Renaissance.  Advertisement Like the people in Nina Paley's \"Sita Sings the Blues,\" these images move mostly from back and forth within the same plane, which is only correct since perspective hasn't yet created spatial dimension. But there's no feeling of limitation. Indeed, in a season where animated images hurl themselves from the screen with alarming recklessness, I was grateful that these were content merely to be admired. The movie has a wide appeal, with a gap in the middle. I think it will appeal to children young enough to be untutored in boredom, and to anyone old enough to be drawn in, or to appreciate the artistry. For those in between, the \"Transformers\"-damaged generation, it will seem to be composed in a quaint, unknown language."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Good Dinosaur", "Review": "Over the\r\ncourse of their first fifteen features, Pixar has made some great films (such\r\nas the \"Toy Story\" series, \"Ratatouille\" and \"Inside\r\nOut\") and some not-so-great ones (such as anything with the word\r\n\"Cars\" in the title). However, the best of them are the ones that intrigue an initial idea and elaborate upon it with the kind\r\nof well-developed characters, ingenious plots and emotional resonance that is\r\nrarely seen in films aimed at\r\nfamily audiences. The problem with their latest effort, \"The Good\r\nDinosaur,\" is that it has the intriguing initial idea but then seems\r\ncuriously unsure of how to pursue it. The end result is a film that has some\r\npromising elements and which often seems as if it is on the verge of evolving\r\ninto something wonderful but never quite manages to turn that particular\r\ncorner. Advertisement The basic\r\nconceit of the film is undeniably promising\u2014what might have happened if the\r\nasteroid that hit Earth 65 million years ago actually missed its target, and the\r\ndinosaurs that were rendered extinct by its impact were able to continue to\r\nthrive and evolve as a species? After a brief prologue showing that near-miss,\r\nthe film jumps ahead a few million years to focus on a family of apatosaurus\r\ntending to their farm. Alas, the youngest of the bunch, the runty Arlo (voiced\r\nby Raymond Ochoa) is unable to do much and is the butt of teasing from older siblings\r\nBuck (Marcus Scribner) and Libby (Maleah Padilla), while his father (Jeffrey\r\nWright) and mother (Frances McDormand) try to assure him that he is destined\r\nfor greatness. One day, while chasing a feral child (Jack Bright) who has been\r\nstealing their crops, the fearful Arlo and his father are caught in a raging\r\nrainstorm and parents of more sensitive children better have the Kleenex\r\nready. While\r\nstruggling to help his mother bring their crops in before winter arrives, Arlo\r\nruns across that same child, who he blames for the death of his father, and\r\nwhile pursuing him, the two fall into the river and are swept many miles down\r\nbefore washing ashore. At first, Arlo hates the kid but the boy, who not only\r\nacts like a dog but soon responds to the name Spot, eventually grows on him and\r\nthe two become friends as they discover they have more in common than one might\r\nthink. As Arlo and Spot begin the long and perilous journey upstream to Arlo's\r\nhome, they encounter such dangers as a giant cobra and a trio of pterodactyls\r\n(whose leader is voiced by Steve Zahn) whose seemingly laid-back attitude\r\nstands in marked contrast to their desire to savage anything they can get their\r\ntalons on. Somewhat friendlier are a trio of T-Rexes (with the voices of Sam\r\nElliott, Anna Paquin and A.J. Buckley) who are, oddly enough, buffalo ranchers\r\ntrying to rescue their herd from some rustling raptors.\u00a0  There are\r\nsome good ideas in Meg LeFauve's screenplay, such as the idea of inverting the\r\nclassic boy-and-his-pet narrative so that the boy is the pet, and the way that\r\nit threatens to become a full-blown Western with the introduction of the\r\nT-Rexes (including a campfire scene complete with someone playing a mournful\r\ntune on a \"harmonica\"). But once it introduces them, the film tends\r\nto abandon them in order to tell yet another variation of the tale of a seeming\r\nmisfit who learns to pulls himself together, and use his gifts to save the day\r\nand make his mark on the world. Much of it feels cobbled together from elements that\r\nwill seem very familiar to anyone who saw the likes of \"The Jungle\r\nBook,\" \"The Lion King\" and \"How to Train a Dragon.\" The lack of a unique story might have been overcome if the characters had\r\nbeen compelling but alas, neither Arlo nor Spot are especially interesting.\u00a0 Advertisement Visually, \"The Good Dinosaur\" is a stunner throughout, with one breathtaking composition after another that combines gorgeously rendered\r\nphotorealistic backgrounds with the more overtly cartoony characters in an\r\nunexpectedly lovely manner. There are also a number of inspired moments where\r\nthe film threatens to break its shackles and go off into strange areas, like an encounter with a styracosaurus (whose deadpan voice is supplied by the\r\nfilm's director, Peter Sohn) who is festooned with a number of comfort animals.\r\nIn another scene, Arlo and Spot eat some fruit with hallucinogenic properties\r\nthat are depicted in amusing visual detail. The aforementioned campfire scene\r\ngets especially weird when it turns into, of all things, one of the most famous\r\nscenes from \"Jaws.\" There is even one beautifully low-key moment in\r\nwhich Arlo and Spot, despite the lack of a shared language, manage to\r\ncommunicate and commiserate with each other over the loss of their respective\r\nfamilies in a genuinely heart-tugging manner. (This moment is so strong that I\r\nwouldn't be surprised to learn that it was the initial inspiration for the\r\nentire project.) As those\r\nwho pay attention to such things already know, \"The Good Dinosaur\"\r\nhad a famously troubled production that saw its original director and most of\r\nthe original voice cast replaced, and a number of major script rewrites added in\r\nan effort to save it. With that much behind-the-scenes chaos, it is probably\r\nnot a surprise that the end result is as uneven as it turns out to be. The film\r\nwill satisfy younger viewers, I suppose, but unless your kids are especially\r\ngaga over dinosaurs, my guess is that even they will recognize that it is\r\nlacking a certain something that separates the great films from the ordinary\r\nones."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "La Bare", "Review": "Actor Joe Manganiello (\"True Blood,\" \"Magic Mike,\") had originally conceived of \"La Bare\" as a reality TV series detailing the backstage life of the male dancers at La Bare in Dallas, known as \"the most popular male strip club in the world.\" Manganiello's research for playing his role in \"Magic Mike\" had pierced through his preconceived notions of what male strippers were like, and he was curious to learn more. \"La Bare\" shows\u00a0its reality-TV origin in its structure, to sometimes a clich\u00e9d degree, but overall it is a friendly and affectionate backstage look at the world of the mostly-straight male dancers at La Bare. Advertisement There are \"confessionals\" with the various dancers, all of whom have different strengths (one says, \"I can't dance at all. But I can f***. So I use that in my act.\"), there are glimpses of the shows themselves, the screaming women, there are interviews with fans.\u00a0Some of the really interesting elements are merely sketched in, like how La Bare, which has been around since the '70s, turned itself around from a kind of skeevy dive into the showstopping club it is today. A new owner came along, a Russian named Alex, who is interviewed wearing a T-shirt with \"CCCP\" across the front. He wanted to create a strip club that was run like a business; he wanted to hire dancers who thought like businessmen and\u00a0weren't drug addicts or troublemakers; he wanted to build a brand. And he did. Alex would be compelling enough for an entire documentary. The dancers come from all walks of life. One talks about how he was homeschooled and not allowed to listen to secular music, which meant he had no idea how to dance \"to the beat\" in his early time as a dancer. One had owned a restaurant, which he then lost, and\u00a0uses dancing as a way to make money to open up another restaurant. One, with a blue mohawk and multiple piercings, talks about his time in Afghanistan and Iraq as a Ranger. Overseeing the dancers at La Bare is a larger-than-life personality named Randy (aka \"The Master Blaster\"), who has been a dancer for 34 straight years (he's in the Guinness Book of World Records). He jokes that he has now performed for\u00a0five generations of women. Randy has no children of his own and sees the dancers as his sons. He \"raises them,\" reminding them of the Golden Rule, for example. He puts them on diets, he helps them with workout plans. Randy is unable to speak without making a motivational speech. He has a devoted fan base. To counteract the idea that stripping is somehow a depressing job, and the idea that male strippers are even more \"beyond the pale\" than females, \"La Bare\" highlights the positive to destabilize those expectations. We are accustomed to female strippers being presented as victims, a simplistic attitude, and certainly not true for all of them. \"La Bare\" shows the dancers as a tight group of friends, highlighted by the fact that just prior to filming, one of the dancers, the beloved \"Angelo\" (Ruben Riguero), was killed after a scuffle at a local club for apparently no reason. But other than that, the \"horror stories\" one may expect do not materialize. These guys are more like body builders, concerned about salt intake and limiting alcohol consumption. They also try not to sleep with clientele. It's just bad business. Advertisement Each guy is extremely open to the camera, a tribute to Manganiello's questioning and attitude. One can imagine the suspicion with which the project may have been treated initially. The dancers are sensitive about being misrepresented. The openness of the interviews is captivating. The difference between strip clubs catering to men and those catering to women is discussed in the film, by both the owners of the club, as well as the dancers and the women who flock to La Bare. La Bare invests a lot of money in the shows, and each guy has a particular \"act\", some of them elaborate to an almost Cirque de Soleil degree. The guys do calendars and private parties and promotions and it's all about creating a brand for themselves. A female stripper says about all of this, \"For these guys, it is their whole lives.\" For her, not so much. So what is different about a strip club catering to women as opposed to men? One of the La Bare regulars observes that \"men are like a microwave, and women are like an oven \u2026 we need that pre-heat time.\"\u00a0Throughout the film the dancers as well as the owners of the club echo that thought. For the women who come to La Bare, they want the romance and the fantasy of the show itself, they want to be drawn in and swept away. To the dancers, female fantasy is the air they breathe: they don't treat it with condescension or contempt, they cater to it directly. It's strangely refreshing in today's climate where there are worried think-pieces about what 50 Shades of Grey means and what should we DO about it? \"La Bare\" takes its time to profile some of the side figures, like Pablo the backstage hand, or the guy who DJs for the club. These sections feel like filler. They sag and lag. It is the dancers who fascinate, and in its own stealthy way, \"La Bare\" opens up a little bit of breathing space around the idea of masculinity, how it operates, and what it actually looks like. There are definitely depths to be plumbed in the conversation about objectification and sexuality, particularly in the realm of men. \"La Bare\" approaches the issue indirectly, and yet in a way, it's the whole point. Men who put their sexuality out there like that are often seen as \"feminized\", and that word is used an insult (disturbing because it assumes that being \"feminine\" is a negative). These guys don't worry about any of that. They are there as fantasy figures and they work hard to provide that fantasy. One of the dancers reports that he asked a woman why she likes coming to La Bare so often. She replied, \"When I come here, I feel pretty.\" That's a pretty strong statement about what these shows provide. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "How to Survive a Plague", "Review": "Then, miraculously, a cocktail of several drugs, including AZT, was tried along with protease inhibitors that prolonged its effectiveness. One of the survivors of that time recalls it in David France's documentary \"How to Survive a Plague.\" Symptoms seemed to reverse themselves. Cancerous skin lesions disappeared. Patients began to gain weight. Within a month, blood counts were near normal, and health seemed to be restored. Many found it hard to believe, and still today feel some guilt that they are alive while millions around the world have died. Advertisement The documentary charts the rise of the AIDS crisis from its earliest days. It benefits enormously by a wealth of video footage taken by ACT UP and other groups, showing urgent meetings of victims, who demonstrated and even demanded arrest outside federal and municipal buildings and hospitals.  That was effective in raising awareness of a calamity so stigmatized that President Ronald Reagan scarcely even mentioned; George H.W. Bush noted it was caused by behavior and recommended \"change your behavior\" \u2014 scant comfort for those staring death in the face. Bill Clinton, on the campaign trail, was scarcely in the forefront of the cause and seems startled when he is the target of demonstrations. But AIDS activism was not limited to demonstrations. The film spotlights scientists, researchers and a retired chemist, not all of them HIV-positive, who did invaluable work in calling attention to a treatment protocol and promising drugs worldwide. Surprisingly, they won seats on boards overseeing the crisis, as one federal official observes: \"They know more than we do.\" It was a dreadful time. Politicians did not want to be associated with the disease. Hospitals resisted admitting victims, and when an AIDS victim died, some health-care workers would place the body in a black garbage bag. Funeral homes refused to accept the corpses. \"How to Survive a Plague\" follows the drama with the immediacy of the video shot at the time, and some of its most fascinating scenes involve scientists from drug companies such as Merck explaining the slow growth of knowledge about the nature of the disease. We grow familiar with the names and faces of many of the leaders in the movement. Some look directly into the camera and say they expect to die of the disease. Some are correct. The most heartbreaking scene shows survivors of the dead reaching through fence railings to scatter their ashes on the White House lawn, where presumably they still rest."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se", "Review": "In \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\", Claude Miller's final film and his first collaboration with actress Audrey Tautou, an intelligent heiress allows herself to be smothered by her boorish husband and domineering in-laws.\u00a0She rebels modestly, chain-smoking, and selectively refusing to appear happy for the sake of appeasing her husband Bernard (Gilles Lelouche), a man that she only married for convenience's sake.\u00a0 \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\" treats marriage as a means of simultaneously dropping out and embracing her marginal role in society. Her father owns a valuable plot of pine forests. So do Bernard's. The two frankly agree to marry to make their already-rich families richer. Therese then writes to her best friend Anne (Anais Demoustier), Bernard's sister, that she wants to marry Bernard because she wants to be saved from the burden of her thoughts. She wants to disappear, but soon finds living with Bernard to be intolerable. Advertisement But while Th\u00e9r\u00e8se tells Bernard that, unlike him, she could never easily discern her own motives, Miller usually makes it too easy to understand his heroine. Her problems can mostly be traced to the Desqueyrouxs, a family whose arch insensitivity to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's feelings make them easy targets for our scorn. The fact that this was, at some point, the life that Desqueyroux chose, and that she accepted married life as a form of self-imposed exile, is not as important to Miller and fellow screenwriter Natalie Carter. They do their fascinating subject a disservice by making her a domestic martyr.  Miller is at least right to foreground Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Bernard's understanding that they aren't marrying for love's sake. In fact, it's soon revealed that the kind of security she's after is not the kind one traditionally associates with marriage. She is not willful enough to emulate Anne, who wants to marry a man she cares about. Anne's tryst with Jean Azevedo (Stanley Weber), a Bourdeaux native that Bernard nevertheless says looks \"Jewish,\" proves what Th\u00e9r\u00e8se already suspects: it does not pay to stick your neck out in a community where everybody knows, and affects, each other's private affairs.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the self-loathing implications of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's decision to talk Jean out of marrying Anne are moot, since Jean was never as interested in Anne as she was by him. Miller similarly de-emphasizes interesting psychological details like that, and instead prefers to make it seem as though Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's struggles with Bernard are the source of her problems. This is unfortunate since Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Bernard's relationship is loud enough as-is. Though Miller does a good job of replicating the deceptive placidity of Desqueyroux's homelife, it's easy to understand why, as Bernard later asks, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se despises him. Advertisement There are a couple of scenes that establish implied differences in Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Bernard's points-of-view, like when she looks contemptuously at him as he participates in a local mass (Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is an atheist). But there are many more scenes where Bernard and his family do everything short of spitting on Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to prove their contempt for her, like when Bernard and his servants repeatedly refer to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se as Bernard's dog. So when Th\u00e9r\u00e8se finally starts doing something to get back at Bernard, the shocking nature of her crime is off-set by the fact that he unequivocally deserves it. \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\" never goes beyond that level of psychological complexity because after a point, Miller and Carter aren't interested in exploring the murky depths of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se 's feelings. Once they've established the stifling social hierarchy that she can never bring herself to either accept or reject, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's inactivity speaks for her. But that doesn't lend her story an air of mystery as much as it allows her character to languish while the Desqueyrouxs marginalize her presence in their household as much as they can without causing a public scandal.  It only looks like Tautou does a lot with a little in her performance because much of her character's inner life is implied through pensive scenes of her frowning and deferring her gaze. Tautou's worried stare is supposed to be fraught with meaning, and she's a good enough actress to pull that off. But within the context of a melodrama where the impenetrability of actions belie a lack of clear motives, a look doesn't establish an inner universe of meaning, just the space where such a universe should go.

{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "No Good Deed", "Review": "\"No Good Deed\" inspired controversy in certain circles\r\nwhen Screen Gems, the studio releasing it, decided to scrap all of its previously\r\nannounced advanced press and word-of-mouth screenings at almost literally the\r\nlast second. When pressed for a reason, they explained that there was a plot\r\ntwist so crucial that they wanted\r\naudiences to experience it for themselves, without having critics ruin it for them\r\nahead of time. As rationales go, this one is hard to swallow, but\r\nconsidering just how preposterous the film as a whole is, it seems of a piece. Advertisement Idris\r\nElba stars as Colin Evans. As the story begins, he's up for parole\r\nafter spending five years in prison in Knoxville for killing a man in a bar\r\nfight gone bad. Speaking before the parole board, he offers himself up as a\r\nchanged man\u2014he has even begun programs behind bars that the governor plans on instituting throughout the state\u2014but his efforts are thwarted by a pesky board member who has the nerve to bring up the five women that he\r\nallegedly murdered, though no tangible proof could be uncovered, and the\r\nnarcissistic personality disorder that puts him up there with the likes\r\nof Jeffrey Dahmer. This understandably bums him out, and, on the return trip to\r\nprison, he murders the guards transporting him and escapes, stopping along the\r\nway to brutally beat his apparently faithless girlfriend to death in an ugly\r\nsequence that is flashed back upon throughout the film. (I wouldn't dream\r\nof suggesting that the real reason behind the scrapping of screenings might\r\nbe because of squeamishness over having to promote a film, during this particular week, in which a man savagely\u00a0beats his girlfriend\u2014but if you\r\nwould like to, I won't stop you.)  Trying to\r\ndrive through a terrible storm to freedom, Colin wrecks his car and turns up on the doorstep of Terri (Taraji P. Henson), a former hotshot\r\nprosecutor (specializing in cases involving violence against women, naturally). Terri is now a stay-at-home mom who frets that her husband (Henry Simmons) is no\r\nlonger interested in her. Sure, the husband is out of town on a golfing trip,\r\nand, sure, it is just her and her two young children by themselves, but when this\r\nstranger rings her doorbell asking to use her phone, Terri sees nothing wrong\r\nwith inviting him in, letting him make himself at home, and even gazing at him\r\nadoringly when she sees him changing his shirt. However, before the film can\r\nturn into a late-'80s Heart video, Colin reveals his true\r\ncolors, and \"No Good Deed\" turns into what can only grudgingly be considered a game of cat and mouse. \"No Good Deed\" might have chosen to develop its story in a manner that respects the intelligence\r\nof its viewers, by offering them ingenious twists on a familiar theme while\r\nalways playing fair with them. It chooses instead to drag out the usual cliches in a\r\nmanner so lazy as to display contempt for anyone foolish enough to pay to see the result. After about sixteen seconds of screen time, it\r\nbecomes painfully evident that director Sam Miller and screenwriter Aimee Lagos have made a home invasion thriller that isn't so much\r\n\"The Desperate Hours\" as it is simply desperate. In order to keep the\r\nflimsy narrative going, both allegedly brilliant characters are forced to act stupidly. When even that isn't enough to help move things\r\nalong, Lagos has to awkwardly insert a number of painful contrivances\u2014a storm that is able to disguise or reveal incriminating sounds as\r\nrequired, a hot-to-trot neighbor (Leslie Bibb) who serves the same purpose here\r\nthat Scatman Crothers did in \"The Shining\" (though she neglects to\r\nbring a snowplow with her) and a car alarm that miraculously knows\r\nexactly when to trip itself. The only\r\nthing missing here is a cat jumping out of the shadows every so often. Maybe\r\nthe cat demanded script approval. Advertisement The only startling thing about \"No Good Deed\" is the fact that actors as talented as Idris Elba and Taraji P.\r\nHenson decided to sign on for a project that plays like a failed attempt at a\r\nLifetime movie. Elba, of course, has been venerated in many quarters for his\r\nwork on \"The Wire,\" and Henson has proven herself a\r\ndelightful presence in films like \"Hustle & Flow\" and \"The\r\nCurious Case of Benjamin Button.\" To see them trying and ultimately\r\nfailing to breathe life into these cliches is depressing. \u00a0 I guess I\r\nshould mention that towards the end of \"No Good Deed,\" there is\r\nsomething that could technically be considered a shocking plot twist. However,\r\nin this particular case, the twist is so absurd, so arbitrary, and has so little\r\neffect on the proceedings that it feels like the kind of thing that Tyler Perry\r\nmight have scratched for being too ridiculous.\u00a0 For the\r\nrecord, there is an excellent 2002 film by the name of \"No Good\r\nDeed,\" a nifty film noir that was directed by the great Bob Rafelson and\r\nco-starred Samuel L. Jackson and Milla Jovovich. This was a thriller that was\r\nsmartly conceived, wonderfully executed and filled with strong performances\r\n(anyone requiring additional proof that Jovovich is more than just a pretty\r\nface is advised to check it out), and it always played fair with\r\nviewers as it unfolded its twisty narrative. That the 2002 \"No Good Deed\" has no relation to this one is another element in its favor."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Blood Father", "Review": "When Mel Gibson was first becoming known as a film actor, he had a lot of obvious things going for him: acting talent, good looks, ruggedness, a charisma that could land on either side of \u201csly\u201d or \u201cmenacing.\u201d In other words, arguably, all the stardom requisites. But he was interesting beyond that, because of the movies he was in. Pictures such as \u201cMad Max\u201d and \u201cThe Year of Living Dangerously\u201d were debatably genre pictures but they had energy and intelligence that was way beyond generic. It seemed also that Gibson had meaningful alliances with the makers of those films, directors George Miller and Peter Weir. Whether it was just happenstance that all these guys were coming up in the Australian film industry at the same time or if Gibson himself was indeed a more-discriminating-than-average film actor didn\u2019t matter; it looked good. And when Gibson made his big-Hollywood move in \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d he did, although it\u2019s tough to really remember it properly now, play a pretty odd variant of the risk-everything-cop-hero.\u00a0 Advertisement \n I don\u2019t need to rehash the personal explosions perpetrated by Gibson that, among other things, put his career in a kind of purgatory. I can infer, though, that a casual Gibson follower discovering that this week he stars in an action thriller called \u201cBlood Father\u201d might himself infer that Gibson is working his way out of that purgatory via the Nicolas Cage route of hastily conceived and assembled shoot-em-up hackwork. I am pleased to report this is not actually the case. Clocking in at a fat-free 88 minutes, \u201cBlood Father,\u201d directed by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet (the man behind the Vincent Cassel gangster epic \u201cMesrine\u201d) is an efficient and pleasurable bad-man-tries-to-go-good exposition that gives Gibson ample opportunity to flex his now-somewhat-grizzled movie-star muscle.\u00a0 \n The movie opens with a shot of a young girl in a missing-person\u2019s flyer, then cuts to a shot of a retail-market conveyer belt moving lots of boxes of bullets, and finally a pack of bubblegum. The young woman buying the stuff, Lydia (Erin Moriarty) is the girl from the flyer; when she asks that a pack of Camel Lights be added to her purchase, the cashier asks her for proof of age. Get it? Fortunately that\u2019s the movie\u2019s first and last venture into coy \u201cAin\u2019t That \u2018Murica?\u201d humor. Lydia delivers the ammo to a car full of her shady pals, including a slicked-down Diego Luna, and they\u2019re off on a pretty bad misadventure.\u00a0 \n Cut to a closeup of Gibson, his very lined face partially covered by a very full beard, making a confession in an AA meeting. Gibson\u2019s ex-con John Link is two years sober, has a vigilant sponsor named Kirby (William H. Macy), and runs a tattoo parlor out of a big trailer in a very sparsely populated California trailer park. And on the corkboard at the entry of the trailer is, yep, that missing persons flyer with young Lydia\u2019s picture on it. So you know who\u2019s going to be on the other end of the line when the phone rings. Advertisement \n \u201cBlood Father,\u201d written by Peter Craig and Andrea Berloff from a novel by Craig, avoids\u2014at least for the most part\u2014the clich\u00e9s of the father-protects-daughter thrillers made famous by Liam Neeson by giving the daughter a little bit of bad-apple-ness, or bad-assness, herself. She\u2019s in a bad situation and she\u2019s also hooked on drugs and alcohol, so once Link swoops in to take her under his wing he\u2019s also got a rehab project to tackle. On top of which he\u2019s not a man of means\u2014there\u2019s no arsenal stashed under the floorboards of his trailer. For a time he\u2019s got only his wits to live by, and those have been somewhat scrambled by his life circumstances, not to mention the sudden reunion. It\u2019s refreshing to hear father and daughter cuss each other out and have neither one pause to make a remark about bad manners\u2014they both speak the same profane language. Which isn\u2019t to say Gibson\u2019s character is any kind of permissive dad. When Link and Lydia check into a motel together, a google-eyed young clerk (Thomas Mann) asks conspiratorially, \u201cWhere\u2019d you find her?\u201d \u201cIn the delivery room,\u201d Gibson shoots back, implying with mere tone and speed all the ways he\u2019d kill the other guy if given an excuse.\u00a0 \n Just as the movie could use an infusion of villainy, Michael Parks turns up as a former criminal associate of Link\u2019s who now sells Nazi memorabilia online from his desolate ranch, and Parks makes a meal of the part. The movie builds up a good head of steam before delivering a very satisfying wrap-up, and the twist in the climax feels legitimate because Richet lets the audience understand that Link\u2019s playing the only card he\u2019s got. Make what you will of how much Gibson\u2019s performance draws from his own wrestling of personal demons; suffice it to say that the line \u201cYou can\u2019t be a prick all your life and just say never mind\u201d has a sting that wouldn\u2019t be there in a movie he wasn\u2019t starring in."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "As Above, So Below", "Review": "I wish I could recommend \"As Above, So Below\" more strongly. It's that rare found-footage film with a strong premise,\u00a0 a memorably eccentric style, and plenty of energy to burn. It's also poorly conceived, and hard to watch. Normally, that's not such a terrible thing when it comes to B-horror films, the kind of genre fare that handily coasts on chutzpah alone. Then again, the novelty of exploring an already-confined space\u2014subterranean Parisian catacombs\u2014shot through a conspicuous fish-eye lens is only so endearing. That's the biggest stumbling obstacle preventing viewers from enjoying \"As Above, So Below,\" a movie that's as close as recent horror films have come to approximating the feel of a haunted-house attraction. The film's violent, Richard Simmons-worthy shakey-camerawork evokes \"Saving Private Ryan\"'s Omaha Beach sequence. There's some great impressionistic visual cues throughout the film, as when dust and rubble scatter around the camera during the film's introductory scene. And the movie's cramped setting makes the film atmospheric enough to be frequently creepy. But when the film's protagonists finally put their rinky-dink digital head-rigs down, you will cheer, and it won't be for them. Advertisement Since it's a movie-shaped theme park ride, \"As Above, So Below\" is bogged down by way too much narrative baggage. Human-shaped plot point Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) is our guide through the French tunnels. A super-smart explorer in search of the Philosopher's Stone, Scarlett enlists the help of fraidy-cat language expert George (Ben Feldman, or Ginsberg from \"Mad Men\"), stoic cameraman Benji (Edwin Hodge), and full-of-it urban explorer Papillon (Francois Civil). Together with Papillon's companions Souxie and Zed (Marion Lambert and Ali Marhyar), Scarlett's group searches the French catacombs for the Stone, and inadvertently discovers what may or may not be a gateway to Hell. Along the way, they're improbably confronted with a laundry list of goofy ghosts and creepy objects, including a haunted telephone, an impossibly deep pool of blood, a burning car, and a malnourished\u2014and probably undead\u2014French raver named La Taupe (Cosme Castro).\u00a0 This gruel-thin scenario is perfectly reasonable when you think of it in the context of crass real-life attractions like Berlin's Grusellkabinett, a haunted house attraction built on top of preserved Nazi bunkers. It's garish and excessive, but seeing stone gargoyles, anorexic witches, and hanged men in the midst of an already creepy setting can be fun when you accept that the name of the game is sheer overkill. Morever, Weeks and Feldman don't have to do much to sell their stick figure protagonists' enthusiasm. Feldman and Weeks are charming enough to make you believe that their characters really want to explore, and are therefore always thinking of new, moronic ways to discover the next secret chamber, push through the next tiny hole, and sneak past that one corpse that looks suspiciously like the Bad Seeds' Warren Ellis. You actually won't find fault with their generic need to see and do things that normal, semi-intelligent people know not to, like take the hood off of a hanged man's face. It's a bad idea, but not an offensive decision in a film that sometimes feels like a series of video-game cut scenes you cannot fast-forward through. Then again, \"As Above, So Below\" falters most when it tries to be a movie. When Scarlett's group tries to assert themselves as people (!!!) haunted by personal trauma\u2014dead dads, brothers, guys in cars, etc.\u2014the film drags needlessly. Like, I'm sorry, but if you're going to wander around teeny-tiny tunnels that may or may not be the path to an infernal plane of existence, I don't really care what your pre-Hellmouth life was like. That stuff is for your therapist, not a 93-minute survival-horror adventure. Advertisement Still, if I could get a clear view of the ghost of your dead gallic buddy, or the aforementioned gargoyle that possibly (?) has took a bite out of your face, you could throw any number of dead friends, relatives, and notary publics at me. The makers of \"As Above, So Below\" earn points for trying to make their film look different than the preponderance of found-footage junk. But their distinctive, impressionistic camera-work is also head-splittingly alienating. Even viewers with cast-iron stomachs will want a barf-bag, a bottle of Dasani, and a strong shoulder to rest their head on just to prevent early on-set car-sickness. \"As Above, So Below\" is novel enough to be worth the price of admission, but you'll think twice before getting back in line for a second visit."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Lorna's Silence", "Review": "The Dardenne brothers focus intently on individuals in their films, which are among the best in recent years. In such films as \u201cRosetta\u201d (1999), \u201cLe Fils\u201d (\u201cThe Son,\u201d 2002) and \u201cL\u2019Enfant\u201d (\u201cThe Child,\u201d 2005), their camera scarcely allow the protagonists to escape the frame. \u201cLorna\u2019s Silence\u201d begins that way, but allows shots in which Lorna is not even present. A plot begins to unfold which she isn\u2019t aware of. Lorna (Arta Dobroshi) is a young woman of about 30 from Albania, now resident in Belgium. She is a beneficiary and exploiter of the marriage-for-sale racket. A pathetic drug addict named Claudy has married her for money, a vermin named Fabio has arranged this marriage, Fabio plans to arrange Claudy\u2019s death, a Russian will pay Lorna to marry him so he can obtain a passport and then, Lorna believes, she will be free to marry her lover Sokol. They even know the little storefront where they talk of opening a cafe. Advertisement It is all so shabby and sad. And dominating the early scenes is the character of Claudy (Jeremie Renier), who wants to quit heroin cold turkey and is a wretched, needy, trembling creature. Renier\u2019s performance is the best thing in the movie, although all the actors, cast partly for their faces, are part of creating this desperate world. Lorna treats Claudy coldly. He telephones her incessantly. He is afraid to be left alone. Eventually his pathos wears her down; she\u2019s not an evil woman, just an opportunist. She wonders if it might not be possible for her to divorce Claudy, rather than clear the stage with an overdose \u2014 Fabio\u2019s plan. The gift of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne is to show their characters as trapped in personal human situations; they\u2019re not creatures of a plot. Fabio (Fabrizio Rongione), for example, isn\u2019t a \u201cvillain\u201d; he is simply a man brutal and heartless by nature, and driven entirely by money. He has a callow flunky named Spirou (Morgan Marinne), who is servile as a cur. Both Rongione and Marinne have the hard faces of bullies; you would feel wary of them on sight. That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re that way in person. They may be jolly good chaps for all I know. Here they are reptilian. That\u2019s partly because the Dardennes shoot them mostly in profile; a full face seems open to us, but a side shot from an oblique angle can seem sinister. If everyone has a \u201cgood side,\u201d the Dardennes must figure out which it is, in order to avoid it. All centers on Lorna (Arta Dobroshi). She is a pleasant-enough young woman, crisp, direct. I\u2019ve seen photos of her with a warm smile. In \u201cLorna\u2019s Silence,\u201d she plays a woman who is deprived of her bodily integrity even more than a prostitute might be; she hasn\u2019t been bought and sold because of sex, but simply because of her gender. Claudy married her for money, the Russian doesn\u2019t care if he sleeps with her, and Sokol is a snaky man who is out of the country most of the time. His qualities exist mostly in her mind. Advertisement The Dardennes do something I haven\u2019t see them do before. There is a considerable time lapse in the story, while basic changes take place with the characters. Lorna\u2019s nature shifts. I\u2019m not saying this is bad, but it releases the tension they generate when they stay close in time and space. Still, what power is here. What affecting acting by Dobroshi, Renier (who in \u201cL\u2019Enfant\u201d played the father who sold and desperately tried to rebuy his child) and Marinne (who was the apprentice with the dark past in \u201cThe Son.\u201d). In the cold, harsh world of the Dardennes, they feel sympathy, but can grant little mercy."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The 5th Wave", "Review": "\"The 5th Wave,\" from the get-go, has difficulty establishing tone and mood. Teenager Cassie Sullivan (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz), clutching an automatic weapon, has a standoff in an abandoned mini mart with a wounded soldier begging for his life. Close-ups of Moretz's terrified face predominate throughout. Cassie's voiceover then kicks in, informing us that before all this, she was a \"normal\" teenage girl. Those words are a betrayal of the character Rick Yancey created in his popular YA series. There's nothing \"normal\" about Cassie in the book, but onscreen, Moretz hasn't been given a character she can sink her teeth into. Cassie onscreen never comes to life, and without Cassie, the film doesn't come to life either. Even the most primal scenes (mass executions, family reunions, goodbyes), are ho-hum. Advertisement Cassie lives with her parents (Ron Livingston and Maggie Siff) and her little brother Sam (Zackary Arthur). Her \"normal\" life disappears when a mysterious object appears in the sky over earth. Then come the different \"waves\" of attack from the aliens referred to as \"The Others.\" The first wave is an electromagnetic pulse that kills the power across the globe. Airplanes fall from the sky. The second wave is a series of tsunamis that wipe out coastal areas. The third wave is a plague that kills millions more. The fourth wave involves snipers who stalk and kill the survivors of the other waves. And the fifth wave, unknown, is imminent. Cassie's mother dies in the plague. The rest of the family trek to a makeshift refugee camp in the woods (where everyone is armed to the teeth). One day, Army tanks show up (the military is immune to the power outage, a fact never explained), and the intimidating Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) carts the children off in school busses to an undisclosed location, promising the panicked adults that they will soon follow. Vosch, at first a savior who takes charge, has more up his sleeve, and Cassie is left to flee through the woods, clutching her little brother's beloved teddy bear. The narrative splits between Cassie's journey and the journey of her high school crush Ben Parish (Nick Robinson, believable as a boy who has been completely traumatized). Cassie, determined to find her brother, camps in the woods, is shot in the leg by a sniper, and then rescued by a farm-boy named Evan Walker (Alex Roe). Evan is caring but mysterious. He also has blazing baby-blues and rock-hard abs. What would have happened if Cassie had been rescued by a guy who looked like Wilford Brimley? (In the book, the Evan Walker section is extremely strange and suspenseful. Here, it takes on an embarrassing \"Blue Lagoon\"-ish quality - especially when she peeks longingly at his sculpted torso while he bathes in a river.)\u00a0 Advertisement Ben Parish is taken off with the other kids to an Air Force Base, and put through military boot-camp for the upcoming fight against The Others. The trash-talking kid-soldiers play poker in their barracks, go through weapons training, all under the watchful eye of Colonel Vosch's hard-assed medical assistant (Maria Bello). The kid-soldier episodes have an inadvertent absurdity to them, especially when Ben, squad leader, yells at one of his comrades while taking enemy fire: \"Stay low!\" (The child can't help but \"stay low\". The child is only three feet tall. His rifle is taller than he is.) A new member of Ben's squad, a deadpan teenage girl nick-named Ringer (Maika Monroe, in a fun performance), challenges his authority, but is an asset in battle. She can shoot a moving target. The strengths of director J. Blakeson and production designer Jon Billington lie in the apocalyptic wasteland scenes: a highway filled with crashed cars, corpses piled up, orange fires raging through a dark landscape. The colors are sometimes too bright for such a grim story, and the shattering\u00a0of group trauma isn't present (the way it is in the opening scenes of \"The Hunger Games\"). Cassie's determination to find her brother is sentimentalized (so many closeups of that teddy bear). In the book Cassie is ravaged by grief and rage. Here, she just seems slightly put-out and sometimes super-scared. Moretz is an excellent actress but she is unable to give Cassie the depth that \"The 5th Wave\" needs. (Her hair also remains freshly shampooed throughout, even while squatting in the woods for, apparently, weeks on end. Details matter.) \"The 5th Wave\" is Dystopia-Lite. When a book is adapted for the screen, there are reasons why some tangential plot points need to go. But Susannah Grant, Akiva Goldsman, and Jeff Pinkner, the screenwriting team who adapted Yancey's book, have destroyed the book's rich texture. Maybe it's unfair to judge a movie adaptation on the source material, but when problems arise in such situations, it's often a problem of adaptation. Even worse, it may make audiences think the book is as silly as the movie. Post-apocalyptic stories tap into a need to imagine our own destruction, a need pricked with anxiety-filled questions: \"What would I do in this situation? How would I fare?\" Literature abounds with such stories. Shelley's \"Ozymandias\" depicts a statue of an ancient king crumbling in the desert sand. T.S. Eliot's \"The Hollow Men,\" with its images of broken columns and fading stars, and its famous final lines, \"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper,\" expresses post-WWI European desolation. Authors Aldous Huxley and George Orwell, Margaret Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road,\" Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", Stephen King's \"The Mist,\" H.G. Wells' \"The War of the Worlds,\" 1950s sci-fi movies, comic books, all laid the groundwork for the Dystopian Literary Craze in which we now live. Lois Lowry's 1993 \"The Giver,\" aimed at a YA audience, ushered in a new era of Dystopian books for teenagers. Suzanne Collins' successful \"Hunger Games\" franchise has spawned a million imitators. If \"Anne of Green Gables\" were to be published today, the plucky red-headed orphan would have to crawl through an industrial wasteland to get any attention. Rick Yancey's trilogy (the final installment\u00a0scheduled for May 2016) is filled with haunting imagery of the earth left more than half-empty, but most chillingly, he understands tyranny and how it operates: if you can make confused frightened people line up and march towards the exits in an orderly fashion, you're halfway towards owning them completely.\u00a0 These important elements are sketched-in and undeveloped in the film. Instead, we're left with Cassie and Evan throwing longing looks at one another, confusing monologues where people figure out what the \"5th wave\" is, and reunion scenes that have no punch. The closing narration is milquetoast cliche, something the Cassie in the book, with her raw tenderized heart, would never have tolerated. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Futuro Beach", "Review": "\u201cWhat kind of movie is this? Where could it possibly be\r\nheading?\u201d Normally, if you find yourself asking such questions, say, a\r\nhalf-hour into a movie, it\u2019s a sign of one of two possible things. Either the\r\nfilm is a hopeless, unfocused muddle that doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s up to. Or it\u2019s\r\npurposefully oblique, taking us on a journey to new and unexpected cinematic\r\ndestinations. Happily, Karim A\u00efnouz\u2019s \u201cFuturo Beach\u201d is a prime example of\r\nthe latter. And in this case, the unusual artistic itinerary is mirrored by a\r\nsignificant geographic-cultural one. Advertisement The tale begins on the eponymous Brazilian beach, a stretch\r\nof brilliantly white sand, except that in the film\u2019s first minutes our gaze is\r\ndrawn away from it and under the ocean\u2019s waves, where bodies are flailing in a\r\nway that makes desperation seem almost balletic. Two men are threatened with\r\ndrowning, and one doesn\u2019t return from the sea. One of the rescuers, Donato (Wagner Moura), is an\r\nordinary-seeming twentysomething who has an ailing mother and a younger\r\nbrother, Ayrton (Savio Ygor Ramos), age ten, who worships him to the point of\r\ndubbing him a superhero\u2014Aquaman. A day or so after the apparent drowning,\r\nDonato is in his office when the lost man\u2019s pal drops by to discuss the\r\nsituation. Konrad (Clemens Schick) is a German, a rough-hewn veteran of the\r\nAfghanistan war. He and his friend had been on a journey down to South America,\r\naiming eventually to return to the motorcycle repair shop they own in Berlin.\r\nDonato explains that the attempt to find the body will continue. Once the\r\nmeeting concludes, he offers Konrad a ride back to his hotel. Cut to: the two men in a torrid sexual encounter,\r\nsweat-soaked, the German aggressively thrusting into his gasping partner.\r\nThough this scene arrives only a few minutes into the story, perhaps it\u2019s fair\r\nto ask: Can we now type what we\u2019re watching as a gay film, though one that,\r\ngiven its manner, might also be considered an art film? Perhaps, but it\u2019s remarkable how little this tells us about\r\nthe characters, what the film is up to or where\u2019s it\u2019s headed. In another good\r\nexample of the gay/art blend, Alain Guiraudie\u2019s \u201cStranger by the Lake,\u201d we\r\nsense from fairly early on that it\u2019s a Hitchockian thriller with certain\r\nreadily identifiable gay types caught up in the drama. Here there are no such\r\nconvenient genre or character markers. Moreover, everything is conveyed with\r\nmaximum obliqueness. In the scene in Donato\u2019s office, for example, there are\r\nhints of what will happen next, but they are so subtle that they perhaps can be\r\nrecognized only in retrospect. Everything that follows is equally circumspect. The search\r\nfor Konrad\u2019s friend continues, and one night he and Donato go down to the pounding\r\nsurf to see if it has washed up on the rocks. Konrad talks about continuing his\r\ntrek southward and returning when the body is found. What\u2019s just below the\r\nsurface here is just the opposite of what\u2019s being said: Konrad doesn\u2019t really\r\nwant to leave Donato, who also isn\u2019t eager to part. We understand this when the second of the film\u2019s three parts\r\nbegins. The two men are now living in Berlin, where Konrad is teaching Donato\r\nthe language. Konrad has returned to his other passion, motorcycles, and takes\r\nlong rides at night by himself. How do the two men feel about each, as the days\r\nturn into months? It\u2019s hard to tell; they are working class guys who obviously\r\naren\u2019t in the habit of verbalizing their feelings. Indeed, it\u2019s easier to get a\r\nsense of their relationship from watching them dance in a disco than from\r\nanything they say. Advertisement Eventually, though, it\u2019s clear that Donato is depressed by\r\nthe grayness of Berlin. \u201cI can\u2019t live in a place without a beach,\u201d he says. He\r\nannounces his intention to return to Brazil, buys a ticket and makes all the\r\nnecessary preparations. Konrad accompanies him on the train to the airport. But\r\nwhen the train reaches the airport stop, Donato doesn\u2019t get off. Ultimately, \u201cFuturo Beach\u201d is a film about displacement and\r\nidentity, love and its costs. Its considerable satisfactions, though, come\r\nmainly from the way the story is told, which spells nothing out, and in fact is\r\nso reticent that the viewer is constantly drawn into the creation of meaning.\r\nThis is a poetic approach, to be sure, but it is entirely nonchalant and\r\nunstudied; and it extends to the understated beauty of the visuals, where the\r\ncontrast between the bright colors of Brazil and muted hues of Berlin is its\r\nown drama. A\u00efnouz, who was born in Brazil and now lives in Berlin, has\r\nsaid that Fassbinder\u2019s \u201cAli: Fear Eats the Soul\u201d was in his mind when making\r\nthis film. I was reminded more of early films by Wim Wenders such as \u201cAlice in\r\nthe Cities,\u201d as well as Fatih Akin\u2019s \u201cHead On,\u201d another great movie about\r\nimmigrants in present-day Germany. As such comparisons suggest, A\u00efnouz is now\r\nin a great place: the company of masters."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Reader", "Review": "The crucial decision in \"The Reader\" is made by a 24-year-old youth, who has information that might help a woman about to be sentenced to life in prison, but withholds it. He is ashamed to reveal his affair with this woman. By making this decision, he shifts the film's focus from the subject of German guilt about the Holocaust and turns it on the human race in general. The film intends his decision as the key to its meaning, but most viewers may conclude that \"The Reader\" is only about the Nazis' crimes and the response to them by post-war German generations. Advertisement The film centers on a sexual relationship between Hanna (Kate Winslet), a woman in her mid-30s, and Michael (David Kross), a boy of 15. That such things are wrong is beside the point; they happen, and the story is about how it connected with her earlier life and his later one. It is powerfully, if sometimes confusingly, told in a flashback framework and powerfully acted by Winslet and Kross, with Ralph Fiennes coldly enigmatic as the elder Michael. The story begins with the cold, withdrawn Michael in middle age (Fiennes), and moves back to the late 1950s on a day when young Michael is found sick and feverish in the street and taken back to Hanna's apartment to be cared for. This day, and all their days together, will be obsessed with sex. Hanna makes little pretense of genuinely loving Michael, who she calls \"kid,\" and although Michael has a helpless crush on Hanna, it should not be confused with love. He is swept away by the discovery of his own sexuality.  What does she get from their affair? Sex, certainly, but it seems more important that he read aloud to her: \"Reading first. Sex afterwards.\" The director, Stephen Daldry, portrays them with a great deal of nudity and sensuality, which is correct, because for those hours, in that place, they are about nothing else. One day Hanna disappears. Michael finds her apartment deserted, with no hint or warning. His unformed ego is unprepared for this blow. Eight years later, as a law student, he enters a courtroom and discovers Hanna in a group of Nazi prison guards being tried for murder. Something during this trial suddenly makes another of her secrets clear to him and might help explain why she became a prison guard. His discovery does not excuse her unforgivable guilt. Still, it might affect her sentencing. Michael remains silent. The adult Michael has sentenced himself to a lonely, isolated existence. We see him after a night with a woman, treating her with remote politeness. He has never recovered from the wound he received from Hanna, nor from the one he inflicted on himself eight years after. She hurt him, he hurt her. She was isolated and secretive after the war, he became so after the trial. The enormity of her sin far outweighs his, but they are both guilty of allowing harm because they reject the choice to do good. Advertisement At the film's end, Michael encounters a Jewish woman in New York (Lena Olin), who eviscerates him with her moral outrage. She should. But she thinks he seeks understanding for Hanna. Not so. He cannot forgive Hanna's crimes. He seeks understanding for himself, although perhaps he doesn't realize that. In the courtroom, he withheld moral witness and remained silent, as she did, as most Germans did. And as many of us have done or might be capable of doing. There are enormous pressures in all human societies to go along. Many figures involved in the recent Wall Street meltdown have used the excuse, \"I was only doing my job. I didn't know what was going on.\" President Bush led us into war on mistaken premises, and now says he was betrayed by faulty intelligence. U.S. military personnel became torturers because they were ordered to. Detroit says it was only giving us the cars we wanted. The Soviet Union functioned for years because people went along. China still does. Many of the critics of \"The Reader\" seem to believe it is all about Hanna's shameful secret. No, not her past as a Nazi guard. The earlier secret that she essentially became a guard to conceal. Others think the movie is an excuse for soft-core porn disguised as a sermon. Still others say it asks us to pity Hanna. Some complain we don't need yet another \"Holocaust movie.\" None of them think the movie may have anything to say about them. I believe the movie may be demonstrating a fact of human nature: Most people, most of the time, all over the world, choose to go along. We vote with the tribe. What would we have done during the rise of Hitler? If we had been Jews, we would have fled or been killed. But if we were one of the rest of the Germans? Can we guess, on the basis of how most white Americans, from the North and South, knew about racial discrimination but didn't go out on a limb to oppose it? Philip Roth's great novel The Plot Against America imagines a Nazi takeover here. It is painfully thought-provoking and probably not unfair. \"The Reader\" suggests that many people are like Michael and Hanna, and possess secrets that we would do shameful things to conceal.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Fake It So Real", "Review": "There are 12 or 14 wrestlers, and together they comprise the entire Millennium Wrestling Federation, which seems to feature a title bout for its World Championship every few weeks. They have physical and relationship problems, most of them seem unemployed or in low-paying jobs, but for one shining night of the week they are stars. They have onstage personas, design their own flashy costumes, and play out scenarios of grudges, ferocity and bad-ass moves. One says he knew he'd made it when three little girls asked him for his autograph. Advertisement This is show business. Is that why I liked them so much? In some circles, they might be seen as losers, but they have taken admirable steps to bring about their dreams. During the week, they post flyers for the weekly match in gas stations and convenience stores, meet daily to rehearse and collaborate on scenarios, and in the honorable tradition of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, what they're essentially doing is renting an old barn and putting on a show. Darren Aronofsky's \"The Wrestler\" (2008), the Mickey Rourke masterpiece, was about wrestlers performing in marginal, low-rent matches. Compared to these guys, they were flying first class. Their stardom in the ring is compensation for bad luck in other areas, trouble with wives and girlfriends, economic hardship and a great deal of physical pain. Of that there's no doubt. Yes, it's true the fights are \"fixed and faked,\" in the sense that the script and the winner are decided in advance. But let's say the script calls for an opponent to lift you over his head and slam you down on the mat, climb onto the ropes and body slam you. What part of that, exactly, is not real? The members of the federation all seem to be nice guys. Robert Greene's camera follows them through seven days before a big match, and we get to know them. Many felt like outsiders until they found this family. One has a disproportionately big butt and was bullied about it in school. \"I said, God, you gave me this big ass, now show me how to use it,\" he says. On the back of his shorts are bright red lips inviting his opponent to kiss his ass. One has asthma. One has an infection and is about to miss his first match in several years. One, Chris Solar, was born prematurely with his intestines and internal organs outside his body; that's why he lacks a navel. All are muscular enough for the considerable demands of wrestling, but many are overweight. One explains, \"I'm in training. I smoke Marlboro Lights.\" The best body belongs to the rookie, Gabriel Croft, a clean-cut kid who looks like Matt Damon. He gets a lot of instruction and encouragement from the veterans, who wonder if he has the right stuff. He plays a character named the Angel Gabriel and gets some homophobic kidding, but homophobia is the water in which they all swim. There is a tenderness in the way they punish one another. As show biz, this is bottom rung. They play music from their own collections. They use Radio Shack brand strobe lights. One \"villain\" wears a dime-store Halloween mask. Admission is $5 (kids are free), and at the weekly show, the crowd may be loyal and loud, but it's small. The rent for their venue, which looks like a school auditorium, is $240, and that would take 48 tickets to cover it. There must not be a lot left over. The possibility exists that they're wrestling at a net loss to themselves.  Advertisement Greene, the documentarian, is a cousin of Chris Solar. He likes these guys and doesn't take cheap shots. The Rourke film contained a lot of painkiller use and illegal steroids. There are no drugs seen or referred to in this film, and my guess is they can't afford them. There is a rough nobility in the way they strive for fame and success. The film is alive at every moment. I'd like to attend one of their matches, but having seen this film, I might find it too painful \u2014 and I'm not talking about physical pain."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Fred Won't Move Out", "Review": "This is waiting for all of us. The slow descent into old age. The physical unsteadiness. The realization that we no longer have authority over our own lives. In the tragic version of this fate, senility also awaits us, and \"Fred Won't Move Out\" is a tragedy. Fred is played by Elliott Gould. He has lived with his wife for more than half a century in the same secluded lakeside home. Susan (Judith Roberts) still lives with him but has slipped away into Alzheimer's. Her most frequent phrase is \"whoop-de-doo!\" They have a caregiver, Victoria (Mfoniso Udofia), who lives with them and is infinitely patient. Bob and Carol (Fred Melamed and Stephanie Roth Haberle), Fred's children, arrive for a visit and have a mission. It is time, they have decided, for both parents to move into a care facility in town. Susan doesn't quite understand. Fred refuses to move. He expects the situation to continue exactly as it is. Advertisement The film is not a compelling drama so much as a poignant observation of a sad situation. It has a great many shots of trees, leaves and insects and some story gaps. The biggest gap concerns Victoria, who has apparently been here for years. What will happen to her? She sees everything, knows everything and is treated like a household appliance. There's not even a final shot of her left behind. There is a fraught scene in which a music therapist (Robert Miller) pays a visit, and the whole family, including a granddaughter named The Captain (Ariana Altman), sing old songs like \"By the Light of the Silvery Moon.\" Susan recalls every word. This scene could have been incredibly poignant but is noticeably badly photographed. The characters are almost all placed with their backs to the therapist, and for the only time in the film, a hand-held Shakycam is used. If there is a scene requiring a stable camera to allow us to observe and consider, this is that scene. Yet \"Fred Won't Move Out\" has wonderful qualities. Judith Roberts so completely embodies a beautiful person whose mind has gone. Elliott Gould is slipping and fearful as Fred, and tries to muster what must have been a powerful personality when he was young. Fred Melamed and Stephanie Roth Haberle, as the children, are matter-of-fact, although she has tact and kindness when needed. Melamed's character seems emotionally tone-deaf. This is a semi-autobiographical film by writer-director Richard Ledes, who filmed in his own home. The dedication at the end suggests a personal connection. The enormity of such a situation can be overwhelming, and Ledes doesn't manage a clear point of view. There is a jarring and inexplicable use of the song \"Hava Nagila\" that perhaps betrays the Fred character's emotional disconnect. \"Fred Won't Move Out\" isn't a \"Hava Nagila\" kind of movie."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Dancer", "Review": "When it comes to pioneers of modern choreography, most are familiar with Isadora Duncan. The American-born dancer, who embodied Greek ideals and a bohemian lifestyle, was memorably portrayed by an Oscar-nominated Vanessa Redgrave in the 1968 biopic, \u201cIsadora.\u201d She would die in 1927 after one of her signature scarves caught in the wheel spokes of an open-air car and caused her to be ejected. That tragic variation of being hung by one\u2019s own petard helped to solidify her status as a terpsichorean legend. Advertisement But the name Loie Fuller, the subject of \u201cThe Dancer\u201d who was an early supporter of Duncan, did not ring a bell\u2014at least, for me. Born Mary-Louise in 1862, she was a Chicago-area native and innovator of a brand of free-form performance art known as Serpentine Dance. Her act consisted of a costume designed from massive swatches of silk attached to long bamboo rods being whirled and twirled while Fuller circled about on an elevated stage. She also invented multi-hued dramatic lighting techniques, many now commonplace, to enhance the undulations of her voluminous fabric. However, after checking out the famous Art Nouveau posters by Jules Cheret that stylized Fuller\u2019s allure and then realizing that the silent-era filmmakers the Lumiere brothers had featured Fuller copycats in their work, I discovered I did know of the existence of the so-called \u201cLa Danseuse de la Belle Epoque.\u201d  This unique artist, who packs plenty of opportunities for visual pizzazz, seems long overdue for big-screen treatment. And given that Fuller outwardly was more of a muscular tomboy than ethereal waif,\u00a0 first-time director Stephanie Di Giusto at least has gone outside the box when casting her lead. Her choice? A French singer-songwriter turned actress known as Soko, whose bobbed brunette hair and distinctly off-beat features suggest a not-unappealing blend of Erin Moran of \u201cHappy Days\u201d fame and Bjork.  But despite an on-screen claim that her movie is based on a true story, Di Giusto\u2019s script plays fast and loose with many of the facts of Fuller\u2019s history\u2014none more so than the Old West prologue with her gold-prospecting father that involves both cattle rustling and recited excerpts of Oscar Wilde\u2019s play \u201cSalome.\u201d When Dad is shot dead in an outdoor bathtub, Fuller high-tails it to Brooklyn and takes up residence with her Temperance-warrior mother (a wasted Amanda Plummer). That is when she decides to try stage acting. When her too-large costume begins to droop mid-scene, Fuller simply lifts her skirt and spins around. The audience approves, and suddenly a dance sensation is created and Loie is born. Advertisement Soon she will seek her fortune in Paris and become a sensation at the Folies-Bergere. But not before she meets her prime benefactor and semi-consort, the vampire-like composite character of Count Louis Dorsay (Gaspard Ulliel), who likes his rooms dark as tombs, his sexual partners for hire and his mood-altering ether readily available. Most of Ulliel and Soko\u2019s scenes together tend to devolve into silent staring contests, including those at his mansion in the City of Lights. The property serves as both Fuller\u2019s new home and her rehearsal space where she trains a chorus line of tunic-garbed young followers.  This is where the youthful Duncan comes in as Fuller\u2019s seductive new student, slinky and sylph-like, whose style is more formal than intuitive. Before you can say \u201cAll About Eve,\u201d Duncan\u2014embodied by a teenage Lily-Rose Depp (the minx-like spawn of Johnny Depp and his ex, Vanessa Paradis)\u2014is bewitching her mentor and soon-to-be rival out of her clothes in a garden at dusk before leaving her high and dry in more ways than one.  \u201cThe Dancer\u201d clearly needed a better task master behind the camera. There are too many scenes of Fuller physically and mentally suffering for her art as she questions if what she does actually qualifies as dance. How many times do we need to see her soak her body in a vat of ice? Depp\u2019s lone dancing interlude is achieved primarily by an obvious body double although her seduction of Soko is effective if brief. And, overall, the editing feels weighed down rather than spritely, as one would hope for a film about freedom of movement. Too many episodes either go on too long or are too short\u2014as is the case with Fuller\u2019s climatic and triumphant debut at the Opera House.  If there is joy to be found in this story, it comes from Soko\u2019s sincere commitment, the staging of her re-creations of Fuller's astonishing routines and the subtle facial nuances of Melanie Thierry as Gabrielle, her ever-alert loyal assistant and protector. But if a biopic about a dancer causes you to search the Internet to better learn more details about its subject while yearning for more musical numbers, that can\u2019t be a good sign.  What is most damning is that Fuller was anything but a brooding loner, as she too often comes off as in the movie. Before dying from pneumonia in 1928, she would influence such artists and writers as Rodin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Yeats. She inspired both Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham. You can even sense her impact on contemporary routines featured on the TV competition show, \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance.\u201d She was given patents for her staging and lighting innovations, developed cinematic techniques and grew close to Marie Curie and her family. If only Di Giusto more ambitiously broadened her scope, she would have made a fleet-footed tribute for the ages instead of stumbling over such rich possibilities.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Brimstone & Glory", "Review": "Small towns live and die according to what seem like whims of fate. But just as every great fortune has its origin in a great crime, every small town that survives has a particular economic motor. Some are more interesting than others. The Mexican town of Tulpatec survives through pyrotechnics. \u201cBrimstone and Glory,\u201d directed by Viktor Jakovleski and backed by some of the talents behind \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild,\u201d is a documentary about that town\u2019s annual Pyrotechnics Festival, an event that, it seems, is prepared for year-round by its residents. The fireworks engineered in this place, north of Mexico City, aren\u2019t Macy\u2019s Fourth of July high-tech displays, precision engineered and digitally controlled. But they\u2019re not crude either. One hallmark of the festival is the evening devoted to large sculptures of bulls, each one packed with explosives. The point of this display is to have the bull as a launching site for various light-and-sound spectacles while never burning or in any other way damaging the sculpture itself. It\u2019s like creating a candy-dispensing pi\u00f1ata that remains whole. There\u2019s a lot of ingenuity required. Advertisement And there\u2019s a lot of danger involved. Injuries during these festivals are common. Town elders tend to be cheerful fellows who are missing an eye or a limp or several fingers. Young kids working on fireworks projects are praised for having \u201cgunpowder in the blood.\u201d The film doesn\u2019t have to push hard on a thesis about how economy determines culture. The town is an organic demonstration of it. There are religious roots to the festival. It\u2019s dedicated to a Portuguese saint who, according to legend, rescued the patients of a burning hospital without suffering a single burn. The day-to-day life of the town is lived in constant proximity to deadly materials\u2014large signs reading \u201cPeligro\u201d are everywhere. The scenes of the preparations of the explosives are fascinating, particularly because everything is so analog. Mortar and pestle are primary tools in mixing powders and dyes. And once the big day arrives, the nimble cameras operated by Jakovleski and his team get some awesome visuals. This is a movie that repays being seen on a big reflective screen, one on which the image is projected rather than one from which the image emanates. Because the light that comes off of the screen is strong and fierce. It\u2019s exhilarating and scary at the same time. The mode of this short movie is naturalistic. There are interviews of people in voiceover, but not a lot of talking-head footage. The perspective is of an observer sauntering through the town and then thrust into the middle of a fearsome but exhilarating spectacle. \u201cBrimstone and Glory\u201d took three years to make. I think the filmmakers needed that time to come up with a result that seems so simple and straightforward, yet has such deep resonance."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Review": "Forget about the plot, the actors and the director. What you require to make a new \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" are these three off-the-shelf sound effects: 1. A sudden, loud clanging noise mixed with a musical chord. 2. Snicker-snack sounds, which Freddy Krueger's steel finger claws make every time they are seen. 3. A voice deepener, to drop Freddy's speaking voice to an ominous level.  On top of that, you need your sudden cuts, your lighting from below, your thump-thump-thumps and of course a dog that barks at something unseen in the night, so that your teenage heroine can go out on the lawn in bare feet and flimsy PJs and call \"Rufus! Rufus! Here, boy!\" You know in your bones that Rufus is now checking into Doggie Heaven. Advertisement Oh, and actors. Lots of Dead Teenagers, seen in the last moments of their lives, when they enjoy a farewell Moment of Deceptive Safety just before there's a sudden loud clanging noise and the snicker-snack claws disembowel them and Freddy rumbles, You have nothing to worry about. This won't hurt one \u2026 little ... bit. The 2010 edition of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" is number 8 1/2 in the series. I arrive at that number not out of a desperate desire to be seeing the Fellini film instead, but because \"Freddy vs. Jason\" (2003) should in all fairness count for half a film on this list, and half a film on the \"Friday the 13th\" list. It is sad to think of all those Dead Teenagers. They were played by ambitious, talented young actors, some of them now in their 40s, who survived grueling auditions for the honor of being slashed by Freddy. Some of them are now successful: Johnny Depp, for example. Robert Englund became famous playing Freddy, but where can that lead when you're always wearing a mask of makeup. Now Jackie Earle Haley plays the role. For what purpose? He might as well play Santa Claus. It was 26 long years ago when Freddy first began to haunt the nightmares of the children of Elm Street in Springwood, Ohio. At least 137 victims have been claimed by Freddy in the years since then, but the shady little street is still lined with handsome homes, and hasn't been leveled, covered with ashes and sprinkled with holy water. The franchise was founded by Wes Craven, the Ray Kroc of horror, who made the excellent \"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\" (1994), about Freddy haunting the dreams of the makers of the \"Nightmare\" movies. Freddy is not a good argument for a supernatural existence. He can live inside wallpaper, appear anywhere and has no need of physical existence, except, arguably, when he inflicts actual physical damage. Yet he's such a bore, always growling away with his deep-voiced hahahahaha. If a man leads an interesting life, he ought to be able to make good conversation, is what I say. I stared at \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response? For Rufus, maybe, but not for me. Here, boy. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "War Dogs", "Review": "\"War Dogs\" is a film about horrible people that refuses to own the horribleness. It's too enamored with its glib arms dealer heroes, and although it's packed with scenes that might have inspired moral whiplash in works like \"Scarface,\" \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\"\u2014to name three superb films about guys who get equally high on drugs and the adrenaline rush of living outside the law, and that \"War Dogs\" references constantly\u2014they're always softened by Hollywood special pleading: Aren't these guys adorable and funny? Don't you love what good friends they are? Don't you admire their audacity? Look at how troubled the hero seems\u2014don't you feel for him? \u00a0 Advertisement Director and co-writer Todd Phillips (the \"Hangover\" trilogy) would seem to be an ideal, or at least promising, person to tell this tale of a couple of pipsqueak Miami arms dealers who make a fortune providing guns and bullets to the US military during the height of the Bush administration's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But \"War Dogs,\" which is based on a Rolling Stone article and a subsequent book by Guy Lawson, lacks the courage of its convictions. Tone-wise, it's all over the map. Sometimes it seems to stare pitilessly at its hero and narrator, former massage therapist and bed sheet dealer turned arms trafficker David Packouz (Miles Teller), and his friend and boss Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), and recognize them as greedy, expedient men who only care about fattening their bank accounts. But other times it seems inordinately concerned with whether David and Efraim will stay pals once things turn south\u2014as if it's a straightforward, un-ironic buddy flick about badass dudes doing badass things, sometimes in slow-motion, instead of a twisted and conflicted parody of that kind of film.\u00a0 Worse, \"War Dogs\" presents David's barely-developed wife Iz (Ana de Armas) as a voice of conscience who's horrified by her husband's lies and furtiveness, never anything more. Whenever the movie concentrates on Iz and David's marriage problems, it confirms its softness. Every time it asks us to care deeply about whether David will lose Iz\u2014who chastises David for his dishonesty, then supports him, then turns against him again, always according to the needs of the plot at that moment\u2014it exposes its sweet-creamy Hollywood center. Henry and Karen Hill these two ain't.\u00a0 Scorsese's \"Wolf of Wall Street,\" which costarred Jonah Hill, drew critical fire (like \"Goodfellas\" and \"Scarface\" before it) for making its wheeler-dealer protagonists as fun to watch as they were morally repulsive; but that was part of the movie's design, and whether you thought Scorsese and writer Terence Winter succeeded or failed, it was obvious that you were supposed to feel torn about the characters and question if you should be having fun watching them get over. It was a variation on the gangster film attraction-repulsion strategy, where you share the hero's power trip fantasy and then feel the sting of reality slapping him in the face. \"War Dogs\" keeps the Scorsesean arrogant-macho banter (which can be very funny, thanks to the relaxed interplay between Hill and Teller) but it loses the ugly undertow that makes non-sociopathic viewers feel slightly dirty for feeling so excited. The detailed breakdowns of the fine points of arms deals come across as a guns-and-ammo version of hedge fund guys bragging about a haul. Advertisement The choice of storyteller is a big part of the film's problem. David, whose real-life equivalent served as a technical advisor and has a cameo, is depicted as nearly as big of a blank as his poor wife. He's a nice guy who was just going about his business when Satan showed up in the form of Efraim, rather than a quick study who ditched his two day jobs and within a matter of weeks was able to manage a soon-to-be-multimillion dollar business built on Beretta pistols and AK-47 shells bought on the cheap and shipped into war zones.\u00a0 The best thing about \"War Dogs\" is the characterization of Efraim, as embodied by Hill. This actor portrays blobby, sarcastic, volatile men better than anyone since the late, great Chris Penn, and he's terrific here, using the character's squeaky laugh as an exclamation point at the end of a tense moment, and letting us see the calculations happening in Efraim's reptilian brain by letting his eyes go cloudy. There are moments where you can spot the exact moment when Efraim decides to betray or destroy someone; often the moment occurs when Efraim is insisting that he's all about loyalty and trust.\u00a0If \"War Dogs\" had put Efraim at its center, it might have gotten closer to its apparent wish to be a scathing, Scorsesean take on arms dealing during the War on Terror\u2014half madcap comedy, half expose. At the very least, it would have inoculated itself against claims that it's a safe film on a dangerous subject. Efraim\u00a0is a slobbish but confident con artist who trudges through life in baggy leisure wear and expensive sunglasses, puffing up his ego with money and guns and telling David, \"I'm not pro-war. The war is happening. This [business] is pro-money.\" At one point he even describes himself to an Iraqi as an \"ugly American,\" frankly claiming a stereotype that he knows he embodies from head to toe.\u00a0 You get the sense that Efraim knows full well what he is but has decided not to worry about it, a scenario that's considerably more chilling than all the scenes of David worrying that Efraim has gone too far but is too good a friend to abandon. Every time Efraim appears onscreen, the audience and the movie have to reckon with him. But \"War Dogs\" chooses instead to hang on David and take his exculpatory narration at face value, as if both Phillips and the audience are as gullible as Iz.\u00a0 Phillips knowingly cites \"Goodfellas\" through various formal techniques (chatty narration, scary-funny violence, freeze-frames) to the point where you pretty much have to buy the idea that David is a twenty-something, 21st century Henry Hill. But \"War Dogs\" doesn't have the bravura visuals and electrifying coldness of Scorsese in gangster-scumbag mode. And you never get the sense, as you do in the best narrated Scorsese films, that the narrator is shading things to make himself seem more glamorous, or less culpable in horror than he actually was (as exemplified in the \"Goodfellas\" scene where Hill calmly describes the ramifications of a mob footsoldier killing a waiter on a whim, but the movie shows us closeups of the character looking appalled and distressed).\u00a0 Advertisement \"War Dogs,\" in contrast, wants us to take David at face value, as a nice guy who made a few mistakes and got in way over his head before coming to his senses but is still basically decent. In the end, he comes off as guilty mainly of loving and trusting his friend, and there's hardly anything in the film to suggest that this might not be the whole story. Efraim, meanwhile, comes across as more of an outrageous, hot-tempered clown than a grubby visionary pig whose lack of education and refinement are eclipsed by a predator's cunning. The film turns him into glorified comic relief, so funny that he can't be properly frightening. Most of the characters in the first \"Hangover\" seemed more disreputable and unpredictable than this guy, and Phillips seemed not to care if we liked them as long as we found them funny and interesting; here he wants us to like his slimy people, too\u2014or at least the film wants us to like David, and root for him to stay friends with Efraim and win back Iz's love. It's a brief in David's defense that sometimes plays as if it was written by David himself."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Think Like a Man", "Review": "Anyone who reads advice books about romance has one problem to begin with: bad taste in literature. The idea that a book can advise a woman how to capture a man is touchingly naive. Books advising men how to capture a woman are far less common, perhaps because few men are willing to admit to such a difficulty. For both sexes, I recommend a good novel, offering scenarios you might learn from, if only because they reflect a lot of doubt. Nevertheless, in 2009, comedian and radio host Steve Harvey wrote a best-seller titled Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What Men Really Think About Love, Relationships, Intimacy and Commitment. This was advice for women. It apparently left some questions, because in 2011, Harvey felt the demand for another book, Straight Talk, No Chaser: How to Find and Keep a Man. A small industry had been set in motion, which inspired Maria Bustillo's Act Like a Gentleman, Think Like a Woman: A Woman's Response to Steve Harvey's Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man (2009). What are Bustillo's qualifications? One month before that book, she published Dorkismo: The Macho of the Dork. Advertisement Among Harvey's qualifications are that he's been married three times, and possibly gained some insights from his two ex-wives about how they failed to keep him. This is not a history to inspire confidence, but in the movie \"Think Like a Man,\" we're expected to believe that every woman in the film bought the book and started living her life according to it. The twist comes when the men in their lives discover their secret reading and study the book themselves. Now the men know the women's game plan.  Starting with its title, this movie must be one of the greatest examples of product placement in history. We see Steve Harvey plugging the book on a daytime talk show, and then he appears again from time to time to deliver advice straight to the audience. It's a promising device for a sitcom, especially as the film assigns the characters to categories from the book, such as \"The Dreamer vs. The Woman Who Is Her Own Man.\" This is somewhat limiting, because each character is required to behave in a way consistent with his or her label. But that isn't the real problem. The movie's mistake is to take the book seriously. This might have worked as a screwball comedy or a satire, but can you believe for a moment in characters naive enough to actually live their lives following Steve Harvey's advice? The result is a tiresome exercise that circles at great length through various prefabricated stories defined by the advice each couple needs (or doesn't need). The cast is superb. It's depressing to find them locked inside this formula. My favorite is Mya (Meagan Good), discouraged by her own promiscuity, who tries to follow the book's advice in dealing with Zeke (Romany Malco). He's a fast-moving ladies' man. She decides he must wait 90 days for sex. This is contrary to both of their natures and builds up such a head of steam, we expect a gasket to blow. Advertisement Kevin Hart is funny, too, as a living rebuke to his pals who are studying the book. He spends most of his time in so-called gentleman's clubs, having 30-minute relationships that all have happy endings, and it's hard to argue he isn't happy. Given that the book advises women about how to capture men, it's an irony that the actresses are among the most beautiful in Hollywood. In addition to Good, it gives us such lovelies as Gabrielle Union, Regina Hall, Taraji P. Henson and Jenifer Lewis. Does it make me a chauvinist if I suggest that finding men must be the least of their problems? The movie is as appropriate for men-seekers as a diet movie starring thin girls. Let's pretend you're a studio executive. Having read this far, did you spot in this review the brilliant title (and premise) for a new comedy? Maybe you skipped right over it. It was: Dorkismo: The Macho of the Dork."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Starbuck", "Review": "\"Starbuck\" is one of those high-concept yet formulaic, sitcom-like comedies that gets by on charm and speed. It is manipulative and\u00a0ingratiating\u00a0ut totally worth your time if you manage to pass one crucial test: Does French-Canadian actor Patrick Huard's smile make you happy? For me, the answer is yes. Huard reminds me of something director Paul Thomas Anderson once said about\u00a0John C. Reilly, that the mere sight of his longtime collaborator \u2014 that genial, rubbery Reilly mug \u2014 makes him smile. Comparisons tend to cheapen things, but what the hell: Mash up Francois Truffaut,\u00a0Daniel Auteuil\u00a0and\u00a0Judd Nelson, and you get Huard's homely/handsome/comical face. It's those kind Truffaut eyes, radiating warmth and passionate concern, that sell this movie's humanist spirit, despite its lack of bite or great surprises. Advertisement Huard plays David, a perpetual screw-up in his early 40's who finds out he is the father of 533 children. See, when he was a young slacker, he made tons of quick cash as a sperm donor\u2014over 600 times. Since he used an alias, Starbuck, 142 of his now-adult offspring are filing a class-action lawsuit to get the sperm bank to divulge their father's true identity.\u00a0 The suit couldn't come at a worse time for David, who is ducking violent loan sharks he owes bigtime, whose girlfriend is pregnant and whose job delivering meat for his father's butcher shop is always imperiled by his complete incompetence. Yep, it's one of those movies, the kind of reality-flavored comic fluff Ho'wood once factory-milled for \"SNL\" alumni every few months, before\u00a0Judd Apatow\u00a0took over the market last decade, adding a bigger dash of improvisatory salt. David emerges as a character who has has been outlawed in movies, a\u00a0lovable\u00a0 guileless fuckup. The fashion in popular films has been more along the lines of \"As Good As It Gets\"-through-\"Silver Linings Playbook,\" where the hero who starts off sour and mentally unstable ends up sloughing off the traumas and disappointments that made him so.\u00a0 \"Starbuck\" is interesting mainly because of its investment in a character who doesn't have to be mean to be interesting. David knows what love is, and that's his problem. He seems to have no concept of time or self-preservation once he gets absorbed in the work of helping somebody whose plight has touched his heart. Screenwriters\u00a0Ken Scott\u00a0and Martin Petit take the safest route through these familiar situations, but director Scott's dynamic staging and tendency to let Huard carry the scenes with screwball aplomb keep us focused on David's universal predicament. Any single man who has found himself suddenly facing the prospect of fatherhood should relate. David's girlfriend knows nothing of his secret Starbuck identity but assumes that he is unfit to raise the one child she knows he's fathered: hers. Unaccomplished and aimless at 42, he seems, in her estimation, certain to go along with her plan to raise the child alone. Advertisement Contrived as it is, the long midsection of the film covering David's awakening to the glories of fatherhood is often unavoidably profound and moving. He gets a dossier containing the identities of all his adult children and goes snooping into their lives. Each stock \"messy\" situation (the drug addict, the dour goth kid, the disabled kid) and proud moment (David discovering he's fathered a soccer star, a musician, an actor and a lifeguard) plays out with all the hugging and learning you'd expect from pre-Larry David\u00a0television dramedy.\u00a0 Yet I found myself awash in the same awkward emotion that accompanied the end of \"Saving Private Ryan.\" Remember when elderly Ryan had a heart-to-heart at the grave of the man who saved his life back in WWII? The mob of descendants lined up behind him in soft focus? It was so transparently mawkish, what\u00a0Steven Spielberg\u00a0was up to in that scene, and yet it was so devastatingly powerful. All those generations of Ryans who simply wouldn't be if not for an unfathomable chain of events \u2014 but also if not for a few clear, moral, compassionate decisions made in faith. \"Starbuck\" has several moments like that, and they are honest ones. Forget about the silly plot; it's all in the eyes."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Stand Up Guys", "Review": "Sometimes it's all about the casting. The notice of a screening came around, I read the names Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin, and it didn't matter in a way what the movie was about \u2014 although it didn't hurt that it was a crime movie.  Apart from any objective ranking of the actors, Walken is a spice in any screenplay, and in \"Stand Up Guys,\" there's room for at least as much spice as goulash. Director Fisher Stevens begins with a permissive screenplay by Noah Haidle that exists in no particular city, for no particular reason other than to give the actors the pleasure of riffing through more or less standard set-pieces. Advertisement Consider first the city. I know where it was filmed, but that information is a distraction. This is a generic city. A city like the city in \"Sunrise,\" which feathers out into shadows and defeat. It is hardly even populated. In a plot that takes the guys into the night and the next morning, the characters seem to be nighthawks, framed by an empty space. They hang out in a diner with hardly any customers, they drive on streets with hardly any cars, and when they visit a brothel, hardly anyone seems to care about sex. That the brothel visit involves Al Pacino with Viagra is inevitable, I guess, and the drug's results are so exaggerated here that physical laws seem to be violated. There is also a wacky chase scene with Alan Arkin transferring more or less from lying a hospital bed to racing behind a wheel of a sports car. And a bad guy named Claphands (Mark Margolis) who exists entirely to fuel the plot. How do you get a name like Claphands? If it's a nickname, how do I know it's not about applause? The set-up involves Val (Pacino) being released from prison and being met on the barren street outside by another former partner in crime, Doc (Walken). They have a history. We see it in their faces. We learn Val has finished a 28-year sentence, served because he was a \u2026 stand-up guy. We learn Val served time for killing Claphands' son. We learn that Doc was at the scene of that murder. There's something else we don't learn right away, but it's there, coiling in the shadows between Doc and Val. It plain doesn't matter how Val killed the Claphands heir, or why. These are plug-on details. What it comes down to is that Doc has been ordered to kill Val, and intends to. Claphands leaves him no choice. But that need not be said yet. Doc has a deadline by which he must commit Claphands' act of vengeance \u2014 a deadline that exists only for the purpose of supplying the film with urgency. If you haven't seen an old criminal crony in 28 years, and you have to kill him, obviously you drill him as soon as possibly convenient. The clock ticks down entirely for the entertainment of the audience and the convenience of the director. Advertisement But no. Doc and Val first have to collect another stand-up guy, Hirsch (Arkin). He was their gang's old driver, now hooked up to oxygen tanks in a hospital. They go to see him, spring him from the hospital, and the plot provides reasons he must drive for them once again. The best reason is that this is an obligatory plot point. So we're given yet one more chase scene. And the movie provides us with subplots involving women. There is the obligatory brothel scene, which observes the rule that before one stand-up guy kills another, they must first bond with sex, as a salute to their old lives. Val's overdose of Viagra has triggered such alarming tumescence that he is rushed to an emergency room. You'd think the brothel would have first-aid measures to treat such a condition, but no. It is a spoiler to tell you one of the hospital nurses, Nina (Julianna Margulies), is Hirsch's daughter. She tells them her dad is in another hospital, which provides two coincidences for the price of one. The other woman is Wendy (Lucy Punch), who inherited the brothel from her mom, who no doubt was the sporting partner of Val, Doc and Hirsch when the stand-up guys didn't use Viagra and stood up on their own. What do the reunited stand-up guys do during their hours between the reunion at the hospital and the death deadline? Cycle through a series of scenes designed to allow these three iconic actors to behave and interact, that's what. Pacino, with the raspy voice of long, low insistence. Walken, who patiently leads others through the logic of the malignant situation he has put them in. Arkin, who talks like the play-by-play announcer during a game with fate. For the rest, there's how the city looks. This is no place for enterprising young men. Every location, we feel, should have one of those London blue plaques, informing the tourist what unspeakable things happened there. These men move through the monuments of sad lives. They have not lost the gift of bitter amusement."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Playing for Keeps", "Review": "\"Playing for Keeps\" tells the story of a has-been soccer star whose career is foundering and his income has hit rock bottom, but who is a completely nice man with none of the character flaws that soccer stars, even Scottish ones, have been known to possess. He doesn't drink too much, his temper is under control, and he's not a skirt-chaser anymore. That's for sure. The plot sets it up so that one beautiful woman after another hurls herself at him. George (Gerald Butler) has settled in Virginia to be near his former wife, Stacie (Jessica Biel), and their son, Lewis (Noah Lomax). One thing leads to another, and George, who we learn in the opening credits was a bona-fide international star player, ends up as the coach of Lewis' soccer team. Advertisement If George's life was eventless before, after he starts coaching, he finds himself all too busy. The grandstands contain not only Stacie but several sexy divorcees and unhappy wives. Consider this all-star lineup: Uma Thurman, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Judy Greer. These middle-aged women are all so sex-starved, they prowl after George with a number of strategies, including straight-out stalking, and in the case of Zeta-Jones, career counseling. She thinks that her connections in Connecticut with ESPN could land George a tryout and maybe a sportscasting job, which would then have the benefit of relocating him to another state and clearing the field of her rivals. What feels decidedly odd during the course of \"Playing for Keeps\" is that George has no apparent response to these repeated seduction attempts. The film makes the reason for that obvious in the fullness of time, and it should be obvious to you as you're watching, but I suppose it ventures into spoiler territory. One thing it isn't is a surprise. That leaves room for comment on the three most important supporting performances. Young Noah Lomax is solid and capable as Stacie and George's son, joining the apparently limitless ranks of gifted child actors. Is there a cutoff age after which young actors lose the gift of seeming spontaneous and natural? Jessica Biel all but steals the show as Stacie, the former wife, now engaged to an apparently swell guy named Matt (James Tupper), who at one point makes a surprisingly generous and kind statement. Stacie is the one character who doesn't seem largely on autopilot and manages to leave room for doubt in a film without much room for that. Then we come to Carl (Dennis Quaid), husband of one of the women in George's fan club, who qualifies as a millionaire bully. He also has a son on the team, gets all puffed up about the fact that that his son has an ex-star for a coach and tips George with a red Ferrari convertible. Quaid uses his sneaky, too-sincere smile, uses his wealth for leverage and is a genuine jerk. So that's good for something, in a film that's pretty much from the assembly line. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep", "Review": "If you can't think of three more endearing recent family movies than \"My Dog Skip,\" \"Babe\" and \"Millions,\" then here's another title to add to the list. \"The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep\" is based on a book by the author of \"Babe,\" made by the director of \"My Dog Skip,\" and stars the hero of \"Millions\" and it fully lives up to its linage. It opens just in the nick of time on Christmas Day, to save parents from having to take the kids to \"Alvin and the Chipmunks.\" The movie, set in Scotland but wonderfully photographed in New Zealand, tells the story of a 12-year-old named Angus (Alex Etel) who finds a curious egg on the beach, brings it home and is astonished to see it hatch a cute little creature with a big appetite. He names it Crusoe and conceals his new pet in the work shed, where it doesn't remain a secret for long, particularly since it seems to double in size every day or so. One day it's terrified by the family bulldog, and a day later the bulldog is terrified by it. Advertisement The time is World War II. Angus lives with his mother Anne (Emily Watson) and older sister Kirstie (Priyanka Xi), and keeps a bulletin board with news and memories of his beloved father, who is away fighting the war. He tries his best to be \"the man of the family,\" per his father's final instructions, and there is another man around, Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chaplin), who helps out with barnyard duties and general repairs. Lewis becomes pals with Angus and Kirstie, and helps them keep the secret of Crusoe from their mother, who might not approve of the pet, especially as it balloons to twice Angus' size, and then three times, and then four times, until it grows so big that there is nothing to be done but move it from the work shed to the nearest large body of water, which is, you guessed it, Loch Ness. We learn the legend of the Water Horse. In all the world, only one is alive at a time. Before it dies, it lays an egg, which will produce the next water horse. As it reaches maturity, it looks like a jolly sea serpent with certain characteristics that remind us of Shrek and E.T., especially in its playful nature, human-like expressions and inadvertent gift for comedy. The farm has been commandeered as a posting for a British artillery unit, charged with placing a submarine net across the mouth of the loch. The unit commander, the supercilious Capt. Hamilton (David Morrissey), seems certain this is where German U-boats will first land on British soil. Some of his men are equally certain that Hamilton drew this cushy assignment as a way of staying out of action. Anne is courted by the slick officer, who goes out of his way to insult Lewis, the man-of-all-work. But all is sorted out with a vengeance, as Angus gradually comes to accept that his father may not be coming home. Like most British family films, \"Water Horse\" doesn't dumb down its young characters or insult the intelligence of the audience. It has a lot of sly humor about what we know, or have heard, about the Loch Ness monster and various frauds associated with it, and fills the edges of the screen with first-rate supporting performance. Imagine a family film with actors the caliber of Emily Watson, Ben Chaplin and Brian Cox as an old-timer who spins stories in the local pub. Will younger kids be a little scared as Crusoe approaches the dimensions of a whale? Maybe, maybe not. Kids seem harder to scare these days, although I'm afraid some of them will find themselves taken to \"Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" which is definitely not for under 13s. What kids will love is Angus' thrilling bareback ride on Crusoe. And viewers of all ages will appreciate that \"Water Horse,\" despite its fantasy, digs in with a real story about complex people and doesn't zone out with the idiotic cheerfulness of Alvin and his squeaky little friends.

{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Cameraperson", "Review": "The collage film \u201cCameraperson\u201d is one of the most original, challenging, sometimes infuriating documentaries of recent times. It\u2019s well worth seeing and arguing about, but only if you can give it your full attention and glean the internal logic that went into its construction. Once you\u2019ve done that, you will never forget what the movie showed you, or your own guesses about why it showed it to you.\u00a0 It\u2019s an extraordinary feeling, meeting a film in this way. The director of \u201cCameraperson,\u201d veteran nonfiction camerawoman Kirsten Johnson, errs on the side of subtlety, which means the movie never comes to you; you always have to go to it. Compounding the difficulty is the reality of moviegoing as most viewers (critics included) often experience it. Anyone who sees \u201cCameraperson\u201d is going to have to set aside a lifetime\u2019s worth of conditioning by word-driven movies that make sure to tell you what\u2019s happening and why it\u2019s important every few minutes, just in case the images and sounds aren\u2019t making things clear. Even though I tend to seek out films like \u201cCameraperson\u201d and give them the benefit of the doubt early on, this film\u2019s first twenty minutes still struck me as opaque to the point of impenetrability, perhaps even a case of the Emperor\u2019s (Empress\u2019s?) New Clothes. The questions that popped into my head aren\u2019t ones that most filmmakers want to hear:\u00a0What am I looking at? Why this moment, and why now? And why are we suddenly done with this moment and moving on to something completely different? Would all of these dazzlingly observed and often flat-out beautiful images have been better served by remaining in their original contexts\u2014projects on which Johnson served as a camera operator? Is this whole thing just a glorified clip reel? Advertisement Nope. It\u2019s going somewhere. And the destination is worth any effort the journey may require. This is the kind of film that makes you see other movies through fresh eyes and ask questions that might not normally occur to you during films that try to hide their storytelling seams.\u00a0 The film begins with footage of Johnson trying to get just the right shot of a shepherd on horseback in rural Bosnia, then continues on to show us scene after scene that seems, on first glance, to be only tangentially connected to everything around it: an old Bosnian woman coyly accepting a compliment on her stylish clothes and indicating that she\u2019s lived a very happy, mostly uneventful life; a young African-American woman in an abortion clinic talking about her decision to terminate her pregnancy; Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, crossing a New York street while telling the camera crew about \u201cthe image of the philosopher who falls in the well while looking at the stars\u201d; a passenger jet\u2019s shadow gliding along the tarmac, as seen through a passenger\u2019s window; Johnson and a director trying to observe the exterior of an Al Qaeda detention facility in Yemen without arousing police suspicion. (\u201cI\u2019ll tell them it\u2019s cinema, it\u2019s a movie,\u201d says the driver\u2019s off-screen voice.)\u00a0 But at a certain point\u2014you\u2019ll know it when you see it\u2014the movie\u2019s narrative strategy clicks into place, and you feel (perhaps before consciously realizing it) that this is not merely a collection of the director\u2019s favorite moments from a career that took her to nations wracked by war, deprivation and oppression, and into her family\u2019s past, and her present as a working mother employed in a field that demands a lot of travel.\u00a0 This is not just one movie, it\u2019s five, maybe six, maybe more, rolled into one.\u00a0 For starters, \u201cCameraperson\u201d is an autobiography of sorts\u2014a life in filmed fragments that almost never shows the face of its main character, Kirsten Johnson, but spends a fair amount of screen time watching her mother succumb to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These heartbreaking moments connect with footage of Johnson\u2019s two children. Watching them grow up, we might wonder if Johnson will one day lose her memory as well, and if these images may one day serve as a substitute for actual, physical memory\u2014the stories that a parent is no longer able to tell a child. We may also notice that the seeming-randomness of this film\u2019s construction is an analogy for how it feels to try to remember a life when one\u2019s mind has been fragmented by disease, or simply by age. Maybe the movie is an analogy for how almost anyone\u2019s mind works, even in mint condition: remembrance is not linear, it jumps around.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cCameraperson\u201d is also an examination of the ethics of documentary filmmaking, particularly where real-life suffering or violence are concerned: What sorts of images are permissible to show? Obviously it depends on the context, but how does one determine context? Are there rules about this kind of thing, or is editing still mainly a matter of rhythm and intuition and common sense? Is the entire process mysterious, or can parts of it be quantified and turned into rules or a code? Are certain acts, certain crimes\u2014particularly war crimes, genocidal campaigns, mass murders and rapes and other large-scale atrocities\u2014diminished through explicit imagery, or is it necessary to inflict distress on the viewer to make the reality feel real?\u00a0 Among other real-life horror shows, Johnson covered the trial of the white supremacists who in murdered James Byrd in Jasper, Texas in 1998; after debating whether to show the filmmakers pictures of Byrd\u2019s corpse, the prosecutors settle for hauling the chain the murderers used to drag Byrd behind a pickup truck. Later, we get a brief look at the truck. This feels like the right approach morally but also tactically (photographs of Byrd\u2019s mangled body would have destroyed the spell that \u201cCameraperson\u201d tries to weave). You might also appreciate the decision to show sites of wholesale suffering as haunted, empty spaces, without cutting to atrocity photos or horrendous news footage: Ground Zero in New York City; the site of a mass rape of Bosnia women by Serbs during the Bosnia War; Nyamata Church in Kigali, Rwanda, where 5,000 Tutsis were murdered by Hutus. But then the movie shows us a graphic scene of an infant enduring a brutally difficult birth in a Nigerian clinic, and we may have the opposite thought: that the blood and suffering helped us appreciate the story and didn\u2019t feel exploitative at all.\u00a0 On a deeper level, \u201cCameraperson\u201d is an examination of storytelling choices\u2014in particular that famous Orson Welles observation that whether a story is happy or unhappy depends on where the storyteller ends it. \u201cDid you always dress with such style?\u201d a filmmaker\u2019s voice asks that elderly woman early in the movie; over an hour later, we hear that same question repeated, and because we\u2019ve been given more information about the woman, her family, her neighbors and her country, we hear it differently, and see through it.\u00a0 Advertisement The various bits and pieces of \u201cCameraperson\u201d collide with one another in smaller, more mysterious ways as well,\u00a0 creating poetic or philosophical effects. Many people, images and ideas that at first felt like mere details\u00a0 assume the significance of metaphor: an Afghan boy who lost an eye; an explanation of how Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder suppresses memory; the way that Johnson\u2019s camera looks away from the faces of individuals in pain and focuses on their hands instead, while making such close-ups feel strangely more intimate than a close-up of teary eyes.\u00a0 A speaker in a \u201cSyrian Dissident Film Collective\u201d tells an audience that when movie focuses on misery and blood, it can excite or numb viewers rather than awaken their empathy. He says filmmakers must \u201cfind a way to represent horror, to represent death, respecting the Golden Rule.\u201d A man in the audience respectfully argues the opposite. The argument remains unresolved, just like every other idea teased out in this unusual film, which is about the things it shows and doesn\u2019t show us, and all the good reasons for showing and not showing, remembering and forgetting."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Music Within", "Review": "I have good things to write about \"Music Within,\" but I have some troubles with it, too. First, the good stuff: This is an entertaining, sometimes inspiring film about a man named Richard Pimental (Ron Livingston), who serves in Vietnam and is almost completely deafened when a shell lands near him in battle. Returning to America, he receives not exactly expert treatment for his disability and is cast out into the world to find himself all but unemployable. Among the friends he makes in the disabled community is Art Honeyman (Michael Sheen), who has cerebral palsy but is a powerhouse of intelligence and wit. Advertisement The two of them experience first-hand the discrimination, sometimes unconscious, that the world inflicts on those who look, sound or act differently. In one of the movie's most infuriating scenes, they are asked to leave a restaurant, \"because you're disturbing the other customers.\" How are they disturbing them? By being there. By existing. By Honeyman being twisted and in a wheelchair and talking awkwardly. Pimental's own experiences and what he sees happening to his friends inspire him to become a disability rights activist, and although the movie doesn't quite say so, he must have been the driving force behind the Americans With Disabilities Act (1990), because no one else is mentioned. Taken just on these terms, the movie works, it's effective, and I believe audiences will respond to it. My own feelings are a little more complex. They began forming in early childhood. Growing up in Urbana, I was unknowingly at the center of a rehabilitation movement that formed after World War II. Thousands of returning vets were in wheelchairs. Unlike Pimental, who is told in the film that he doesn't qualify for veterans' college funds because he is deaf, many of them attended universities on the G.I. Bill. The University of Illinois sits on a landscape flat as a pancake. Ideal for wheelchairs. The Urbana-Champaign community, starting in 1946, began to build ramps into buildings, adapt elevators and washrooms, make curb cuts and equip buses with chair lifts. This was not done overnight, but the town became known as wheelchair-friendly. Our local TV sportscaster, Tom Jones, was in a wheelchair. Our wheelchair athletes, organized in a program by Dr. Tim Nugent, helped launch wheelchair sports. During Vietnam, the loudest anti-war protester on campus was an SDS member named Rudy Frank who walked with so many braces he looked like RoboCop. My photo chief at The Daily Illini was Ken Viste, who was in a chair, but that didn't keep him from working the sidelines at sporting events. Disabled people were no big deal. Things like that were happening all over the country, and I learned a little about them in 1962 when I went along as an aide on a tour of Southern Africa with 18 wheelchair athletes, who demonstrated that life did not end with forms of paralysis. All of this came before Pimental went to Vietnam. The national disability rights movement had many parents. Such men as Robert Burgdorf, Justin Whitlock Dart Jr. and Sen. Bob Dole were instrumental. Remember Ron Kovic, who was born on the Fourth of July? Here in Chicago, my friend Marca Bristo founded Access Living to support the disabled who wanted to live independently. She lobbied relentlessly in City Hall and Springfield. She was appointed chair of the National Council on Disability. No, she didn't create the Americans With Disabilities Act. But Google both her and Pimental, and decide for yourself who played a larger role in the movement. Advertisement What bothers me is that \"Music Within\" takes an individual story, an inspiring one, yes, and then thinks that's all there is to be told. It wasn't one guy who got mad. It was decades of struggle, decades of rejection, decades of streets that couldn't be crossed, stairs that couldn't be climbed, houses that couldn't be lived in and customers who couldn't be bothered. Richard Pimental was more of a beneficiary of the disability rights movement than a pioneer. So why do I give the movie 2\u00bd stars? Because what it does, it does sincerely and fairly well. Just remember that its hero stands for countless others."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates", "Review": "\u201cMike\u00a0and\u00a0Dave\u00a0Need Wedding Dates\u201d confuses repetitive raunchiness with daring humor. It hammers us over the head with the same handful of jokes in hopes of beating us into submission.\u00a0And\u00a0it strains the screen appeal of a group of actors who normally are enormously likable. The film marks the feature-directing debut of Jake Szymanski, who previously directed several segments for \u201cSaturday\u00a0Night Live\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0online shorts for Funny or Die. He shows some strong instincts at the start as he introduces these characters\u00a0and\u00a0sets up this world, but has trouble maintaining the same uproarious energy level for the duration of the film. The script from Andrew Jay Cohen\u00a0and\u00a0Brendan O\u2019Brien, co-writers of the similarly no-holds-barred \u201cNeighbors\u201d movies, is loosely based on a series of actual events, which also inspired a book. But very little here resembles anyone or anything you\u2019d recognize in real life. Advertisement Brothers\u00a0Mike\u00a0(Adam Devine)\u00a0and\u00a0Dave\u00a0Stangle (Zac Efron) really did take out a Craigslist ad to find dates to their cousin\u2019s wedding,\u00a0and\u00a0that ad really did go viral. Here, the cousin has been changed to a younger sister, Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard),\u00a0and\u00a0the wedding has been moved to Hawaii (to up the levels of expectation, ostensibly). In a well-staged opening sequence, which contrasts what\u00a0Mike\u00a0and\u00a0Dave\u00a0recall as delightful family bonding time with the disastrous reality, we learn why everyone wants these guys to bring nice girls to the wedding. They\u2019re a train wreck, albeit a well-intentioned one. They meet their matches in trashy best friends Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza)\u00a0and\u00a0Alice (Anna Kendrick), who are just as much of a hot mess. Tatiana is the wild-eyed, trash-talking alpha of the duo, while Alice is the sweetly perky yet aimless sidekick still reeling from being jilted at the altar. (We\u2019re forced to watch along with Alice as she tortures herself with multiple viewings of the iPhone video of that tragic moment; the repetitious nature of this early, unfunny gag is a harbinger of things to come.) Tatiana\u00a0and\u00a0Alice see\u00a0Mike\u00a0and\u00a0Dave\u00a0discussing their search on TV\u00a0and\u00a0put down the bong long enough to hatch a plan to meet them \u201caccidentally\u201d outside a Manhattan bar. This requires them to clean up\u00a0and\u00a0concoct wholesome back stories for themselves, which amusingly taxes Alice\u2019s ability to tell convincing lies. There is definitely an allure to seeing Kendrick play against type as a bad girl. She was sort of inching in that direction\u2014and\u00a0away from her prim persona\u2014with the original \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movie as a low-key, anti-social DJ. It may not be the most ideal fit for her talent, but it\u2019s still fun to see her stretch. Advertisement The scenes in which she\u00a0and\u00a0Plaza vaguely try to make something of their lives\u00a0and/or sit around on the couch, hoping to convince themselves\u00a0and\u00a0each other of how awesome they are, are the film\u2019s highlights. Tatiana\u00a0and\u00a0Alice are far more compelling than\u00a0Mike\u00a0and\u00a0Dave\u00a0as they co-opt\u00a0and\u00a0upend bro culture. Plaza is game for anything,\u00a0and\u00a0these two likable actresses have an easy, zany chemistry with each other. Then they meet\u00a0Mike\u00a0and\u00a0Dave\u2014and\u00a0in theory, sparks should fly, because Tatiana\u00a0and\u00a0Alice are their female equivalents. But \u201cMike\u00a0and\u00a0Dave Need Wedding Dates\u201d is never nearly as subversive as it thinks it is,\u00a0and\u00a0by the end, everyone tones it down\u00a0and learns to be a grown person. (It\u2019s not exactly a spoiler; these hard-R comedies tend to go soft\u00a0and\u00a0gooey by the conclusion.) We\u2019re supposed to find these guys lovable but they\u2019re actually just adolescent idiots, even though Efron\u00a0andDevine each have been consistently charismatic in the past (with better writing). Devine, the \u201cWorkaholics\u201d co-star, works his fast-talking, manic shtick,\u00a0and\u00a0Efron continues demonstrating his willingness to toy with his pretty-boy persona the farther he strays from the Disney Channel. Despite their efforts, \u201cMike\u00a0and\u00a0Dave Need Wedding Dates\u201d offers raunch with no smarts. It\u2019s not content merely to present increasingly shocking sight gags, such as the thoroughly inappropriate massage the bride receives at the resort\u2019s spa from the naked and\u00a0limber Kumail Nanjiani, a one-note bit that gets dragged out ad infinitum. There\u2019s also the moment when Tatiana reluctantly pleasures the brothers\u2019 bisexual cousin (Alice Wetterlund) in the steam room in exchange for backstage passes to Rihanna (whom the film repeatedly refers to by her nickname, Ri Ri, which is just super edgy).\u00a0And\u00a0then there\u2019s the nude, drug-induced incident involving the horses at the resort\u2019s stables. Showing these events once isn\u2019t enough, though. The movie keeps referring back to them, over and over, as if reminding us about jokes we just saw will make them funny all over again (if they ever were in the first place). Similarly, merely making references to pop culture phenomena does not count as humor, such as an extended (and\u00a0ill-fated) homage to \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d or the acknowledgement of this movie's debt to the superior \u201cWedding Crashers.\u201d And\u00a0then there are the outtakes. Good lord, the outtakes. Don\u2019t we all see through these by now? Sure, it\u2019s a clever way to keep us in our seats during the credits instead of running out to the bathroom, but they are never funny. Here, this is especially true. Hearing crew members cackling in the background doesn\u2019t automatically make these moments hilarious. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Sky", "Review": "When Fabienne Berthaud\u2019s \u201cSky\u201d opens, we\u2019re with a French\r\ncouple in a black Mustang convertible flying across some cinematically\r\nover-familiar scenery in the American West. There\u2019s desert, cactus, blazing sun\r\nand endless sky. Bad rock music blasts on the soundtrack. Her blonde mane\r\nflutters in the wind as she leans back in her seat. She has a camera and they\r\nsometimes stop for her to take photographs. He\u2019s the kind of guy who thinks he\r\nlooks tough, and no doubt does\u2014on the banks of the Seine.  Advertisement These first few minutes suggest a particularly risible kind\r\nof bad European movie: the kind where the characters come to the far West of\r\nthe U.S. and encounter little beyond clich\u00e9s and boorish melodramatic\r\nsituations from the realm of cultural fantasy, much of it of course deriving\r\nfrom a lifetime of watching American movies. Are the French especially prone to\r\nthis kind of unintended silliness? \u201cSky\u201d almost seems determined to prove they are. The thing is, it\u2019s also the sort of awful movie that in some\r\nways isn\u2019t half bad. Its craftsmanship is solid throughout. The acting is\r\ndecent, sometimes better. And it has the advantage of many road movies in that\r\nits constant movement, changes of scene and unexpected twists at least keep you\r\nawake. Better this, you think, than the same nonsense played out over Gauloises\r\nin a cramped Left Bank apartment. The screenplay\u2019s lameness, though, announces itself early\r\non. In a scene that obviously references one in \u201cFive Easy Pieces,\u201d the couple\r\nare at a diner and Richard (Gilles Lellouche) grouses \u201cno ice!\u201d at a waitress\r\nwho brings him a glass of water. It seems to take a long minute for the\r\nwaitress to return with ice-less water. Then, put out that he can\u2019t have eggs\r\nafter 11 a.m., he morosely orders a club sandwich and later bitches to Romy\r\n(Diane Kruger) about the number of dressings he\u2019s offered.\u00a0 (She says she like the choice.) You think: is\r\nthis the best they could do to establish the guy\u2019s Gallic boorishness\u2014blather\r\nabout ice water and salad dressing? Granted, his boorishness soon becomes more blatant. That\r\nnight, Richard gets drunk in one of those archetypal roadside honkytonks that\r\nall movies like this have, and chats up two blonde women. Exasperated, Romy\r\nreturns to their motel room. When Richard comes in, he tries to rape her. She\r\nsmashes him over the head with a lamp and hits the road, sure that she\u2019s killed\r\nhim. Thus does the road movie turn into a solo act. Romy overpays\r\nfor an old clunker and soon ends up in Las Vegas low on cash. Taken in by a\r\nsympathetic aging showgirl (Laurene Landon, in a standout supporting\r\nperformance), she gets a job wearing a bunny costume and selling photos to\r\ntourists alongside two Elvis impersonators. If that conceit sounds about as\r\nlame as ice water and salad dressing, well, so it is. Advertisement Somewhere in here Romy actually says, \u201cI just want to be\r\nfree.\u201d For a half-minute you want to believe her, and await a story that\r\ndetails her journey toward self-determination. But then guess what happens. Of\r\ncourse: she meets a guy. A sexy, long-haired park ranger named Diego (Norman\r\nReedus). He invites her up to his room and offers her two hundred dollars.\r\nSince she\u2019s wearing a bunny costume, he naturally assumes she\u2019s in business. When\r\nshe blushingly insists otherwise, he bluntly tells her he only sleeps with\r\nprostitutes. It avoids the burden of commitment. So Romy exchanges a boorish French lout for a hunky American\r\none who\u2019s relationship-phobic? Well, yes: that\u2019s about the sum of it. The rest\r\nof the story concerns Romy\u2019s returning home with Diego and trying to worm her\r\nway into his life (talk about a thankless task). And this isn\u2019t presented as\r\nany sort of examination of some womens\u2019 penchant for making one bad romantic\r\nmistake after another. In fact, it seems we\u2019re supposed to read Romy\u2019s journey\r\nas somehow worthwhile, even successful: her self-abasement is her self-realization. If that sounds politically very\r\nretrograde, a kind of anti-feminist fable, it comes across mainly as bad screenwriting,\r\nromantic clich\u00e9s imbued with a particularly French kind of cluelessness. As \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d proved, Kruger is a very skilled,\r\ncharismatic actor, and here she carries the movie with some able help from the\r\nlaidback, laconic Reedus. There are also some good performances in secondary\r\nroles from Lena Dunham, Lou Diamond Phillips, Joshua Jackson and Q\u2019orianka\r\nKilcher. Even so, the movie kept reminding me of Albert Brooks in \u201cLost in\r\nAmerica\u201d setting out to bent on \u201ctouching an Indian.\u201d And that was before Romy actually ended up touching\r\none."}

But the real surprise here is Izabela Vidovic as Tremblay\u2019s older sister, who\u2019s been generous enough to allow her brother to be the center of the family\u2019s attention at the expense of her own emotional need. His mom, Isabel (Roberts), put her career on hold to homeschool him from the beginning in the family\u2019s Brooklyn brownstone. But now that Auggie is of middle school age, Isabel and his dad, Nate (Wilson), decide to send him to Beecher Prep so he\u2019ll learn to socialize with other kids and become more comfortable in the outside world. All are understandably apprehensive about this major shift, fraught as it is with the potential for bullying and isolation. And indeed, when his parents walk him to the front gates and send him off on his own for the first time, the kids on campus stop their conversations to gawk and part for him. But Chbosky depicts this event matter-of-factly, allowing the tension of the moment to emerge naturally. There are some familiar figures here: the hip teacher who gives innovative assignments that just happen to coincide with the film\u2019s themes (Daveed Diggs); the mean rich kid who torments him alongside a posse of brutes (Bryce Gheisar); the shy girl who might become an unexpected friend (Millie Davis). But the effortless connection Auggie strikes up with a kid named Jack Will (Noah Jupe)\u2014who also feels like an outsider as a working-class scholarship student\u2014is one of the film\u2019s truest joys, as well as a source of legitimate drama. Advertisement Just when \u201cWonder\u201d seems to be settling into a routine at school, it shifts and revisits that first day from a variety of other characters\u2019 perspectives. So we learn what happened to Auggie\u2019s lonely sister, Via, when she met a cute new boy (Nadji Jeter) and dared to sign up for the high school play. We get a glimpse into Jack Will\u2019s home life, which enriches the significance of his relationship with Auggie. We find out what\u2019s really going on with Via\u2019s lifelong best friend, Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell), who suddenly snubbed her at the start of the school year. As he did with his insightful young adult drama \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower,\u201d Chbosky handles major adolescent events with decency and grace. The cumulative effect\u2014as overly simplistic as it may sound \u2013 is the powerful understanding of what it feels like to walk in someone else\u2019s shoes. The emotion of this enlightenment sneaks up on you in quiet ways. Even Wilson, whose character feels underwritten beyond providing comic relief during moments of family tension, gets perhaps the most heartbreaking, uplifting line in the whole film. You\u2019ll shed a tear or two\u2014especially if you\u2019re a parent\u2014and they\u2019ll be totally earned. All of which makes it so frustrating that \u201cWonder\u201d throws that restraint and goodwill out the window in its finale and turns wildly sentimental. Chbosky cranks up the feel-good with a climax full of wild applause at the most clich\u00e9d place possible: a school assembly. How is it possible that so many cinematic moments of truth take place before a packed auditorium? But the film does so much so well for so long that its pat conclusion feels forgivable. Early on during a screening of \u201cWonder,\u201d when the film first reveals the scars and deformities that mark the hero\u2019s face, my eight-year-old son turned to me and whispered, \u201cHe looks weird.\u201d Once the movie was over, as we were walking out of the theater and I asked him what he thought, he exclaimed: \u201cI loved it!\u201d Such is the film\u2019s transformative power. It is a machine for creating empathy. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Prisoners", "Review": "Kidnapping thrillers often lull us into a sense of safety in the opening sequences, showing the normal rhythms of life that will soon be shattered. Denis Villeneuve's \"Prisoners\" does not go that route. It opens with a shot of a snowy forest, where a deer quietly noses around for food. Into the frame comes the barrel of a shotgun. We hear a prayer being intoned. Boom, the deer goes down.\u00a0The camera pulls back to show a father (Hugh Jackman) and teenage son (Dylan Minnette), in day-glo hunting gear staring at their kill through the ranks of bare trees. On the drive home, the father, who seems humorless, intense, and a bit of a bore, lectures the son on how to always be prepared for the worst in life.\u00a0 Advertisement This opening is so heavy-handed that it's amazing that the film doesn't instantly collapse under its symbolic weight. Shot by the great Roger Deakins, regular cinematographer for the Coen brothers, the movie is drenched in rain and drained of color. Aspects of \"Prisoners\" are effective, but for the most part it's rather ridiculous (despite the fact that it clearly wants to be taken super-seriously), and there's an overwrought quality to much of the acting. Keller Dover (Jackman) is an independent contractor who lives with his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and two kids in a suburban neighborhood. He loves Bruce Springsteen, \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" hunting, and hoarding canned goods, gas masks, and survivalist gadgets in his basement. On Thanksgiving, the Dovers go to dinner with a neighboring family, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis), who have two kids the same age. While the parents drink wine and talk in the living room, the two little girls ask if they can take a walk. It is a walk from which they do not return. Panic ensues, especially when it becomes clear that a creepy RV, which had been seen parked in the neighborhood earlier, has vanished. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case. The RV's owner, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), is dragged in for questioning. Forensics say the RV is clean of physical evidence, but Alex is strange. he speaks in a whispery high voice that makes him sound like a pre-teen. It is not inconceivable to think that he may be hiding something. This is clearly Dover's take, and he and Loki immediately start to butt heads about the course of the investigation. When Jones is released due to lack of evidence (into the custody of his aunt, played by Melissa Leo), Dover takes matters into his own hands, kidnapping Jones, and holding him hostage in an abandoned dilapidated building. Dover loops in Franklin Birch on his plan to beat the truth out of Jones. Birch is horrified at the sight of Jones tied to a sink, but he ignores his own moral compass in the face of Dover's furious certainty. This is one of the subtler points of the script: how certainty can override doubt with sheer force, and how doubt is often essential to maintaining our humanity. \u00a0 Hugh Jackman huffs and puffs and screams and roars throughout the film, and it becomes monotonous, but what all that behavior tells us is that this is a weak man who needs to feel powerful. In one telling moment, while murmuring the \"Our Father,\" he is unable to say \"as we forgive those who trespass against us.\" He has a veritable arsenal in his basement, his family could withstand a mustard gas attack as well as the Zombie Apocalypse, but he couldn't protect his daughter on a simple walk through a safe neighborhood. And he's so convinced that Alex Jones is the guy that he is blind to other possibilities. Meanwhile, his wife lies in bed, tranquilizing herself into a stupor. Advertisement Gyllenhaal is great here in a role that must have looked rather uninteresting on the page.\u00a0Aaron Guzikowski's script, so packed with religious symbols that verges on a sermon, is excellent in its spare and compelling portrait of Loki. The only image of the character outside the context of his job is his introductory scene, eating Thanksgiving dinner in an empty, fluorescent-lit Chinese restaurant as the rain batters down outside. The only thing we learn about his past is that he was in a boys' home and was raised in foster care. His knuckles and neck are sprinkled with tattoos, including a cross on one thumb. He's got a facial tic. We meet a lot of creeps in \"Prisoners\", and you get the sense that Detective Loki could have been one of them if he hadn't become a cop. It's a nice performance from Gyllenhaal, and its subtlety is welcome considering all the teeth gnashing going on in other performances. Director Villeneuve gives us a couple of truly suspenseful scenes. One is a chase through the nighttime back yards of the neighborhood after a candlelight vigil for the two girls. The interiors of the houses seem gloomy and cramped, with walls cutting into the frame and characters coming in and out of sight: a visual correlative for the idea of people cut off from one another. But as the plot goes into high gear and we get other suspects, basement lairs and a glimpse of vast conspiracies, \"Prisoners\" wears out its welcome."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "I'm in Love with a Church Girl", "Review": "\"I'm in Love with a Church Girl\" is one high-gloss Christian movie. In the opening scene, prison guards stroll cell blocks gleaming with a godly light, piercing the glittering beams and thin blue ribbons of lens flare as they go. It's miraculous, the way timeless photographic technique and digital tools can now create downright confectionary images.  This movie stays beautiful as it follows the courtship between a wealthy drug dealer and a nice Christian girl. Jeff \"Ja Rule\" Atkins looks handsome as the dealer, Miles; Adrienne Bailon is adorable and personable as the girl, Vanessa. They meet at the home of a mutual friend and hit it off right away. Whether lounging in Miles' palatial mansion or going out to dinner at an upscale restaurant, Miles and Vanessa have a warm, flattering light to bask in.  Advertisement The cinematographer of this film is named Keith J. Duggan. The production designer is Douglas Freeman. They do lovely work here.  Galley Molina wrote the film based on his inspiring life story. Like his protagonist, he once earned a great living trafficking drugs but eventually got out of the game thanks to the influence of a young woman whose love of the church became infectious. \"It took a pretty woman to bring me around,\" Molina has said of his redemption. He wrote the story while in prison for drug charges\u2014a result of an indictment carried out long after he had reformed. This film amounts to a demonstration of how to handle the burden of past sins when they come home to roost. It's also about surrendering to faith, letting God take charge of one's life.  As such, \"I'm in Love with a Church Girl\" is a primer for Christians and potential Christians. What it isn't, if you don't fall into either of those categories, is watchable. Under Steve Race's direction, the performances are uniformly poised, polite and mechanical.  Every interaction either plods or just sits there as the actors recite Molina's straightforward dialogue like trade show spokesmodels for a Christian-themed hair product.  Moments of chemistry between Atkins and Bailon alleviate some of the dullness, and the way they hold certain gorgeously composed close-ups suggests amazing possibilities in better movies. There just isn't enough to justify a feature-length narrative.  Molina's story is worth telling. I suspect that, in this form, it will reach some of the at-risk youth who are clearly his target audience. But for myself and most folks expecting a movie, it is too transparent an infomercial for the church to move the mountain."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Boo! A Madea Halloween", "Review": "Five years ago, my RogerEbert.com colleague Steven Boone and I wrote a very long online piece on Tyler Perry. Neither of us sought to dismiss him, and I expressed much admiration both for how he built his own studio and for how brilliant actresses of color trusted him so passionately with their performances. But I found his direction to be extremely problematic. For example, there were moments in \u201cFor Colored Girls\u201d where Perry was as bonkers and fearless as Sam Fuller, but he could never seal the deal in the visual way the cinematic medium needed.\u00a0 Advertisement As for Perry\u2019s most famous character, Madea, I\u2019ve always thought she worked better on stage, where her broadness plays to the back of a theater filled with fans expressing fellowship and jonesing on the Christian music and message of the plays.\u00a0Unlike many of Madea\u2019s prior movies, \u201cTyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween\u201d didn\u2019t originate as a hit stage play. The idea started as a joke in Chris Rock\u2019s hilarious \u201cTop Five,\u201d where the latest Tyler Perry production has Madea fighting ghosts. Despite the mockery, Perry liked the concept and shot this movie\u00a0in 6 days. The idea of a supernatural addition to Madea\u2019s litany of pet peeves intrigued me. I would have enjoyed seeing her cuss out demons and slap the taste out of the mouths of disrespecting spirits. Unfortunately, the only supernatural aspect of \u201cTyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween\u201d is the \u201cboo\u201d in the title. Instead, the plot concerns itself with Madea (Tyler Perry) trying to keep her great niece Tiffany (Diamond White) from attending a Halloween party at the lamest fraternity I have ever seen. When things go horribly awry for the frat, they plot a Halloween-themed vengeance on Madea and her cohorts Aunt Bam (Cassie Davis), Hattie (Patrice Lovely) and Joe (Tyler Perry). Madea\u2019s nephew Brian (Tyler Perry, again) summons her to his house to keep an eye on his daughter while he\u2019s out of town. He fears she will disobey his orders and attend the frat party. Brian is a doormat whom Tiffany disrespects in ways that would never fly in a Madea-run household. Tiffany\u2019s behavior becomes the basis for the typical whiplash-inducing dramatic change in tone for which Perry\u2019s films are notorious. Before we get there, however, we have to deal with the party, the pranks and the constant bickering between Madea and her crew. Advertisement I wish Perry had spent the time to craft some good scares, even if they\u2019re supposed to be comedic. The trailer pretty much covers everything you\u2019ll see in terms of Halloween-themed material. The entire frat subplot is Perry\u2019s attempt to bring in a younger crowd (he casts several Youtube sensations), but outside of the moment when the elderly Hattie twerks to a Tyga song, these scenes are almost unwatchable. A scene with the frat inside a school bus is especially awful, offensively trotting out gay panic tropes that Perry unsuccessfully plays for laughs. \u201cTyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween\u201d fares better when it focuses on Perry\u2019s broadly played cast of older characters.\u00a0Joe, Aunt Bam and Hattie are good for several chuckles, though their director often beats their gags into the ground. Joe\u2019s extremely gruesome descriptions of the corporal punishment he dispensed on his son, Brian, provides some squirmy, scary laughs. And Madea is at her funniest when she\u2019s being unforgivably mean; her takedown of a trick-or-treater dressed like a cow is hilarious in its unflinching cruelty. Her line about having a \u201cHo-oh-one-K\u201d instead of a 401(k) made me laugh so hard I embarrassed myself. At 103 minutes, this film has way too much dead weight. Scenes are repeated over and over, and some of the acting would not cut it in a school play. But in the rare moments when \u201cTyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween\u201d is firing on all cylinders, it displays a cleverness which hints that, with more time and a few more iterations of the script, this might have been a good movie. For the most part, the film has a rushed, haphazard quality that makes it feel like a selfish cash grab by its creator. But I know better; Perry\u2019s love for his audience radiates off the screen and is returned just as powerfully by his fans. The real problem isn\u2019t that he\u2019s preaching to a built-in choir, it\u2019s that the choir too easily forgives cinematic trespasses like this. That\u2019s the Christian thing to do, I suppose, but I\u2019m going to be a heathen here.\u00a0Madea would understand. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Not Yet Begun to Fight", "Review": "Marine Colonel Eric Hastings, a quiet man of wide smile and thin hair, stands knee-deep in a whispering river, several decades and thousands of miles removed from the brutal chaos of the Vietnam war. As head of the group \u201cWarriors and Quiet Waters,\u201d he now brings damaged young veterans of more recent conflicts to his Montana ranch in hopes that the tranquility of fly-fishing will help relieve their stress disorders. In this touching documentary, the wounds of the past are soothed by flowing waters. Advertisement These are men of broken body. Until the camera moves, we would not know, because they seem frank and reflective, with no indication of damage. But, almost every participant is missing an eye, or leg, or more. Then, as they speak, we notice some awkwardness in their conversation. Some remember the blasts that shattered them. Others remember their hospital beds. One paraplegic warrior, in a deadpan tone, narrates a list of his injuries, seen in jump-cuts.  A Navy Seal with steel eyes speaks through his iPad's computer voice, typing long sentences with one finger. When he plays his message, he remains in a posture of meditation for long moments after his text runs out. As he silently struggles through frustrating rounds of rehabilitation, learning to walk with a prosthetic leg, we wonder how many stories his frozen expression hides. But he finds light in the support of his wife of seven months. There are, however, others whose afflictions are hidden from us. A reserved man in sunglasses and collared shirt looks like a forty-year-old employee of the ranch. But, he is only 28, former bomb technician who lived on adrenaline. When his trainer apologizes for touching him, we anticipate some serious revelations about his deep wounds. He compares his six-year Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to a leech that slowly crept up on him until it started biting. Now he keeps his distance from people, trying not to recall the vile, disgusting violence he associates with all humanity. At the ranch, he accepts that there people in the world who do care for veterans like himself. Soon, he is able to accept their hugs. These are men of broken soul. The hope of Quiet Waters is that the patient, careful fly-fishing repetitions will teach the vets new, healthy behaviors, dissolving away harmful old habits. But Colonel Hastings does not let them hang on to their conquests: When a soldier catches a fish, he can celebrate, but he has to return the creature to its waters. The point is, these fighters know bloodshed too well; now Hastings teaches them to value life itself. The quiet Montana sky, lush forests, and distant mountains also help. Nevertheless, those grins from catching fish are captivating and priceless. Advertisement Movies often tell us about the camaraderie of soldiers. Here, despite their wounds, some of these soldiers long to return to service. One wounded warrior in eye-patch believes he is perfectly designed for deployment. He longs to return to Afghanistan. Another soldier feels himself responsible for his unit members' deaths. Hastings explains that a person will not ever get past those feelings, and must learn to live despite them. And go fly-fishing. Perhaps fly-fishing gained most prominence in Robert Redford's \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d While \u201cNot Yet Begun to Fight\u201d might lack the beautiful cinematography of that film, it still manages to capture the serene terrain above and below water. In Redford's film, the main character felt constrained by the forced precision of the process. Here, though, the goal is freedom from a deep prison. Running only an hour, this documentary is as emotionally heavy as almost anything twice as long. Watching the soldiers in life beyond the group, we feel joy learning of some of their successes, along with the pains of their disappointments. As we watch Colonel Hastings, we cannot help but feel for him. His eyes well as he sympathizes with these young men. Occasionally, he sheds tears of gratitude watching them accomplish their small, but meaningful victories. With the grace of a cellist, he swings his own fishing pole back and forth. He soon catches a fish with his bare hands, caresses its body and tail, and lets it swim away."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Wild Life", "Review": "Daniel Defoe's \"Robinson Crusoe,\" published in 1719, was an instant best-seller, and ran through many editions. The book has \"lived\" for 297 years at this point, with no fallow period where it dropped into obscurity, an incredible feat for any novel. The book has sparked conversation and argument for centuries. Jean Jacques Rousseau loved it. Jonathan Swift hated it, and \"Gulliver's Travels\" is clearly a satirical and vicious counterpoint. James Joyce referred to Robinson Crusoe as \"the true prototype of the British colonist,\" a valid criticism. There have been many film versions, dating to the beginning of cinema. There have also been many novels that tell the story from the point of view of a secondary character. And now comes \"The\u00a0Wild Life,\" an animated film from the Belgian animation studio nWave, co-directed by Vincent Kesteloot and Ben Stassen, which tells the Robinson Crusoe story from the point of view of the adorable close-knit group of animals who live on the island where Crusoe finds himself shipwrecked. Advertisement \"The\u00a0Wild Life\" is a loose adaptation (no cannibals, no slave trade), and suggests (humorously) that Crusoe perhaps was not the paragon of self-reliance that his reputation claims. The film tries to pack in a little bit too much in its running time, and there isn't a comedic moment until well into the film, a strange choice in a movie for kids, but \"The\u00a0Wild Life\" has its moments of charm, hilarity, and slapstick that worked really well at the 2D screening I attended, a screening packed with kids. (\"The\u00a0Wild Life\" will be released in both 2D and 3D.) Before Crusoe's arrival, the island is an untouched paradise. The animals live together, gather food together, and get each other out of scrapes. The leader is Mak (David Howard), a colorful parrot who senses a wide world is out there beyond the ocean and he wants to see it. There's a sassy emotional tapir (Laila Berzins), a chameleon with a formal Shakespearean voice (Colin Metzger), a squeaky-voiced kingfisher (Lindsay Torrance) who wishes Mak would be happy where he is. A couple of other creatures\u2014an echidna, a blind goat\u2014round out the group. When a ship crashes into the island during a terrible storm, and a gangly man and his dog emerge onto the shore, the animals peek at him from their perches, fascinated. They think he's a new species and find him vaguely terrifying. Mak, though, feels vindicated. He always knew that the island wasn't all there is! Crusoe (Yuri Lowenthal) begins his struggle for survival, and the animals make tentative advances. Before you know it, the animals help him build his treehouse and his lookout tower, problem-solving and working together, and Crusoe's created world has become a Utopia, an ideal society. Unfortunately, two scrawny cats (Debi Tinsley, Jeff Doucette) have also emerged from the shipwreck, and crouch from the cliffs above, looking on the happy communion below, vowing to get their revenge on ... anyone who is happy. The cats sneer and scheme like the Macbeths, the \"wife\" a murderous powerhouse, egging on her more reluctant (and, in the film, stupid) \"husband.\" The cats are agents of chaos and destruction, interrupted only by the wife giving birth to a litter of unpleasant villainous kittens. The film features some pretty violent moments against those cats: they are thrown across a room on the ship, thrown down the stairs ... it's actually rather brutal, whether they are villains or not. Advertisement Crusoe names Mak\u2014with whom he has the strongest bond although they cannot understand one another's language\u2014\"Tuesday\" (a nod to the book, where Crusoe named his servant \"Man\u00a0Friday,\" a term, of course, that has entered the lexicon). The cats' urge to dominate the island is a bit of a bore, although it pays off in a gigantic group fight later in the film, Crusoe's animal-friends against the cat-couple's endless offspring, who keep coming from every corner. The movie includes some violent images that may be a bit too real for little kids: Crusoe points a musket right at the camera during target practice, he gets axes whipped at his head by pirates, and is slapped\u2014hard\u2014across the face a couple of times while hanging upside down. Violence like this is totally unnecessary in a movie geared for the six-year-and-under set. The slapstick violence that makes up the final standoff between Crusoe's animal-team and the cats is funny, with a harmless Looney Tunes panache, where you don't spend much time worrying about the harm done to the Road Runner. The animation is beautiful, with star-crowded night skies, ferocious storms, blazing sunsets, Crusoe's lookout tower hovering in the dark air above the ocean, and then, later, impressive and thrilling circular shots taking us down through Crusoe's impressive treehouse, his makeshift water pipes, through convoluted cave passageways. There's always a lot to look at. The script (Lee Christopher, Domonic Paris, Graham Welldon) is so-so, but the total lack of snark and cynicism in the film is refreshing."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Son of Joseph", "Review": "The story of theater and film artist Eug\u00e8ne Green sounds like that of a character made up by Umberto Eco or Gilbert Adair. Born in New York in the late 1940s, he decamped to Paris while still a young man. Once settled in Europe, he made his life work the revival of the traditions of Baroque French theater, particularly a declamatory style of direct address. He\u2019s mounted many plays, published many books. He has been compared to the conductor Nikolaus von Harnoncourt, a pioneer in the \u201coriginal instruments\u201d movement of playing classical music. But his pursuit and championing of baroque modes does not end at traditional forms. He has been making films since the turn of the century, many of them parables that extol old-world values in modern settings.  Advertisement His new picture \u201cSon of Joseph,\u201d opens with credits on white type against a black background, some stirring Baroque choral music, and shots of schoolkids\u2019 feet as they leave their building. A title card announces the movie\u2019s first chapter, \u201cThe Sacrifice of Abraham.\u201d In a basement, a couple of teen boys\u2014they were among the schoolkids, we infer\u2014have trapped a rat, and they\u2019re holding it in a cage, prodding it with rods and saying mean things to it. (This is the most unpleasant imagery in the whole movie and press materials insist the rat was unharmed and has retired from acting.) One of them asks \u201cWhere\u2019s Vincent?\u201d We next see the kid who opted not to partake in rat torture. He is Vincent, surly, fresh-faced, tormented. He shoplifts a screwdriver from a hardware store, and immediately brings it back. He has a tortured relationship with truth. After he snoops into his mother\u2019s desk to find correspondence that reveals the identity of his father, who\u2019s been absent his whole life, he readily admits to his mother that he did it. She slaps him and he takes it. But he then crashes a party hosted by his father, the top editor at a major publishing house, and tells a ditzy literary critic in attendance that he\u2019s that editor\u2019s latest enfant terrible find. What does Vincent want? Well, he wants a family. On encountering a happy male/female couple sitting at a caf\u00e9, he glowers at them; the camera tilts up to show the name of the caf\u00e9 is \u201cPere et Fils.\u201d One of his rat-torturing buddies offers him a business proposition. \u201cI sell sperm on the Internet,\u201d pal Dean tells Vincent. \u201cWho\u2019s your supplier?\u201d Vincent asks. \u201cI am,\u201d says Dean, sighing. \u201cBut supplies are limited.\u201d Almost all the signifiers in the early part of the picture are about parenting, reproduction. And, of course, the unusual nature of what it is to be related to someone, either by blood or humanity. The circumstances mess with the super-serious Vincent to the extent that they compel him to invade the sparsely-furnished hotel suite that serves as his wayward father\u2019s office. There, he role-reverses the sacrifice of Abraham by handcuffing his father to his chair and holding a blade to his throat. At which point he is met with a vision.  Did I mention this movie is a comedy? It is, and a very sure-footed one, although the style does take some getting used to. Between the meticulously composed framing\u2014 sometimes breaking down bodies to their component parts, sometimes privileging the talking head\u2014and the clear, deadpan delivery of the dialogue, one might be tempted to say that Green accomplishes the not-as-unlikely-as-it-sounds fusion of Bresson and Kaurismaki. But this would be inaccurate, because \u201cSon of Joseph\u201d doesn\u2019t actually feel like a fusion or pastiche. Green is on to his own thing, and while it takes some getting used to, it ultimately provides big rewards both in entertainment (I found it reliably warm and funny) and Stuff with a Capital S (its adaptation and elaboration of Biblical themes posits some worthwhile moral propositions).\u00a0 Advertisement Green\u2019s magnificent cast is another big plus. Young Victor Ezenfis, as Vincent, can go from irritating to endearing without actually seeming to change a thing about his bearing. The great Natacha R\u00e9gnier is a warm and credible mother Marie. The very great Mathieu Amalric reins in his bug-eyed madness but still registers strongly as the arrogant but harebrained book man Oscar Pormenor. Maria de Medeiros is hilarious as a daintily pretentious literary critic. And Fabrizio Rongione, the Belgian actor who\u2019s a veteran of the work of the Dardenne brothers (who co-produced this film) and starred in Green\u2019s last film, \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d is almost as beatific as Regnier in the role of Joseph, the man Vincent chooses to be his new dad. I won\u2019t spoil the ending\u2014although you can probably guess some of it\u2014but it\u2019s as enigmatic and strangely satisfying as many of this unique film's best scenes."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Anna", "Review": "If the surreal dreamscapes that propelled \"Inception\" had taken place in the deep, dark and dubious recesses of a disturbed adolescent girl\u2019s mind, it would look a lot like \"Anna.\" It's as messy as a teen\u2019s bedroom and packed with all manner of distracting clutter that needlessly burdens a plot. This psychological thriller concerns a so-called memory detective, John Washington (played by Guy Ritchie regular Mark Strong, a rugged Jason Statham type but with more soul and less scowling), who can remotely view the flashbacks of his subjects and brilliantly deduce details about their cases. But he has been off his game after suffering a stroke during a session gone awry. That\u2019s on top of grieving over the suicide of his wife. Advertisement After a two-year break and depleted funds, he agrees to enter the mind of Anna (Taissa Farmiga, a formidable presence who looks like a mini-me version of older actress sis Vera), a 16-year-old who is both \"gifted\" and \"haunted,\" as we are so informed.

Her doubting stepdad (her father died before she was born) appears to be having an affair with the housekeeper (who, for some reason, wears a French maid\u2019s outfit straight out of a Halloween catalog) and would control Anna\u2019s inheritance if she is sent away for treatment. Meanwhile, her caring mom drowns her disappointments with drink. As we tag along on the journeys into Anna\u2019s past, we see possible triggers, including such images as being locked into a closet and bleeding while holding a dripping letter opener. But more troubling is John\u2019s discovery, after doing some actual research, that a teacher had taken inappropriate photos of her and that a fellow student has accused her of a vicious attack. The saving grace of Anna is the cool, calm and collected air that Strong and Farmiga maintain as he struggles to unearth the truth. Yes, this is a cat and mouse game, a battle of wills where we are to think that the rodent might be in charge. The two actors, who each possess a magnetic screen presence, make for intriguing foils as they challenge one another. However, it is hard to believe that it takes so long for Strong\u2019s character to even question Anna\u2019s motives, even after the audience does, despite any sympathetic feelings he might have for her as a fellow victim of a damaged psyche. For a supposedly ace sleuth of the subconscious, John is oddly unsuspicious, especially when it appears that Anna might be more fond of him than she should be. Advertisement Even more disappointing, instead of any effects that are truly special given the visual opportunities this premise offers, Spanish director Jorge Dorado leans heavily on repeating certain thematic symbols over and over, presumably providing clues, or maybe red herrings, that instead only prove confusing. There is water\u2014rain storms, the sea, tap water overflowing out of tubs and basins, showers, flooded floors; stairs, especially the massive spiral one in Anna\u2019s home. The splashes of the color red materialize on lips, roses, blood, rugs and Anna\u2019s sketches. And clocks\u2014along with a metronome\u2014complete with nervous ticks and tocks. But even with such tricks as quick cuts, shadowy figures, distorted sounds and images, nothing really gets under your skin.\u00a0 \u00a0 And, save for the two leads, the performances of the rest of the cast\u2014including, most surprisingly, the usually commanding Brian Cox as John\u2019s boss\u2014are not much better than Lifetime Channel level. What is most frustrating is that Dorado denies us any real element of surprise or revelation as he exposes the pieces of his muddled puzzle. \"I\u2019m not a sociopath,\" Anna claims. \"Just smart enough to think like one.\" If only \"Anna\" the movie were that smart, too."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit", "Review": "\"Where everything is bad, it must be good to know the worst.\" The British philosopher F.H. Bradley wrote that, and while he was surely not referring to the relative glut of bad movies that American distributor dump into theaters during the six-to-eight week winter/awards season lull at the beginning of each year, such is the state of things that while it may indeed be good to know the worst, it's kind of difficult to tell. There's also a kind of inverse correlative possible: with so much bad, how can you tell what's good?  Advertisement On the face of things, a studio reboot of the late writer Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character, a sort of American James Bond for the neocon/family values set, seems like an opportunistic and banal idea. And for the first minutes of \"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,\" which rewrites the Ryan origin story by placing the young character in the London School of Economics for the terror attack of 9/11, opportunism and banality go hand in hand with nary a care in the world, it seems. Things get less blithe, and a little shaky, when appealing, square-jawed, eagle-eyed Chris Pine's undercover C.I.A. fiscal analyst Ryan is pairing off romantically with what seems to be a severely miscast Keira Knightley, who, try as she might, doesn't quite make it as a wholesome, uncomplicated young American woman of substantial backbone. So my question during the initial part of the movie was, \"Just how bad will this be?\"  But then something interesting (and pretty rare) happens: the movie finds its feet, and unrolls as a pretty suspenseful, largely engaging, and hardly ever too-over-the-top spy thriller. Once Ryan finds himself in Moscow, investigating what looks to him like a conspiracy to sink the U.S. dollar (you can tell this movie is a fantasy because as the plot proper unfolds one character refers to our native currency's \"strong performance\"), the ex-Marine finds himself back in action, and a fight scene that quotes purposefully from both \"From Russia With Love\" and \"Torn Curtain\" gets the adrenaline up. The presence of Russian villains suggests a certain Cold War nostalgia, at least as far as plot-point potential is concerned, on the part of screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp. On the other hand, maybe they're just spy movie classicists.\u00a0In any event, director Kenneth Branagh casts himself as one of them, and boy does he have a devil of a time playing chilly, drug-addicted psychopath financier Viktor Cherevin. (Mikhail Baryshnikov also seems to enjoy his role as an old-school Kremlin cardinal.) Also adding a good deal of juice is a straight-backed, just-offhand enough Kevin Costner as Ryan's spymaster. After Knightley's curious Cathy follows Ryan to Moscow and obliges him to blow his cover (I assume you're all familiar with the covert-C.I.A.-agent-drill in Popular Cinema by now), it's all in for a quasi-\"Mission Impossible\" style breach of Cherevin's corporation (whose logo bears a striking resemblance to that of Enron, oddly enough), to stop not just a fiscal disaster but a new terrorist attack on American soil. Yes, the movie does pack in a lot of plot, and as you may have inferred, much of said plot is pretty derivative (the talk early on of a controversial oil pipeline will ring \"The World Is Not Enough\" bells for spy movie mavens). Derivative doesn't mean dumb, though (okay, it doesn't mean \"too dumb\"), and what the movie lacks in originality the cast and the director make up for in sheer let-us-entertain-you enthusiasm. Knightley eventually finds her footing\u2014largely when she's left alone with Branagh, and their respective characters can cagily chat about Lermontov, as British thespians so often do among themselves. And while the movie does eventually trot out the too-common commonplaces of the damsel in distress and the ticking time bomb for the climax and grand finale, it plays those tropes with what passes for discretion in contemporary action movies. In short, a spy movie that will satisfy if you happen to be in the mood for one. Which in January constitutes something of a minor miracle.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Novitiate", "Review": "\u201cI\u2019m in LOVE, Mom!\u201d a teenager cries out to her mother with a heady mix of girlish giddiness and adolescent angst. But the object of her affection isn\u2019t a boy, or even another girl. It\u2019s God, and her ardor is powerful enough to drive her to devote her life to Him as a nun. Writer/director Margaret Betts explores this mystical passion in \u201cNovitiate,\u201d her thematically ambitious, technically-precise feature debut. A movie about nuns in the '60s may not sound exciting. It may not even sound vaguely intriguing. But Betts wisely depicts these young women as individuals who contain multitudes, even within such a structured setting. They\u2019re full of contradictions as they figure out who they are and what their place is in the world\u2014just like any young woman in any walk of life. These teenage girls, however, have chosen to dedicate themselves to God\u2014to marry Him, as they say in the vernacular, which includes donning a white gown and veil and taking vows. It\u2019s a decision Betts portrays with open-heartedness and without judgment, an unusual and admirable feat in a film about organized religion. Advertisement And yet there\u2019s something exotic about this sacred realm: a sheltered, silent convent where stone walls, immaculate grounds and rigid rules can only contain secrets for so long. \u201cNovitiate\u201d explores what happens when the girls\u2019 natural sexual urges begin to bubble up\u2014for men they\u2019ve not yet met, for each other, for God Himself\u2014and how they clash with the inherent chastity of their calling. It\u2019s a time of flux for the Catholic Church, though. \u201cNovitiate\u201d takes place just as the changes of Vatican II are going into effect throughout the world\u2014radical, liberal shifts in ideology that are meant to foster openness and inclusiveness, but which fly in the face of hard-liners\u2019 long-held beliefs and practices. As the Reverend Mother\u2014a cruel leader who hasn\u2019t set foot outside the convent\u2019s gates in 40 years\u2014Melissa Leo is chilling and often deliciously over the top. She intends to run things the way she always has, with an iron hand and a raging temper, and finds it increasingly difficult to do so. Her young postulants\u2014who aspire to become novitiates before taking their finals vows\u2014aim to please her every step of the way, but they also undergo moments of questioning and doubt. We endure this demanding experience with them through the eyes of Cathleen (Margaret Qualley in a star-making performance), the aspiring nun who proclaims her love for God at the film\u2019s start. At first, her choice seems like an act of rebellion against her single mother, a profane, chain-smoking atheist. Julianne Nicholson is excellent as always in the role, a no-nonsense spitfire and voice of reason whose brashness cuts through a deliberately-paced film that can be quiet and restrained to a fault. As Cathleen gets further into her training, though, she finds the strength of her faith repeatedly tested. Reverend Mother warns the girls from the get-go that she\u2019s \u201cthe voice of God\u201d on Earth, and that hard work awaits them. She\u2019s R. Lee Ermey from \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d in a floor-length habit, sadistic and manipulative as she separates the wheat from the chaff. Cathleen\u2019s devotion manifests itself in primal ways, a potentially shocking notion that Betts depicts with understated intimacy. Betts\u2019 camera does wonders with Qualley\u2019s open, expressive face. And she remains tasteful in her approach as the arduousness of the training steadily takes its toll on Cathleen, body and soul. Again, though, hers is but one experience.\u00a0 Advertisement Rather than indicting the church itself, Betts seems more interested in exploring what drives these girls on the brink of adulthood to pursue such a rigorous spiritual quest\u2014and what prompts some of them to abandon it. As Sister Evelyn, Morgan Saylor gives a wrenching monologue during a ritual in which she\u2019s forced to examine her faults before the Reverend Mother and her fellow novitiates; conversely, Dianna Agron provides a much-needed source of warmth as the girls\u2019 trainer, who embraces Vatican II\u2019s changes at her own peril. \u201cNovitiate\u201d finds room for all these viewpoints; appreciating the dedication it takes to live such a life while also questioning its suppression of individuality and emotion. This willingness to embrace such complexity is a bit of a miracle in itself."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "The Babymakers", "Review": "Comedies about sperm are not high on my list of favorites. Although I am aware sperm is a precious bodily fluid, I don't find it an especially funny one, and when a character spills half of the deposits in a sperm bank and then slips around on the floor like a clown on ice, I'm not laughing. I'm thinking, \"yuck!\" Millions of little soldiers being massacred for a laugh. The worst sperm bank movie I've ever seen is \"Frozen Assets\" (1992), of which I wrote: \"If I were more of a hero, I would spend the next couple of weeks breaking into theaters where this movie is being shown, and leading the audience to safety.\" This movie is not quite that bad, which isn't saying much. Advertisement The film stars the blameless Paul Schneider and Olivia Munn as Tommy and Audrey, a married couple who are around 30. She feels her clock is ticking, but try as they will (and they do), she doesn't get pregnant. A doctor gives her a clean bill of health but finds that Tommy has \"lazy sperm,\" possibly because it hasn't been doing its pull-ups. Tommy thinks he knows why this cannot be true. Years ago, when he was trying to raise money to buy an engagement ring for Audrey, he sold many deposits of his own sperm to a local sperm bank, whose experts had no problems with it. What could have gone wrong since then? Would it have anything to do with Tommy's unfortunate tendency to get himself kicked in the groin? The movie pulls no punches in showing his groin being pummeled mercilessly. Some guys just have bad luck. I've never found kicks to the groin particularly funny, although recent work in the genre of the Buddy Movie suggests audience research must prove me wrong. After finding the sperm bank doesn't allow withdrawals, Tommy and his buddies Wade and Zig-Zag (Kevin Heffernan and Nat Faxon) conceive a desperate scheme to break in and steal his old sperm. To help them in their plan, they enlist a member of the \"Indian Mafia\" (Jay Chandrasekhar, the film's director). Breaking into the bank, they have their difficulties with the slippery floor and also with Officer Malloy (M.C. Gainey). They've attracted his attention by acting as suspiciously as it is probably possible for guys to act while skulking about at night. What increases the icky quotient of \"The Babymakers\" is that Chandrasekhar and his writers, Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow, are not content to make a standard vulgar raunch fest. No, they also want to melt our hearts by making the marriage between Audrey and Tommy sweet and touching. The movie's switches between the crude and the sentimental become pathological, as if someone stood up at a wedding and started telling dirty jokes.  \"The Babymakers\" is utterly clueless about its tone and has no idea how relentlessly it is undercutting itself. By the time we arrive at the obligatory happy ending, which is perfunctory and automatic, I felt sort of insulted. If Chandrasekhar thinks his audience will laugh at his vulgarity, why does he believe it requires a feel-good ending? Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Friday the 13th", "Review": "\"Friday the 13th\" is about the best \"Friday the 13th\" movie you could hope for. Its technical credits are excellent. It has a lot of scary and gruesome killings. Not a whole lot of acting is required. If that's what you want to find out, you can stop reading. OK, now it's just us in the room. You're not planning to see \"Friday the 13th,\" and you wonder why anyone else is. Since the original movie came out in 1980, there were 10 more films -- sequels, retreads, fresh starts, variations, whatever. Now we get the 2009 \"Friday the 13th,\" which is billed as a \"remake\" of the original. Advertisement That it is clearly not. Let me test you with a trick question: How many kids did Jason kill in the first movie? The answer is none, since Mrs. Voorhees, his mother, did all of the killings, in revenge on the camp counselors who let her beloved son drown in Crystal Lake. Mrs. Voorhees is decapitated at the end of No. 1, and again in the new version, so the new movie is technically a remake up until that point -- but the decapitation, although preceded by several murders, comes before this movie's title card, so everything after that point is new. It will come as little surprise that Jason still lives in the woods around Crystal Lake and is still sore about the decapitation of his mom. Jason must be sore in general. So far in the series, he has been drowned, sliced by a machete in the shoulder, hit with an ax in the head, supposedly cremated, aped by a copycat killer, buried, resurrected with a lightning bolt, chained to a boulder and thrown in the lake again, resurrected by telekinesis, drowned again, resurrected by an underwater electrical surge, melted by toxic waste, killed by the FBI, resurrected through the possession of another body, returned to his own body, thrown into hell, used for research, frozen cryogenically, thawed, blown into space, freed to continue his murder spree on Earth 2, returned to the present, faced off against Freddy Krueger of \"Nightmare on Elm Street,\" drowned again with him, and made to emerge from Crystal Lake with Freddy's head, which winks. I know what you're thinking. No, I haven't seen them all. Wikipedia saw them so I didn't have to. The question arises: Why does Jason continue his miserable existence, when his memoirs would command a seven-figure advance, easy? There is another question. In the 1980 movie, 20 years had already passed since Jason first went to sleep with the fishes. Assuming he was a camper aged 12, he would have been 32 in 1980, and in 2009, he is 61. That helps explain why one of my fellow critics at the screening was wearing an AARP T-shirt. Advertisement Spoiler warning! At the end of this film, Jason is whacked with an ax and a board, throttled with a chain and dragged into a wood chipper, although we fade to black just before the chips start to fly, and we are reminded of Marge Gunderson's immortal words. The next day brings a dawn, as one so often does, and two survivors sit on the old pier with Jason's body wrapped and tied in canvas. Then they throw him into Crystal Lake. Anyone who thinks they can drown Jason Voorhees for the fifth time is a cockeyed optimist. Note: In my research I discovered that the scientific name for fear of Friday the 13th is paraskavedekatriaphobia. I envision a new franchise: \"Paraskavedekatriaphobia: A New Beginning,\" \"Paraskavedekatriaphobia: Jason Lives,\" \"Paraskavedekatriaphobia: Freddy's Nightmare,\" etc."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "A Boy Called Po", "Review": "The intentions behind \"A Boy Called Po\" are not only good, but honorable. In this story of a young widower dad raising an autistic son, screenwriter Colin Goldman's clear intention is to chip away at some of the stigmas associated with people\u2014particularly children\u2014on the autism spectrum. \"A Boy Called Po,\" directed by John Asher, has some problems, although it always feels a little unfair to criticize a movie like this. The script tries to do way too much, but the film also moved me quite deeply a couple of times, mostly in the scenes between father and son. In multiple scenes, doctors and therapists explain various treatments, and what aspect of autism they were designed to address. The language is quite technical, but for those not familiar with this world, these sequences may be enlightening. And then there is the presence of the mighty Burt Bacharach, who contributed the score for the film, his first original score\u00a0in 17 years. Advertisement In the opening sequence, David Wilson (Christopher Gorham) is shown standing over his wife's casket, and then crying alone in bed. His son Patrick (Julian Feder), \"Po\" for short, is shown wandering around a playground, casting a long shadow, lost in his own world except for the moments when he's bullied by a bigger kid. This sequence goes on for quite some time, all as Bethany Joy Lenz sings Burt Bacharach's monster hit \"(They Long To Be) Close To You,\" made famous initially by The Carpenters. If you didn't know Burt Bacharach's involvement in \"A Boy Called Po,\" the foregrounding of the song in these opening scenes might be confusing. It's a music video, essentially. But we'll get back to Bacharach. Po is a very smart kid: the blackboard over his bed is covered in complex math and he reads the stock pages of the\u00a0Wall Street Journal. But he is a handful. In the wake of his mother's death, Po has retreated and regressed. His school can no longer deal with him. The principal suggests to David that maybe mainstreaming Po with the other kids is no longer a viable option. David is overwhelmed juggling work and fatherhood. An engineer, he is racing to meet a deadline with his design for a hybrid aircraft. The pressure is on for him to deliver. His boss is losing patience. But how can he focus on work when Po's school calls every other day with some new issue? Po drifts more and more into a dream-world, manifested in the film as a sunset-lit beach, or a green forest, where Po meets up with a pirate, or a cowboy, or a knight (all played by Andrew Bowen). In the dream-world, the pirate/cowboy/knight looks to Po for advice or help with things. Po is treated with respect. In the real world, David finds it harder and harder to connect with his son. Po \"drifts\" farther and farther away. The scenes between father and son are considered, complex, and authentic. Advertisement Autism receives mostly reductive and condescending treatment in film, with prodigy children displaying adorable eccentricities, dazzling mathematical or musical genius, spouting wise epigrams in disconnected deadpan. \"Po\" avoids these traps. It is very good on the bureaucratic nightmare that is a parent's reality in this situation: overburdened school systems, multiple therapists, health insurance, impatient employers. The main subplot, however, involving David's airplane project, takes up too much space, with additional symbolic meaning heaped onto it. For example, it's not enough that David struggles to keep his job, dealing with his boss' displeasure about all the days where he has to leave early. That's a valid enough challenge, and should be good enough to get the point across, but in \"A Boy Called Po,\" David is working on a plane that will revolutionize how we fly, and help stop global warming too. \"Will he or won't he finish his important plane?\" feels like a question being asked by another movie. We're supposed to feel the loss (to humanity) if David gets fired. It's too much. The film trips over its own feet with this overreaching subplot. Burt Bacharach, three-time Oscar winner, six-time Grammy winner (plus a Lifetime Achievement Grammy), needs no introduction. His scores include \"What's New Pussycat,\" \"Lost Horizon,\" \"Arthur,\" and\u2014most famously\u2014\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" He has composed some of the most famous songs of the 20th century, sung by some of our most distinctive singers: \"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,\" \"I Say a Little Prayer,\" \"The Look of Love,\" \"I'll Never Fall In Love Again,\" \"Arthur's Theme,\" \"That's What Friends Are For.\" In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked him #32 in their 100 Greatest Songwriters of all time. Burt Bacharach is 89 years old. In 2007, his daughter Nikki\u2014who had gone undiagnosed with Asperger's\u2014committed suicide at the age of 40. Asher reached out to Bacharach for licensing rights to \"Close to You,\" but Bacharach, after seeing the film, decided he wanted to write a score for it, as well as a theme song, in tribute to his daughter. Bacharach's music in \"Po\" is a gentle and melancholy piano, holding the sometimes awkward pieces together, underscoring the emotions, never pushing them. It's a beautiful contribution, and worthy of being singled out, considering Bacharach's status. The recent \"Life, Animated,\" a documentary showing Owen Suskind's journey from incommunicable child to confident public speaker, via his love of Disney characters, went a long way towards shattering stigmas around people with autism, and it did so with humor, and with an honest portrayal of the challenges families face. It did not soft-pedal the negatives. \"A Boy Called Po\" is clearly a personal project for everyone involved (many of them have autistic children themselves), and it mostly does what it set out to do.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story", "Review": "When Lee Atwater was a boy, a fryer full of hot grease fell on his little brother Joe, killing him. \"He said he heard those screams every single day for the rest of his life,\" a friend remembers. \"He grew up in a world without mercy.\" A plausible case can be made that Lee Atwater was the greatest single influence on American politics in the last 40 years. He was instrumental in the elections of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Karl Rove and Bush 43 were his proteges. It is universally acknowledged that Atwater wrote the modern Republican playbook. \"If he had lived,\" a friend believes, \"Bill Clinton would never have been elected president.\"  Advertisement Atwater predicted before anyone else that Clinton would be the greatest threat to Bush 41. He took the Clintons' Whitewater investment, in which they lost their entire $28,000, and made it the target of a $70 million federal investigation, which produced little of interest except a campaign talking point. The funny thing was, Atwater didn't much care if he was a Republican or a Democrat. It was only about winning. Looking for opportunities in college, he picked the Young Republicans because there were fewer of them and better opportunities for him. Ever since he managed a campaign for class president in high school, he found himself more at home behind the scenes. In the Young Republicans, he managed Karl Rove's campaign to lead the organization. Members of the YRs at the time believe Rove probably lost, but say Atwater stole the election and then placed the decision into the hands of Vice President George H.W. Bush, who decided in favor of Rove. Soon he was inside the Republican national party. Having helped Reagan survive Iran-contra, he more or less appointed himself Bush 41's campaign adviser. He created the infamous Willie Horton ads when Bush ran against Michael Dukakis, and floated rumors that Dukakis was against the Pledge of Allegiance. Asked at the time about the labeling of Dukakis as unpatriotic, young Bush 43 said to call him that would be a \"mis-adjective.\" Even while running Bush 41's campaign, he was never admitted to the Bush inner circle, Barbara Bush distrusted him, and he came close to being fired. Then Bush started winning primaries. Remembering that presidential year, the Republican strategist Mary Matalin says, \"Bush was a wimp and a wuss. Atwater was a hick and a hack.\" Atwater perfected at that time the technique of the \"push-pull\" poll, where the question itself served to spread suspicion (\"do you believe Governor Dukakas opposes saluting the flag?\"). He and George W. Bush became fast friends soon after they met, Rove adopted his tactics, and Atwater's posthumous influence could be seen in the Swift-Boating of John Kerry. \"Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story,\" a remarkable documentary directed by Stefan Forbes, uses interviews with Atwater's targets and, especially, his old comrades, to paint a remarkable portrait of Atwater, who was charming, funny, smart and a good enough blues musician to play on David Letterman and cut an album with B.B. King. He was also tortured and driven, and a bi-partisan backstabber. Ed Rollins, Atwater's White House boss at the time, says in the doc that Atwater leaked a false story to ABC that \"top GOP sources\" said Rollins was leading an undercover effort to smear Geraldine Ferraro. Atwater wanted to force Rollins out in a new Bush administration, he says. Rollins hated him. But when Atwater was dying, he begged Rollins to look after him. \"They're trying to destroy me,\" he said. Advertisement Atwater was popular with many reporters because he was good for quotes and leaks (or \"leaks\") and denials that were outrageous but delivered with disarming charm. About Iran-contra: \"We don't discuss how we make sausage.\" About the Willie Horton ad: \"I don't think a lot of Southerners even noticed there was a black man in that ad.\" Atwater had a genius for creating language that voters would remember. Learning that Tom Turnipseed, a Democratic opponent to his South Carolina congressional candidate, had received shock therapy as a young man, Atwater gleefully translated: \"They had to hook him up to jumper cables.\"  \"Boogie Man\" is a fascinating portrait of an almost likable rogue. You'd rather spend time with him than a lot of more upstanding citizens. It makes a companion piece to Oliver Stone's \"W.\" Atwater's death by brain tumor at age 40 was preceded by deathbed regrets. The film has heartbreaking footage of this boyishly handsome man turned by chemo and radiation into a feeble, bloated caricature of himself. On his deathbed, he called for a Bible, and sent telegrams of apology to those he had offended, even Willie Horton. \"He said what he had done was bad and wrong,\" Rollins remembers. \"He was scared to death of the afterlife.\" Mary Matalin, who never trusted or approved of Atwater, says: \"After he died, they found the Bible still wrapped in its cellophane.\" She thinks he might have been spinning right to the end. Unusually for a South Carolina boy, Atwater had absolutely no interest in sports. None, except for professional wrestling. He loved it because it was fake, and everyone knew it was fake, and that was the whole point."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Canvas", "Review": "\"Canvas\" is a serious film about mental illness and a sentimental heartwarmer, and succeeds in both ways. It tells the story of a 10-year-old whose mother is schizophrenic, and whose father is loyal and loving but stretched almost beyond his endurance. The portrayal of schizophrenia in the film has been praised by mental health experts as unusually accurate and sympathetic; the story of the boy and his dad is a portrait of love under enormous stress. Writer-director Joseph Greco says the film, his first feature, was influenced by his own childhood with a schizophrenic mother. Even the father's determination to build a sailboat comes from Greco's own life. His film benefits from persuasive, moving performances from all three leads: Joe Pantoliano as John Marino, a construction worker; Marcia Gay Harden as Mary, his wife, and Devon Gearhart as their young son, Chris. There is also an affecting performance by Sophia Bairley as Dawn, a schoolmate who becomes Chris's friend and confidant. Advertisement As the film opens, Mary is just a little too demonstrative in her love for Chris, who she possibly hasn't seen for awhile. That night Chris is awakened by flashing blue lights through the window; his mother has had a panic attack and his father and the police are bringing her back to the house. She is under medication, which doesn't seem to be working, and on another night, when she runs wild through a rainstorm, the police handcuff her \"for her own safety,\" and she is committed to an asylum. All of this is very hard on Chris, as cruel schoolmates taunt him about his crazy mother. When his father, desperate for distraction, begins to build a sailboat in the driveway, Chris begins to hear that his dad is crazy, too. He is a wise, solemn kid, but it all begins to get to him, especially when his mother inappropriately crashes his precious birthday party for a few friends in a local arcade. The more movies I see, the more I wonder at what actors can do. Consider Joe Pantoliano. Famous for \"The Sopranos,\" established as a character actor playing gangster and comic types, known by everyone, including himself, as \"Joey Pants,\" he has a role here that most people would never think of him for, and he brings it tenderness and depth. He still loves his wife, and yearns for her return to health. He loves his son, but isn't always perceptive enough of his needs. He spends money on the boat that he doesn't have. He has worked hard for 20 years and has a boss who isn't fair with him. Pantoliano brings to all of these dimensions a confidence and understanding that is a revelation; how many other actors are trapped by typecasting and have such unexplored regions within their talent? Marcia Gay Harden finds a fine balance between madness and the temptations of overacting. Yes, she runs wild sometimes, but always as a human being, not as a caricature. And as the son, Devon Gearhart, who is at the center of many of the crucial scenes, has an unaffected and natural sincerity that is effective and convincing. I have noticed recently several performances by children that have a simplicity and grace that adults can only envy. The film's ending may be more upbeat than the characters could hope for in real life, but it doesn't cave in to neat solutions. One scene in particular looks like a manufactured happy ending until the camera pulls back and provides a context for it. \"Canvas\" is a heartwarmer, as I said, a touching story of these people for whom the only response to mental illness is love.

Opening this week in theaters and on VOD, the directed by Alex Renarivelo (heretofore known, if at all, for direct-to-video racing sagas) from a script by Renarivelo and his producer Ali Afshar, opens with a montage of video images of dogs being generally adorable, which montage then shifts to a depiction of dogs helping folks with autism and being generally of service. While all this is happening, one notices that the cast includes James Remar, the gruff character actor who gave Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy so much trouble in \u201c48 Hours.\u201d Maybe he plays the bad guy, one thinks. Advertisement After the dogs-are-great montage, there\u2019s hidden-cam footage of an illegal \u201cpuppy mill,\u201d in which dogs are kept in deplorable condition. The footage, we learn, is being captured by Sara (Allison Paige) and Trevor (Michael King), two eager-beaver young animal rights activists who work for a fictionalized PETA-like organization. At their offices, Sara is subjected to the ice-cold, blue-eyed flattery of agency head Cassie, played by a Sharon-Stone-like Christina Moore. Here\u2019s where little alarm bells went off for me. I know that non-profits are insane and unhappy in their own ways, but I\u2019ve hardly ever gone into the offices of one and had it feel like a negative inside-baseball simulation of, say, CAA. Sara gets a new assignment: to pose as an intern and go undercover at a kennel run by Daniel Holloway, a family business that conveniently also employs Daniel Holloway\u2019s in-his-early-twenties son Will (Jayson Blair), who is as hunky as Sara is comely. (Said comeliness is emphasized in Sara\u2019s casual wear as she walks into Will\u2019s life; Will tells her to cover up a bit, as dad is conservative.) Dad, that is, Daniel, is played by the aforementioned Remar, and at first, boy is he gruff. But we, and Sara, soon learn that Daniel is a responsible kennel man, who lavishes superb care on his dogs, and whatever problems with canines are afoot in the area are due to poachers near the Halloway land. None of this matters a whit to Sherrie Stringfield\u2019s Jackie, a local animal control authority who\u2019s determined, along with Sara\u2019s bosses, to bring Halloway down. And here\u2019s where the film gets kind of weird: when you realize that the casting of Remar has been completely against type, the better for the filmmakers to pull a switcheroo. The nature of said switcheroo is evident early on, but it becomes completely explicit when a fake TV commercial that\u2019s a meticulous pastiche of that Sarah MacLachlan ASPCA ad that you switch off every time it comes on the set because it\u2019s just so much of a long-winded bummer is shown on screen, the better to highlight the insincerity of the Christina Moore character. The movie goes on to argue that such agencies aren\u2019t REALLY interested in animal welfare. The movie is shamelessly manipulative on several levels, and the cast members do their respective bits effectively. Paige and the very unfortunately named Jayson Blair (no relation to the disgraced journalist, but maybe a middle initial is called for here) are appealing, Remar clearly relished the opportunity to play a tough guy who\u2019s really super-tender, Lea Thompson as the Halloway matriarch is very Lea Thompson-esque, and so on. The movie has good production value, moves along nicely, but has rather goofy dialogue (\u201cI thought this whole puppy-saving thing was just something you were doing on the side,\u201d Sara\u2019s dad says to her before she embarks on her mission.) But imagine my surprise when I started to watch what I thought maybe would be some kind of heart-tugging animal-centric melodrama and instead got a pretty bald piece of anti-SPCA and/or PETA propaganda. That\u2019s not a diss, incidentally; propaganda isn\u2019t always bad, but that\u2019s what this is: the movie literally ends with a title card saying \u201cLearn The Truth: Investigate Before You Donate.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Little Death", "Review": "The Australian sex comedy \u201cThe Little Death\u201d coyly takes its title from the French idiom for orgasm. It toys with the idea of being racy and dabbles in dark humor. Similarly, it flits around several couples struggling with intimacy issues and it meanders between various types of tone. Basically, it won\u2019t commit. There is simultaneously too much and not enough going on in writer/director/co-star Josh Lawson\u2019s feature debut. He crams in too many people and plot lines but offers too little in the way of character development and credible emotion. And he weaves a supposedly hilarious sexual assault thread throughout the proceedings, which may leave you feeling icky. Advertisement As we\u2019re introduced to each of the Sydney couples and their sexual fetishes, we begin with Lawson himself and Bojana Novakovic as Paul and Maeve. While awkwardly messing around in the bedroom one night, Maeve informs Paul that she would like him to rape her, a misunderstanding that\u2019s played for uncomfortable laughs. It\u2019s her fantasy, she explains\u2014but she doesn\u2019t want to know for sure that it\u2019s Paul if and when it actually happens. The misguided notion of rape as a source of sexual pleasure, rather than an act of aggression, consistently taints this story line. Dan (Damon Herriman) and Evie (Kate Mulvany) also are trying new ways to reignite that spark. They\u2019re just not communicating their needs to each other these days. Their couples therapist suggests a little role playing, which Evie initially has trouble doing with a straight face. But Dan takes this assignment seriously to the extent that he starts thinking he\u2019s a real actor, with increasingly elaborate costumes, props and backstories for his naughty characters. His self-seriousness provides a few laughs here. Meanwhile, Richard (Patrick Brammall) and Rowena (Kate Box) are in an even more tenuous position. They\u2019ve been trying methodically to have a baby for the past three years, rendering sex a matter of scheduling rather than spontaneity. (\u201cHow\u2019s your cervical mucus?\u201d he asks politely one morning.) But when Richard\u2019s father dies suddenly\u2014and Rowena discovers the sight of him sobbing surprisingly turns her on\u2014she starts finding ways to make him break down and cry to prompt passionate romps. It\u2019s an amusingly twisted concept, but it also results in the darkest of the film\u2019s endings. Advertisement The marriage of middle-aged Phil (Alan Dukes) and Maureen (Lisa McCune) is in the worst condition of all. He\u2019s a milquetoast corporate drone; she\u2019s a belittling shrew. She consistently rejects his efforts to get frisky. But when Phil realizes that he\u2019s attracted to Maureen when she\u2019s asleep\u2014and quiet, and pliable\u2014he begins drugging her tea at night, then having his way with her. This mostly consists of dressing her up and cuddling, but the idea that she\u2019s being physically manipulated when she\u2019s practically unconscious is also a little queasy-making.\u00a0 Lawson bops around between all these couples as their individual fetishes escalate, resulting in a few amusing moments and a lot of jarring tonal shifts. \u201cThe Little Death\u201d veers from wacky physical comedy to forced poignancy to tragedy to romance, none of which is ever terribly convincing.\u00a0Much of the problem lies in the fact that we don\u2019t really know anything about these people outside of these small boxes in which we view them. They\u2019re defined almost exclusively by their relationship problems. When Rowena shows up at Maeve\u2019s house late into the film, and Maeve mentions that they\u2019re longtime friends, it\u2019s like: \u201cHuh? Where did that come from?\u201d But Lawson also ostensibly aims to tie these stories together with the appearance of a 60ish new neighbor named Steve (Kim Gyngell). He knocks on each of their doors with a friendly smile, homemade cookies and the admission that he\u2019s a registered sex offender, but they\u2019re all too distracted or busy for this piece of information to register. It\u2019s an element that never quite works and has an odd payoff. The last couple we meet, though, is the most intriguing of all. Monica (Erin James) is an operator for an online video chat service that makes phone calls for the hearing impaired. Sam (T.J. Power) is a deaf man who rings her up in the middle of the night with an unusual request: He\u2019d like her to help him connect with a phone sex operator. The result is hilarious and awkward and sweet, and it allows Monica and Sam to bond quickly and powerfully. This may sound like a contrived meet-cute, but it ends up being the most accessible and charming story of all. Here, Lawson comes up with a clever concept and executes it effectively. Despite the raunchy, graphic places this segment goes, it wraps up in unexpectedly romantic fashion, and it finally finds the tricky mix of tones that had eluded Lawson all along. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Of Gods and Men", "Review": "Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction. So wrote the French philosopher Pascal in the 17th century, and his words are quoted by one of the monks in this solemn and engrossing film. \u201cOf Gods and Men\u201d is based on an event in Algeria in 1996, when eight Trappist monks were taken hostage by terrorists. The film centers on the fact that the monks could easily have evaded this fate but chose not to. Every scene in the film involves these monks, and most of the scenes are set in their monastery. Several times a day, they put on white robes and pray and sing in a little chapel. The rest of the time, they tend crops, keep bees, sell honey, treat the sick of the district, eat bread and soup while being read to, and hold community meetings around a table with a candle on it.  Advertisement They make no attempt to convert anyone to Catholicism. They live peacefully in a Muslim community, attend a service for a child, employ some of the nearby people as workers. There is a deep serenity in their way of life. Although we come to know the monks by face and name, the film makes no particular attempt to focus on their personalities, except for two: Brother Christian (Lambert Wilson), who they have elected as leader, and Brother Luc, played by gentle old Michael Lonsdale, who I first saw in 1962 in Orson Welles\u2019 \"The Trial\" \u2014 that time, too, playing a cleric. Luc is the doctor, himself old, sick and asthmatic, but seeing countless patients every day and sometimes imparting benevolent advice, as when a village girl questions him about love. Christian is clear-eyed and resolute in his idea of their mission in this place distant from their birthplace in France; they have been called by God to minister to the sick and hungry. There is revolution in the land. A group of Croatian migrant workers have their throats cut by terrorists. The Algerian government urges the monks to leave, the army offers protection, but Brother Christian refuses; there is no place for the army in a monastery. They will deal with what comes. The most fraught scene comes when terrorists break in on Christmas Eve, demanding that old Luc come with them to care for a wounded comrade. Christian turns them away, after quoting from the Koran. Their leader, Rabbia (Sabrina Ouazani), is, somewhat unexpectedly, convinced. The next group of terrorists will not be so forgiving. \"Of Gods and Men\" asks us to admire these monks, whose lives are wholly devoted to good works. There is an uplifting scene when they welcome an old friend with a dinner at which wine is served, the music of \"Swan Lake\" plays and joy shines from their faces. After some discussion, they follow Christian in deciding to stay at the monastery, no matter what.  Advertisement The movie has a narration making a sharp distinction between radical Islamic terrorists and the peaceful Muslims who share the district with the monks. But stay. There is another side to the Algerian question, the side of the forcible French occupation and its decades of repressive rule. This land is not France. Technically, which side could be called terrorist?  The film doesn\u2019t raise such political questions, except in one enigmatic sentence by a local official. It focuses entirely on the nobility of the monks in choosing to stay with their vocation and their duty in the face of quite probable death. Did they make the right choice? In their own idealistic terms, yes. In realistic terms, I say no. They have the ability to help many who need it for years to come. It is egotism to believe their help must take place in this specific monastery. Between the eight of them, they have perhaps a century of life of usefulness remaining. Do they have a right to deprive those who need it of their service? In doing so, are they committing the sin of pride? I found myself resisting the film\u2019s pull of easy emotion. There are fundamental questions here, and the film doesn\u2019t engage them. I believe Christian should have had the humility to lead his monks away from the path of self-sacrifice."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Fish Tank", "Review": "Andrea Arnold's piercing \"Fish Tank\" is the portrait of an angry, isolated 15-year-old girl who is hurtling toward a lifetime of misery. She is so hurt and lonely, we pity her. Her mother barely even sees her. The film takes place in a bleak British public housing estate, and in the streets and fields around it. There is no suggestion of a place this girl can go to find help, care or encouragement. The girl is Mia, played by Katie Jarvis in a harrowing display of hostility. She's been thrown out of school, is taunted as a weirdo by boys her age, has no friends, converses with her mother and sister in screams and retreats to an empty room to play her music and dance alone. She drinks what little booze she can get her hands on. Advertisement And where is her mother? Right there at home, all the time. Joanne (Kierston Wareing) looks so young, she might have had Mia at Mia's age. Joanne is shorter, busty, dyed blond, a chain-smoker, a party girl. The party is usually in her living room. One day, she brings home Connor (Michael Fassbender), a good-looking guy who seems nice enough. Mia screams at him, too, but it's a way of getting attention.  Joanne seems happiest when Mia isn't at home. The girl wanders the streets and gets in a fight when she tries to free a horse chained in a barren lot near some shabby mobile homes. She surfs in an Internet cafe, goes to an audition for sexy dancers and breaks into a house at random. One day differs from the routine. Connor takes Mia, her mom and her little sister Tyler (Rebecca Griffiths) on a drive to the country. This isn't an idyllic picnic; they simply park in a field and hike to a river, Joanne staying with the car. Connor takes Mia wading (\"I can't swim\") in the river. Walking barefoot, she gets a ride on his back and rests her chin on his shoulder, and what was in the air from the first is now manifest. Some reviews call Connor a pedophile. I think he's more of an immoral opportunist. \"Fish Tank,\" in any event, isn't so much about sex as about the helpless spiral Mia is going through. The film has two fraught but ambiguous scenes -- one when she goes to Connor's home, another involving a young girl -- that we can make fairly obvious assumptions about. But the movie doesn't spell them out; Arnold sees everything through Mia's eyes and never steps outside to explain things from any other point of view. She knows who the young girl is, and we are left to assume. Whatever she thinks after the visit to Connor's house, we are not specifically told. The film so firmly identifies with Mia that there might even be a possibility Joanne is better than the slutty monster we see. A slim possibility, to be sure. In a film so tightly focused, all depends on Katie Jarvis' performance. There is truth in it. She lives on an Essex housing estate like the one in the movie, and she was discovered by Arnold while in a shouting match with her boyfriend at the Tilbury train station, which is seen in the movie. Now 18, she gave birth to a daughter conceived when she was 16. We can fear, but we can't say, that she was heading for a life similar to the one Mia seems doomed to experience. Her casting in this film, however, led to Cannes, the Jury Prize, and contracts with British and American agents. She is a powerful acting presence, flawlessly convincing here. And Arnold, who won an Oscar for her shattering short film \"Wasp\" (2003), also about a neglectful alcoholic mother, deserves comparison with a British master director like Ken Loach.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Diary of the Dead", "Review": "When young filmmakers gather to shoot cinema-verite video documentaries, watch out: Something really bad is going to happen. In \u201cThe Blair Witch Project,\u201d it was ... well, we don\u2019t really know what it was, but it sure freaked out Heather. In \u201cCloverfield,\u201d it was something large with an antipathy toward Manhattan landmarks. And in George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cDiary of the Dead,\u201d as you have probably gathered by now, it is the meat-eating undead. These movies give the shaky-cam a reason to get shaky \u2014 but the kids try not to miss a shot. Advertisement \u201cDiary\u201d is ostensibly edited by Debra (Michelle Morgan) from hand-held footage shot on the run by her film-student boyfriend Jason (Joshua Close) and some of their friends, who\u2019ve been collaborating on Jason\u2019s horror-movie student project, overseen by their alcoholic film professor Maxwell (Scott Wentworth), who\u2019s just about the only person over 30 in the entire film, except for an old Amish guy who swings a mean scythe.  Writer-director Romero may be 68, but \u201cDiary\u201d is targeted at the Young of Intestines, a generation for whom zombie movies and Web video are facts of everyday life, as natural as eating flesh. This is the fifth of Romero\u2019s \u201cLiving Dead\u201d series, which started 40 years ago with the revolutionary \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d (the grainy, black-and-white, trapped-in-the-house one \u2014 and still the scariest), \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d (the shopping mall one, 1978), \u201cDay of the Dead\u201d (the military bunker one, 1985), \u201cLand of the Dead\u201d (the walled-city one, 2005), and now \u201cDiary of the Dead,\u201d which might be called the Web one. (Romero has another sequel scheduled for 2009.) The last \u201cDead\u201d movie had stars like Dennis Hopper, Asia Argento, John Leguizamo and Simon Baker. Now Romero returns to his DIY roots, though there\u2019s a lot of star-power off-camera, with newsreader voice cameos by the likes of Wes Craven, Stephen King, Simon Pegg (\u201cShaun of the Dead\u201d), Quentin Tarantino and Guillermo del Toro. In \u201cNight of the Living Dead,\u201d Romero used radio and television news broadcasts to envelop an isolated Pennsylvania farmhouse in an atmosphere of invisible but impending menace, the unseen specter of a larger world gone undead. Now those technologies have been all but supplanted by \u201cpro-sumer\u201d videocams, security surveillance monitors and laptops with broadband Web connections. Nobody believes the government spin spread by conventional mass media anymore. Bloodthirsty corpses have run amok in the streets, and the Homeland Security Alert system has been temporarily raised to orange. It\u2019s up to citizen-journalist bloggers and amateur videographers to capture and disseminate the raw, unfiltered story of what\u2019s really going on, to show you the horrific truth they won\u2019t put on TV. Advertisement Does this scenario remind you of anything? \u201cDiary\u201d presents a world of post-9/11, post-Iraq-invasion paranoia and distrust of the \u201cofficial story.\u201d (We used to call this a \u201cpost-Watergate\u201d skepticism, but we\u2019re post- that now.) The zombies you can see. You can run them over in your Winnebago or take them down with a shot to the head. But the larger monster is uncertainty: What is happening? Why? And where will it strike next? \u201cI think that\u2019s what started the panic \u2014 not knowing the truth,\u201d one character says. This is what really puts the \u201cterror\u201d in \u201cterrorism,\u201d not the flesh-ripping shenanigans of the suicide-zombies right there in front of you \u2014 although they do tend to surprise you by lunging from just beyond the edge of the frame.  When Debra takes a moment to reflect on a future of endless war, in which every person who is killed returns from the dead to kill someone else ... she\u2019s talking about the cycles of vengeance and violence in places like Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 blowback, not just biteback. At the beginning of the movie, Debra tells us that she\u2019s assembled the feature we\u2019re about to see \u2014 \u201cThe Death of Death,\u201d a doc in the vein of Internet 9/11 conspiracy exposes like \u201cLoose Change\u201d \u2014 and has added music in some scenes because she wants to scare us into waking up to the truth: \u201cI am trying to scare you.\u201d Well, with just two videocams and a dwindling number of operators, they never quite get the truth, just some juicy fragments here and there. And \u201cDiary of the Dead\u201d isn\u2019t really all that scary. Even a mansion swarming with the undead is no match for the theatrical competition of, say, Daniel Plainview or Anton Chigurh. But while horror provides the marketing hook, Romero\u2019s movies are even more entertaining for their zesty sociopolitical satire, and like its ancestors, \u201cDiary\u201d explodes like an undead noggin with that stuff. A favorite touch: someone on a talk radio show is overheard remarking that the real \u201cimmigration problem\u201d is now about people crossing the border between life and death. \u201cThere\u2019s always a market for horror \u2014 believable horror,\u201d director Jason expounds during a nighttime location shoot for his mummy movie. You may not believe in zombies, but the unnamed dread in the air of \u201cDiary of the Dead\u201d is recognizably believable, because we live with it now. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "A War", "Review": "This Danish movie opens with a scene of high tension that\r\nsoon situates the viewer exactly where he or she would never want to be. In\r\nAfghanistan, a group of Danish peacekeepers is scouring a patch of barren land,\r\nwalking in a narrow, evenly-spaced line. The better not to get blown up by a\r\nland mine. Their work is methodical. The soldiers are in constant contact with\r\ntheir base, and its commanders and intel officers are providing calm, expert\r\nguidance. But of course something bad is going to happen. And something bad\r\ndoes happen, and the consequences weigh heavily on the commanding officer,\r\nClaus Pedersen. Out of a sense of guilt, and more overtly to make up for the\r\nabsence of a shell-shocked soldier whom he\u2019s decided to put on camp patrol,\r\nPedersen begins accompanying his troops on their away-from-base rounds. He\r\ndoesn\u2019t know it, but he\u2019s setting himself up for a fall.  Advertisement I\u2019m being\r\ndeliberately vague about the plot points of this gut-churning movie, written\r\nand directed by Tobias Lindholm, it\u2019s because I truly believe, beyond any kind\r\nof \u201cspoiler-alert\u201d preemptive service-journalism second-guessing, that this is\r\na movie best experienced more or less cold. Pedersen, beautifully portrayed by\r\nPilou Asb\u00e6k, is a good man\u2014a large portion of the movie\u2019s first half crosscuts\r\nbetween him and his wife and kids in Denmark, and his devotion and care is\r\nalmost palpable\u2014and arguably a good soldier. But what does it actually mean to\r\nbe a \u201cgood soldier?\u201d \u201cA War\u201d asks this question in an understated but\r\nunambiguous way. The movie could take this ever-pertinent quote from Ernest\r\nHemingway as its motto: \u201cNever think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how\r\njustified, is not a crime.\u201d Once Pedersen and his troops are lured, in a\r\ncompletely appalling way, into a brutal ambush, Pedersen takes action that ends\r\nup curtailing his tour of duty, calling him back to Denmark to answer for a war\r\ncrime, weighing his own conscience against the dry dictates of a defense\r\nattorney who flatly tells him, \u201cI\u2019m here to create acquittals, not deal with\r\nmoral or ethical questions.\u201d This is a\r\nmovie where it\u2019s extremely helpful to\r\npay attention, especially during the ambush scene, because Lindholm places the\r\nviewer in a noisy, confusing predicament along with the soldiers. It\u2019s\r\ndifficult to keep track of what\u2019s going on, let alone make an assessment of\r\nwhat you yourself would do in Pedersen\u2019s place. And again, the consequences of\r\nwhat Pedersen DOES do are nothing less than appalling. Which side are you on?\r\nWhich side is the movie on? Asb\u00e6k\u00a0is such an appealing actor, and the smirks\r\nand pouts of the movie\u2019s prosecuting magistrate Lisbeth Danning, played by Charlotte Munck, are\r\nportrayed as on the petulant side, but even here the movie maintains an even\r\nhand: her arguments are cogent, sane, humanitarian, not wrong. The quiet\r\nauthority Lindholm brings to the portrayal of all the aspects of the story\u2014the\r\nsoldiering, the camaraderie, the domestic travails of Pedersen\u2019s wife as she\r\nmanages the mutating behaviors of their three young children, the bland yet\r\nimposing officiousness of the military tribunal\u2014is exemplary, and puts me in\r\nmind of the definite but unimposing style of the Iranian filmmaker Asghar\r\nFarhadi, who deals with not entirely similar but nonetheless extremely fraught\r\nmoral conundrums. \u201cA War,\u201d as tough to watch as it can be, is an extremely\r\nrewarding and disquieting experience."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Jobs", "Review": "It's customary to be told to turn off all electronic devices before a press screening these days. But at a showing of \"Jobs,\" the directive felt somewhat disingenuous given that the biopic pays homage to the Silicon Valley visionary who turned us into a society of raging gadget addicts.  And would that we had the option to leave our precious glowing doo-dads on just this once, if only to offer occasional distraction from what amounts to a glorified TV movie that is to \"The Social Network\" what \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\" is to \"Citizen Kane.\" Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to Apple guru Steve Jobs and\u2014more importantly\u2014what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's \"Behind the Music.\"  Advertisement That judgment might be a tad harsh, especially since that dear boy Ashton Kutcher\u2014considered a media savant of sorts himself for having hatched TV\u2019s \"Punk'd\" and apparently beating CNN in a Twitter-follower race\u2014really, really, REALLY tries to make us believe he is the Machiavelli of the Mac, the man who put the personal into computing. It isn't an easy job to be Jobs, after all. He might have died in 2011 at age 56 but his presence will continue to loom large as long as there are Apple stores in malls. But Kutcher never totally recovers from an introductory scene set in 2001 when, in full Zen master mode, he introduces the iPod as \"a music player\u20261,000 tunes in your pocket\" to an auditorium filled with rapt acolytes.  You only get a teasing glimpse of Kutcher in puffy middle-age makeup, most likely because he looks a little ridiculous decked out in Jobs's signature uniform: round wire-rimmed specs, gray beard and short-cropped hair, black mock turtleneck and Levis. And that is probably also a reason that the story then rewinds and instead focuses on Jobs from his college years to his early 40s. That way, the 35-year-old Kutcher can get away with his impersonation by simply varying his hair and beard length while regularly glaring with opportunistic intent.  In other scenes, the actor affectedly walks with a deliberate stooped gait, presumably emulating the real Jobs. Or maybe it's just that the responsibility of bringing such a larger-than-life icon to life is weighing down the star of \"Dude, Where's My Car?\"  But it isn't really fair to lay the primary fault for this geek tragedy's rather rote approach at the feet of its leading man. Feet, by the way, that are often unshod since, as we are shown numerous times, Jobs made a habit out of eschewing shoes\u2014all the better to make a half-hearted Christ-figure analogy. The trouble is, we don't find out much else about the guy's motivations save for this take-no-prisoners drive to be the best in the biz. All the historic moments are duly ticked off, from Jobs freeing his mind with LSD and going to India in his college-dropout years to the supposed instant he came up with the corporate name of Apple. But while Jobs might have touted the iPod as a tool with a heart, this portrait of him is too often without a pulse. Advertisement Kutcher at least comes alive during the warts-and-all parts of the story. He isn't half bad when being a bastard, such as when Jobs screams at anyone who defies his perfectionist aesthetic, doesn\u2019t perform to his exacting standards or dares to steal an idea (too bad not more is made out of his feud with Microsoft's Bill Gates). Failing to acknowledge the importance of multiple font options to this tech titan was apparently like waving a wire hanger in front of Joan Crawford.  Leading up to his eventual fall from grace at the company before his resurrection as its CEO, Jobs tends to behave like an insensitive self-serving ass, especially when he refuses to acknowledge his out-of-wedlock daughter or denies compensation to deserving friends who helped build the Apple empire back when it was a two-bit operation in his dad's garage. But save for a few references of being abandoned by his birth parents and adopted later, the source of Jobs's jerky behavior never is revealed.  Except for chubby supernerd Steve Wozniak \u2014 the most sympathetic and substantial secondary character thanks to the laidback affability of Josh Gad (Broadway's \"The Book of Mormon\") \u2014 whose idea to team a computer with a TV monitor changed both Jobs's life and the world, those aforementioned pals are mainly ciphers. Recognizable performers in business suits crop up now and then, including James Woods, Dermot Mulroney, Matthew Modine and J.K. Simmons, but their talents are barely tapped. As for the actresses who play the women in Jobs's life, they fare the worst. Poor Lesley Ann Warren is briefly seen as Jobs's adoptive mother but never heard.  Kutcher and his director, Joshua Michael Stern (\"Swing Vote\"), should have realized that when a movie presents its subject as a messiah of intuitive design who insisted that corners never be cut and compromises never struck, it should at least attempt to emulate such exacting standards. Instead, their version of Steve Agonistes too often just doesn't compute."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Only Yesterday", "Review": "2014\u2019s U.S. release of Isao Takahata\u2019s amazing animated swan song \u201cThe Tale of the Princess Kaguya\u201d was a gift and a miracle in and of itself, but it\u2019s also yielding some dividends. The first great movie of 2016, as far as U.S. releases go, is an animated picture that was made in 1991: Takahata\u2019s breathtakingly beautiful and quietly but devastatingly moving \u201cOnly Yesterday,\u201d seeing its first screenings here in both its original Japanese-language version and a scrupulously English-dubbed edition featuring the voice talents of Daisy Ridley, Dev Patel, and Ashley Eckstein.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cOnly Yesterday\u201d is one of a very distinguished handful of feature films that Takahata directed for Studio Ghibli, the outfit founded by Takahata\u2019s friend and frequent collaborator Hayao Miyazaki. Takahata\u2019s work has been marked by a determination to take on stories that U.S. viewers wouldn\u2019t necessarily associate with animation, for instance his 1988 World War II survival drama \u201cGrave of the Fireflies.\u201d He\u2019s also shown interest in expanding and changing up the aesthetic of anime, as in his 1999 \u201cMy Neighbors the Yamadas,\u201d designed in the seemingly minimalist style of Japanese comic strips. \u201cKaguya,\u201d which Takahata announced would be the last film he would direct, was a kind of grand summation of his work in terms of both form and content. \u201cOnly Yesterday\u201d is a good companion piece for a number of reasons\u2014like \u201cKaguya,\u201d it functions as a highly sensitive and empathetic consideration of the situation of women in Japanese society\u2014but it\u2019s also a breathtaking work of art on its own.\u00a0 There\u2019s no fantasy or supernatural element in the movie, but that\u2019s not to say that it entirely eschews the fantastic. The main character is a kind of young Japanese everywoman, or everywoman nonconformist. Taeko is a 27-year-old single salarywoman in 1982 Tokyo. The movie begins with her telling a work colleague that she\u2019s off to visit relatives in the countryside. Truth is, she has no actual close relatives there, but rather has signed up to help the family of her brother-in-law\u2019s older brother in her destination to harvest safflowers.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to bring my fifth-grade self along for the trip,\u201d Ridley, speaking with a U.S. accent (for those keeping track, Ridley is British and speaks with her native accent in this independent film called \u201cThe Force Awakens;\u201d her costar in that film, John Boyega, also hails from England but speaks in that film with an American accent; it\u2019s called acting, in case this all worries you), muses on the soundtrack of the English-dubbed version. And yet here she is. On the train, Taeko relates and relives events from her childhood. Some funny and charming, but most of them sad and disturbing. The mockery of more popular girls, the awkwardness of waiting for first menstruation, the cruel coldness of a father who refuses to allow her to participate in a semi-pro theatrical endeavor. The persistent squashing of her hopes and dreams helps make her eventual adult solitude make some kind of sense, but the film is not so crude as to make an overt insistence on cause-and-effect. The movie allows Taeko to keep some secrets, in a sense. As I mentioned, there are no overt fantasy elements in the story but the animated format allows visual metaphors for feelings to come to life. On the rare occasion when fifth-grade Taeko feels like she\u2019s floating on air, she floats, and a big pink heart appears in the sky. In the flashback sequences, Takahata\u2019s spectacular use of negative space\u2014the details of a softball field stretching out into a big field of white in the frame, for instance\u2014gives a palpable sense of a world only partially regained to the senses. Advertisement Once Taeko reaches her destination, she strikes up a friendship with young farmhand Toshio, with whom she talks out more of her mid-\u201860s trauma. The possibility of a romance is broached, but the film\u2019s ending, while tear-jerkingly satisfying, is \u2026 well, you ought to see it yourself. That it plays under the final credits is noteworthy.\u00a0 The English language version keeps the movie intact (I actually saw it for the first time in an unsubtitled Japanese version, via a laser disc I bought in Japan in the early \u201890s, such was my Studio Ghibli fandom at the time), Beatles references and cigarette-smoking characters and all."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Final Master", "Review": "Xu Haofeng, writer of Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s \u201cThe Grandmaster,\" returns to the martial art known as Wing Chun in \u201cThe Final Master.\" This time, instead of chronicling Ip Man, the Wing Chun master who trained Bruce Lee, Xu focuses on Chen Shi (Fan Liao), a 1930's-era master who wants to bring Wing Chun to Tianjin, a city in Northern China. Chen Shi wants to honor his master\u2019s dying wish to open a school there, so that this particular martial arts discipline may live on for future generations. Pitching a tent for Wing Chun won\u2019t be easy for Chen Shi. As more than one person will state during \u201cThe Final Master,\" this is Tianjin, and there are rules and regulations to be followed. I\u2019ll be honest with you: Said rules and regulations get so complicated that I lack the clarity to fully describe them to you. But, damn if I didn\u2019t enjoy listening to every single word in Xu\u2019s adaptation of his short story. There\u2019s a pulpy, novelistic richness to the proceedings; the characters utter lines as purple as Prince\u2019s aura while they cross and double-cross one another. Power struggles are imbued with a stubborn sense of tradition that almost justifies their occasional descent into absurdity. There\u2019s politics and military actions and a powerful nemesis named Master Zou (Wenli Jiang), whose chill demeanor is the most entertaining thing in the picture. Advertisement Master Zou makes the rules in Tianjin, and in order to open a school, one has to defeat eight of Tianjin\u2019s champions of rival schools. But that\u2019s not all. One must also be a native of Tianjin to ultimately have the school be accepted as legitimate. Being an outsider from Canton, Chen Shi must stroll into Tianjin with the manufactured appearance of a married man out to train a local resident as the apprentice who will battle the rival schools. Zhao Guohui (Jia Song), the former working girl who marries Chen Shi, has her own agenda and a tragic backstory singed with scandal. The apprentice, Geng Liang Chen (Yang Song) also has his own agenda and tragic backstory. In fact, everybody in \u201cThe Final Master\u201d has an agenda and a tragic backstory. They\u2019re always revealed in dialogue rather than flashbacks, and for the most part, they don\u2019t matter as much in the final outcome. You may find this problematic, even annoying. But I\u2019m the guy who lives for the sci-fi movie moments where scientists rattle off rivulets of extraneous, expository technobabble. So I felt right at home with all these character detail MacGuffins. Anyway, Geng Liang Chen turns out to be better at Wing Chun than Chen Shi ever imagined. \u201cHe\u2019s a prodigy,\u201d says the shifu as his pupil goes through competitor after competitor. But Chen Shi has plans to get the glory of defeating the Tianjin masters himself, with some assistance (and explanation) from older rival Zheng Shanao (Jin Shijie). Zheng wants one last battle to keep his honor and status in Tianjin, or something like that. Chen Shi plays along, but his intentions are to use his allies as chess pieces en route to his own personal checkmate. When Zhao Guohui realizes Chen Shi plans on double-crossing his rival and his apprentice, she\u2019s neither surprised nor pleased, but she sticks around to root for her husband. The women in \u201cThe Final Master\u201d are as thinly defined as the men, but they are given extra little perks of character that I found intriguing. Master Zou has a defiantly androgynous look that\u2019s never once commented on, and she exerts her power with the calmest of demeanors, even when addressing the fearsome military men who represent Tianjin\u2019s ultimate transition into a more militaristic entity. And Zhao casually mentions that she prays to Rudolph Valentino, whose picture was given to her by the foreigner whose sexual attentions unfairly made her a pariah to her family. Whether Rudy answers her prayers, I\u2019ll leave you to discover. Zhao also figures in a scene involving a departing train that feels imported from an old Hollywood studio picture, with their romantic shorthand for trains included. Advertisement As for the fights: There are plenty of well-choreographed battles in \u201cThe Final Master.\" The award-winning choreography eschews wire work, keeping the action sequences squarely on the ground. Chen Shi, Geng Liang Chen and their numerous adversaries use a variety of cutlery, from cool, circular, defensive hand devices to comically gargantuan single blades that are almost bigger than the men swinging them. Since Chen Shi\u2019s goal is, as one character puts it, \u201cto maim, not to kill,\u201d the battles aren\u2019t too gory or brutal. Instead, one focuses on the skilled craftsmanship that both fighter and filmmaker employ. There\u2019s a late reel battle in the narrowest of alleyways that\u2019s as exciting as anything in recent memory. This is a juicy, beach read of a movie, the kind of overstuffed story you\u2019d devour in book form while slumming on the sand under an umbrella."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Policeman", "Review": "\"Policeman,\" by debuting Israeli director Nadav Lapid, is a curiously bifurcated film. It starts out telling the story of one group of characters, the policemen suggested by the title. Then, about halfway through, it abruptly shifts to focus on another group, a small band of left-wing radicals. Naturally, the two stories converge toward the narrative\u2019s end, but that doesn\u2019t overcome the sense that the film suffers from a deeper bifurcation: a split between actually saying something about the tricky political and cultural issues it treats, and appearing to do so while shying away from that task\u2019s toughest challenges. Advertisement The policemen depicted in the film\u2019s first part are not ordinary cops but a five-man team in the Israeli Defense Ministry\u2019s elite Anti-Terrorism Unit. In other words, they\u2019re assigned not to police regular Israelis but to control Palestinians (a.k.a. terrorists), often by lethal means. The film doesn\u2019t start out explaining this, or showing the men in action; rather it stresses their macho camaraderie with scenes of them bicycling across the desert and engaging in horse play, playful wrestling matches and endless back-slapping at a Tel Aviv barbeque. The leader of this group, Yaron (Yiftach Klein), is described as an \"alpha male\" in the press notes, and the film displays an almost-lipsmacking avidity in conveying his masculine hotness. In one early scene, he puts an upbeat tune on the stereo and dances seductively in his short-shorts for his wife, and us, as if to make sure we haven\u2019t failed to notice his sexy build. But Yaron\u2019s also a guy facing challenges on several fronts. At home, his wife is in the final stages of pregnancy. While this carries both excited optimism and dramatic anticipation (they know the child will be a girl), it also means he\u2019s not getting laid. At a seaside restaurant, he chats up a pretty waitress and finally asks her age. She says she\u2019s 15. Ulp. Will he or won\u2019t he? At work, Yaron\u2019s unit is troubled by the knowledge that the leanest of its members has a large growth in his head. An upcoming medical test will determine if it\u2019s cancerous. Meanwhile, the entire group is under investigation for a lethal incident. The press notes describe this as \"an unforgivable accident resulting from a miscalculation during a recent rescue mission.\" But that\u2019s an obvious attempt to soft-pedal something rather different. The incident, as the film describes it, was not a mission of rescue but to assassinate a \"terrorist,\" and it resulted in the death or severe wounding of several other members of the targeted man\u2019s family, including a five-year-old boy. Advertisement The way out of their legal dilemma, Yaron and three of his fellows decide, is to ask their sick colleague to claim responsibility for the casualties, since his condition means he won\u2019t be prosecuted. But will their ailing comrade agree to the scheme? Suddenly, we\u2019re out of this world and in a very different one, observing a five-person unit on the opposite end of the political spectrum. They\u2019re a group of radical socialists who\u2019re in a frenzy over the yawning chasm between rich and poor in Israel, the greatest in the developed world, according to one. Lapid first depicts this curious bunch in the desert showing their militancy by blasting apart the only tree in sight with their handguns. Evidently, their dedication to violent action (or narcissistic self-dramatization) trumps any environmental sympathies they might have. Closer to the sarcasm of Fassbinder\u2019s \"The Third Generation\" than the romance of Godard\u2019s \"La Chinoise,\" the account of radical group-think here stresses the collision of personal and political delusions. The band\u2019s one female, a lissome strawberry blonde, is enamored of their leader, a handsome, unsmiling, strangely Nordic-looking guy who seems to have no feelings at all. Meanwhile, she is the object of unrequited infatuation from one of the group\u2019s younger, less Nordic and less commanding members. While endlessly rewriting and declaiming their manifesto against the rich, the group puts its words into action with an assault on a wedding in a posh hotel where they take several billionaires hostage. The execution of this scheme is, of course, where the radicals converge with Yaron\u2019s unit, which is shocked to find that, for once, the enemies they are wielding their guns against are \"not Arabs!\" Obviously, this tale engages many hot-button issues in present-day Israel. But does it say anything particularly incisive or meaningful about their complexity? On the contrary, its ultimate message seems to rest on a kind of glib and simplistic equivalency. \"Here in Israel we\u2019ve got fanatical fools on the right and fanatical fools on the left,\" it seems to say, \"and ne\u2019er the twain shall meet, leaving the rest of us trapped in a hopeless middle.\" Advertisement But does Lapid really believe that the issue of Israel\u2019s rich-poor divide belongs only to crazed fanatics like his leftist militants? For that matter, does this group resemble any that is active in Israel today? One of the film\u2019s problems as a drama about cultural and political problems is that all of its people seem to inhabit a thankless zone between being actual characters and arch caricatures. That archness leaves the filmmaker in a position of presumed intellectual and moral superiority, from which he can look down not only on his fictional creations but also on the real people who are struggling with the problems he evokes. This may be a comfortable perspective, but it is not an illuminating one. The film\u2019s stylistic fluency evinces a different kind of superiority. If Lapid learned his skills in school, he clearly aced Art Film 101. Somewhat like Denis Villaneuve\u2019s \"Incendies,\" a much better film, its combination of deliberate compositions, nuanced cinematography and sharply staged action suggests a director who\u2019s assimilated lessons from Kubrick, Oliver Stone and other master directors. If he evolves a moral vision to match his stylistic savvy, Lapid will be a force to be reckoned with."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Ouija", "Review": "I played\r\nwith a Ouija board exactly one time. More on that shortly. What amuses me about\r\nthe game, and that amusement transfers over to the movie version, is that it\r\nproves that there is no such thing as bad publicity. People my age will\r\nremember campfire tales and urban legends about unlucky fools who were punished\r\nfor choosing to contact the deceased using the spirit board trademarked by\r\nHasbro, and if not, I\u2019m sure you remember the 1986 movie \u201cWitchboard,\u201d if only\r\nfor Tawny Kitaen appearing in it.  Advertisement Regardless,\r\nwhenever the Ouija board gets mentioned, something horrible is associated with\r\nit. No one ever tells a story about some schlub whose Ouija board told him the\r\nMega Millions numbers, or some lucky lady who rocked the stock market based on\r\ntips from the afterworld. It\u2019s always \u201cshe was messin\u2019 with that Ouija board\r\nand a spirit KILLED her ass!\u201d In all the stories I heard growing up, players\r\nwound up as dead as most of the cast of \u201cOuija.\u201d And yet, people still bought\r\nthe product. There\u2019s probably even a Ouija app for your phone, so it can kill\r\nyou before your Apple bill does. I\u2019m being\r\nfacetious\u2014sort of. The obvious allure of the Ouija board, and why the \u201cbased on\r\nthe board game by Hasbro\u201d credit appears prominently in this movie, is that\r\nthese creepy stories are why people bought the product in the first place. In\r\nthe current economy, Monopoly makes a more appropriate board game upon which to base\r\na horror movie, but for what it is, \u201cOuija\u201d is better than expected. I like these\r\nkinds of kitchen-sink movies, films where, in an attempt to rattle you, they\r\ntoss everything at you but the kitchen sink. \u201cOuija\u201d gets a few extra points\r\nbecause it feels like the filmmakers were actually trying to tell a decent\r\ncampfire story. The movie has a nice visual polish and a story that covers all\r\nthe narrative bases of a good spooky bedtime story. Director Stiles White times\r\nits jump scares with the knowledge that jump scares are silly and predictable: A\r\ngas stove comes on with the sound of a jet engine, mirrors always have bad\r\nthings reflected in them and a flashlight rolling away always stops rolling to\r\nilluminate something unfriendly. This is a\r\nmovie where the old reliable kitty cat flying out of the dark has been replaced\r\nby the goofy boyfriend. If they\u2019d had a jump scare where the appearing-out-of-nowhere\r\ngoofy boyfriend had a kitty cat jumping out of his arms, I\u2019d have probably given\r\nmore stars.  \u201cOuija\u201d\r\nbegins with a rather creepy opening murder. After a flashback showing a\r\nchildhood Ouija game, Laine (Olivia Cooke) arrives to pick up her best friend\r\nDebby (Shelly Hennig). Debby has just violated both of the Ouija game rules her\r\nyounger version revealed in that flashback: she\u2019s played the game alone and she\u2019s\r\nburned her copy of the game. Debby begs off going out and dies a gruesome death\r\nsoon after. The coroner deems it a suicide, but we know better. \r\n Advertisement Laine\r\nbecomes obsessed with why Debby would kill herself, so she decides to \r\nuse the\r\nOuija board to try and contact her. Finally, somebody is putting this \r\nthing to\r\ngood use! In my one encounter with the Ouija board, my cousin asked it a\r\nquestion any living relative of my family could have answered. Laine, \r\nwho was always\r\nthe one kid scared enough to believe the Ouija was real, has a \r\nlegitimate query\r\none can\u2019t get answered in this realm. She convinces her friends to play \r\nalong, using the same game Debby tried burning earlier in the film.\r\n\r\n They go to\r\nDebby\u2019s house, which makes sense I guess, and before the spirit that comes\r\nthrough can spell out its entire name (it only gets to the D), everyone assumes\r\nit\u2019s Debby. This is what years of autocorrect will do to your brain. Had they\r\njust been patient, they\u2019d have seen that this was no Debby. You know\r\nwhat happens next, and \u201cOuija\u201d knows you know. Writers White and Juliet Snowden\r\npump up the tale with murdered little girls, sewn-together mouths, good reasons\r\nnever to floss, crazy, murderous mediums and an appearance by the always\r\nwelcome Lin Shaye. Shaye gives her exposition-heavy role the right amount of\r\nlunacy, menace and charm. She fills in the blanks that help Laine and her\r\nfriends understand who exactly they\u2019ve reached out and touched through the\r\nOuija board. Her last scene, filled with\r\nmaniacal laughter, probably mimics the Universal executives\u2019 response when they\r\nsee this weekend\u2019s box office grosses. Though I\r\nadmit 16-year old me enjoyed the hell out of \u201cWitchboard,\u201d I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d\r\nhave fun at \u201cOuija.\u201d But I did, and assisting me were actors who gave their\r\npaper thin teenage types a little humor and character, and the film\u2019s look. Shot\r\nby veteran camera operator, David Emmerichs, \u201cOuija\u201d is a glossy hoot, showing\r\nmore flair than a throwback to the 80\u2019s horror movie should. As a lifelong\r\nhorror movie viewer, I wasn\u2019t scared by the film, but I dug the many ways it\r\ntried to goose me. By the way,\r\nthe question my cousin asked Ouija was whether my devoutly Baptist aunt would\r\nwhup us for playing the game in her house when she explicitly told us not to do\r\nso. The board said no. I wish she had asked \u201cwhen is my mother coming home?\u201d The answer might have spared me a sore behind. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Tower", "Review": "Documentaries about events in the somewhat-distant past tend to speak in a familiar visual vocabulary. If you see enough films along those lines, you get used to the tricks, and they can make the events themselves, however gripping, feel perfunctory\u2014especially re-enactments, which tend to be either so overproduced that you wonder why they just didn't go ahead and make a dramatic film with actors, or else so abstract (silhouettes, blurred faces, closeups of hands and feet and clothing de tails) that the movie seems to have been put together from a mass-produced \"make your own documentary\" kit. Once in awhile, though, you see a documentary that creates its own distinctive aesthetic while still honoring the subject. \"Tower,\" about the 1966 mass shooting at the University of Texas at Austin, is that kind of movie.  Advertisement Directed by Keith Maitland from\u00a0Pamela Colloff's Texas Monthly article \"96 Minutes,\" it reconstructs one of the first modern sniper-driven bloodbaths, minute by minute, hour by hour, mixing traditional interviews and animation. This mix of modes finds a different way into the events of that day, capturing the fear, pain and resilience of the community in the manner of a reporter, but also a musician or painter. Like other semi-recent nonfiction films that used animation, including \"Waltz with Bashir\" and \"Chicago 10,\" \"Tower\" is explanatory journalism and history, but also personally expressive, and the two impulses never cancel each other out. The shootings took place on August 1, 1966, when a man armed with a high powered rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and other weapons locked himself in the observation deck of the main tower of the campus and started shooting at people down below, seemingly at random. At first people didn't know what was happening. The gunshots sounded like firecrackers, and the first few successful hits were scattered in so many different areas of campus that it took a while for bystanders to realize the full magnitude of the event and take cover. By the end of the day, 14 people were shot and killed; the sniper was eventually shot dead by police who breached the barricade. The UT-Austin shootings are now seen as a harbinger of shooting sprees to come, but for whatever reason this particular story has never been told in a feature-length documentary before. Maitland and his collaborators structure the story in the manner of a nonfiction novel\u2014or the type of ensemble drama that Robert Altman, Paul Thomas Anderson or Austin's own Richard Linklater might make. We're introduced to a wide variety of characters from different walks of life. Some will live, others will die; some of the survivors will watch as their friends are murdered for no reason at all.  It's a horrendous story, but the film does an exceptional job of building dread about the inevitable carnage without seeming as if it's exploiting morbid curiosity; it also leavens the fear and violence with an appreciation of the coolheadedness and patience that many survivors displayed, such as the young female student who saw her friend killed right next to her, then \"played dead\" beside her and remained perfectly still for over an hour as the massacre unfolded. The relative youth of so many victims comes through with piercing poignancy; whether they were university students, staff or local newspaper deliverers, they were just going about their business on what seemed like another unremarkable day. Advertisement The animation is of the type known as Rotoscoping, created by drawing over live-action footage of actors, then juxtaposing their moving bodies and faces against photographed or illustrated backdrops. This kind of animation was perfected by Ralph Bakshi in the 1970s and reinvigorated recently via Linklater's films \"Waking Life\" and \"A Scanner Darkly.\" It splits the difference between live-action filmmaking and traditional animation; the latter might use real actors as reference points for motion, but it otherwise treats the rendered characters as graphic elements in a series of moving paintings. There are some stylized touches\u2014the blood is very red, and the action sometimes shifts into slow-motion\u2014but Maitland and his animators never cross the line and allow a grotesque and senseless tragedy become something pornographically \"cool,\" which is always a risk in brutal movies about real-life massacres.  The surviving witnesses (including the police officer who shot the gunman) are all in their 60s or 70s or older now, but as they speak, it's clear that the trauma has never left the forefront of their minds. They often break down in tears recounting what happened to them. The film has no political opinion on guns or gun regulation, and that's probably wise, considering that in 1966, few municipalities gave much thought to such things, especially in onetime \"frontier\" states; nevertheless, it is impossible to watch \"Tower\" without thinking of the seemingly unending string of mass shootings that have been occurring in this country ever since, with increased frequency and escalating deadliness. The current, excellent, somewhat more political \"Newtown\" strikes similar notes, though it deals extensively with the aftermath of a shooting rather than concentrating on the event itself.  One common thread in both films is their refusal to spend much time considering the motives or life story of the killer. The killer in \"Newtown\" is never mentioned, and we only hear the name of the \"Tower\" killer once, at the very end, in a summarizing newscast snippet that goes by so quickly that you barely have time to register it. That information is, of course, only a mouse click away, so I doubt the makers of either film are trying to pretend that nobody is interested in the people who did the deed. It feels more like they're sending a statement: turning stories of evil into heroic survival narratives; denying infamy, erasing the erasers.  Advertisement"}

The problem is that they don\u2019t employ him. He repeatedly steals buses and subway trains, and drives them safely to where they need to go.\u00a0 Advertisement McCollum has Asperger\u2019s syndrome and, like many people on the autism spectrum, he has an obsessive passion that consumes much of his life. For some it\u2019s drawing, for others it\u2019s a TV show. For McCollum it\u2019s trains. \u201cEver since I was 15 years old I\u2019ve been running towards the subway system,\u201d he says. Actually, it\u2019s longer than that. He\u2019s been running to the subway since he was a small boy. It was just at age 15 that he was first arrested. At school, happy and broad-smiling but also nerdy and awkward, he was badly bullied and, one day, while he sat arranging a jigsaw puzzle, another pupil stabbed him, almost fatally, with scissors. After he left hospital little Darius became afraid of school and began to ride the subway all day. His astounding encyclopedic knowledge of trains, and his eagerness to help out, endeared him to\u00a0MTA\u00a0employees, who thought of him as a kind of mascot. After a couple of years they gave him his own miniature\u00a0MTA\u00a0uniform. When he was 12, he was allowed to operate a train under supervision, and when he was 15 a train driver who wanted to skip work to visit a girlfriend told Darius to take over for him.\u00a0 Darius drove a train safely through eight stops, picking up passengers and letting them off, and made all the necessary announcements. But someone spotted that he did not look old enough to be driving a train and so he was arrested. The incident made headlines.\u00a0 Aged 17, and then again aged 18, McCollum applied to work for the\u00a0MTA\u00a0but having the notorious teenage train bandit on staff seemed like bad PR, and he was rejected. His obsession with\u00a0New York\u2019s public transport system did not diminish. \u201cOff The Rails\u201d uses interviews, animation and dramatic reconstructions to tell McCollum\u2019s strange story but these devices are never flashy or distracting. With justice to fight for this could be an angry documentary but instead it\u2019s a gentle one. In the foreground there is always McCollum\u2019s daily life and in the background there is always the implication that a better society, one with more informed attitudes to autism and mental health, would be better able to deal with him.\u00a0 Advertisement The film\u2019s message is quiet but clear: Darius McCollum is black and neurodivergent,\u00a0and society treats him differently than it would if he were white and neurotypical.\u00a0The justice system, in particular, seems designed to chew him up.\u00a0 At one point, while McCollum is in prison for illegally driving a bus, his parents retire to\u00a0North Carolina. They hope that when he is released their son will join them. There he will be with those who love him and, away from the New York Subway System, he will not be able to steal its trains. But when he is released the conditions of his parole forbid him to leave\u00a0New York\u00a0and he is soon arrested for riding the subway when he has been banned from entering it. He goes back to jail for another year. Stealing mass transit vehicles is a major offence and so, when McCollum is incarcerated, he is sent to maximum security prisons, some of which\u2014Attica, Sing Sing,\u00a0Rikers\u00a0Island\u2014are infamous in popular culture. McCollum\u2019s crimes have never harmed anyone or even caused any real disruption to the\u00a0MTA\u00a0and yet he is imprisoned alongside gang leaders and rapists and murderers. In\u00a0Rikers\u00a0Island\u00a0he survived a riot and was scalded when another inmate boiled baby oil and poured it over him as he slept in his cell. As a prisoner, McCollum consulted with the\u00a0MTA. He advised on security and safety, and improvements were made on his recommendations. But when he was released the\u00a0MTA\u00a0would still not employ him. Even worse, while he was inside, prison authorities became concerned that his extensive knowledge of the public transport system could make him a target for incarcerated terrorists seeking to manipulate him, so he was put into segregation. Rules dictate that segregated prisoners be shackled, and so he was. Advertisement Legally, the alternative to this kind of incarceration is to argue that McCollum is insane but, if he is, then the law says he is criminally insane, and that means he would be locked away indefinitely with dangerously disturbed prisoners. To be released, he would need to be cured of his apparently incurable compulsions. And so the cycle continues. There should be a solution but the tangle of social workers and psychiatrists and judges and lawyers and the\u00a0MTA\u00a0seems unable to produce one.\u00a0 Adam Irving is on McCollum\u2019s side\u2014he would hardly have made this documentary if he wasn\u2019t\u2014but \u201cOff The Rails\u201d makes few appeals on McCollum\u2019s behalf and commits to illustrating that, regardless of how much he is abused by the system, he is narcissistic and boastful and keen on attention. But even so the evidence that we need to treat neurodivergent people better than we do keeps building.\u00a0 As I wrote this review a friend asked what I was working on and I told her McCollum\u2019s story. \u201cWhy can\u2019t someone show some common sense or compassion?\u201d she asked. This is a good question. \u201cOff The Rails\u201d asks it well. Society ought to answer."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Drop", "Review": "\u201cThe Drop\u201d is just how I like my Tom Hardy\u2013in nearly every scene.\u00a0 His notorious jailbird in \u201cBronson\u201d was just too savage. His Batman arch-nemesis Bane in \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d was too unintelligible. His recent solo tour-de-force behind the wheel in \u201cLocke\u201d was too much of a gimmick. And while this terrific British actor purred his way through \u201cInception\u201d like a randy tomcat on a hot night, there just wasn\u2019t nearly enough of him onscreen. Now here comes \u201cThe Drop,\u201d a solid, occasionally gripping crime thriller based on a short story by Dennis Lehane (\u201cMystic River,\u201d \u201cGone Baby Gone\u201d)\u2013making his screenwriting debut\u2013and directed by Belgium\u2019s Michael R. Roskam (whose unsettling \u201cBullhead\u201d was a foreign-language Oscar nominee). There is a whole lot of Hardy going on, and \u201cThe Drop\u201d is at its best when we can observe how the actor slowly peels away the layers from his character in a finely calibrated performance that builds to a satisfying full reveal in the final act. Advertisement Hardy\u2019s Bob Saginowski is a dark horse of a Brooklyn bartender who excels at keeping his head down and looking the other way whenever the Chechen mobsters who own the place launder their ill-gotten money by way of a \u201cdrop\u201d at the drinking establishment. This slice of working-class gang life is extra notable as the final film appearance by the late, great James Gandolfini\u2013perfectly fine as Marv, Bob\u2019s cousin and boss, who turns out to be the sort of desperate type that Tony Soprano would have had disposed of with nary a blink. But this is Hardy\u2019s show all the way, never more so than when he innocently corrects a humorless Marv when he refers to the gangsters as \u201cChechyans.\u201d As Bob\u2013who knows better than to insult dangerous men\u2013explains, \u201cI think it\u2019s like how you don\u2019t call people from Ireland Irelandians.\u201d Quietly compelling can be harder to do than obviously showy, but Hardy handily establishes Bob as a soft-spoken sweetheart early on as he comps shots to the regulars as they salute the anniversary of a friend\u2019s passing and allows a lonely old woman to hang out all day on Marv\u2019s special bar stool. There is a kind of gentle-giant\u00a0 masculinity in Hardy\u2019s demeanor, accented by his cuddly cold-weather attire, that recalls the early Sylvester Stallone as Bob dutifully attends Mass and sweeps up after hours. The catalyst for the plot is a late-night visit to the bar by two masked robbers, a heist that proves much more complicated than it first appears. To spill too many beans would spoil what happens, but let\u2019s just say the Chechens\u2013who have no qualms about driving around town in their work van while torturing an unlucky associate in the back as blood drips through the floor like leaky motor oil\u2013want the $5,000 that went missing and they want it now. Soon, Marv is in over his head and resorts to measures that are destined to backfire. Advertisement Meanwhile, Bob\u2019s insular life is turned around when he passes by a garbage can on the way home and hears an animal whimpering inside. Rocky Balboa had his pet turtles, Cuff and Link. And Bob has Rocco, an abused puppy who soon becomes his adorable companion. Make what you will of the fact that the dog is a pit bull, a breed that\u2013rightly or wrongly\u2013has a rep for suddenly turning vicious. But it is curious how Bob always skips the line for Communion at church, suggesting that he wants to avoid going to confession. There is also an Adrian counterpart who enters Bob\u2019s life in the form of Nadia (Noomi Rapace of \u201cPrometheus\u201d and the original Swedish version of \u201cThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\u201d), who owns the trash container where Rocco was found. A former employee at an animal shelter, she agrees to tutor Bob on how to tend to his new best friend and even offers to dog sit. Soon, he and Nadia start to become close companions as well, although he remains a gentleman throughout their time together. And, soon, he will learn that both she and Rocco used to belong to a onetime psychiatric patient and purported killer named Eric Deeds. Deeds (played by Flemish actor Matthias Schoenaerts, a standout in \u201cBullhead\u201d as well as last year\u2019s \u201cRust and Bone\u201d), who likes to unexpectedly show up at people\u2019s houses to get their attention, is determined to get both the pup and Nadia back. As the climax builds to Super Bowl Sunday\u2013when the biggest drop of the year is expected \u2013\u00a0it becomes clear that Bob, if he wants to assure the safety of Rocco and Nadia as well as hold off the gangsters, will have to make some difficult decisions.\u00a0 Roskam captures the gritty run-of-the-mill milieu, including the cluttered lower-income houses filled with a lifetime of worthless tchotchkes, and knows how to build tension\u2013this is one of those films where you expect the worse to happen around every corner and down every alley. Advertisement Not everything is perfect with \u201cThe Drop.\u201d There is an on-the-ball detective (John Ortiz, a stage veteran who was Bradley Cooper\u2019s friend in \u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u201d) investigating the robbery who suspects there is more to Bob and the situation at the bar than meets the eye, but his involvement turns out to be peripheral at best. The terrific Ann Dowd of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d barely gets a chance to make an impression as Marv\u2019s fed-up sister. And as good as Schoenaerts is, he isn\u2019t consistently convincing as an unstable creep. But if you have been itching to witness Hardy at full throttle, here is your chance. The actor should be, by all rights, at the same level by now as Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch, two other fantastically talented U.K. imports who have built up passionate cults in recent years. \u201cThe Drop\u201d is a good start. But let\u2019s hope that when Hardy takes his bow as the lead in the resurrected \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d next May, he will get the full notice and opportunities that he rightly deserves."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Fantastic Mr. Fox", "Review": "Some artists have a way of riveting your vision with the certitude of what they do. This has nothing to do with subject or style. It's inexplicable. Andy Warhol and Grandma Moses. The spareness of Bergman or the Fellini circus. Wes Anderson is like that. There's nothing consistent about his recent work but its ability to make me go zooinng! What else do \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" have in common? Now here's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox,\" an animated picture with nothing in common with traditional animation, except that it's largely in one of the oldest animation styles of all -- stop motion, the one used in \"King Kong.\" The animals aren't smaller than people but often larger, and more mature. Advertisement They live in a sometimes flat dimension; the cameras are happier sliding back and forth than moving in and out. The effect is sometimes like a old-fashioned slide projector. The landscapes and structures of this world are mannered and picture-booky. Yet the extraordinary faces of the animals are almost disturbingly human (for animals, of course). We venture into the UnCanny Valley, that No Man's Land dividing humans from the devised. Above all, their fur is so real. I've rarely seen such texture in a film. The story involves a valley somewhere, by which is meant the world, which is ruled by: Boggis and Bunce and Bean, One fat, one short, one lean.  These horrible crooks, so different in looks. Were nonetheless equally mean. Nor are the animals all saints. Mr. Fox, voiced by George Clooney, was a flourishing chicken thief until times grew risky. Then, like a bootlegger after the repeal, he went straight -- or, more precisely, into journalism. He's the Walter Winchell of the valley, until he slips back into dining on takeout chicken, taking them out himself. This he keeps a secret from the upright Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep).  His deception is blown, to everyone's great disappointment, when the fat, short and lean ones all turn into mean ones and declare war. Leading a team of other animals, Mr. Fox starts tunneling like the heroes of \"The Great Escape\" -- but in, rather than out. These adventures provide the setting for personal drama, as an uncertainty arises between Mr. Fox's callow son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman), and a cousin named Kristofferson (Eric Anderson). Kristofferson is all a fox should be, as with that name how could he not? He's the family golden child, or fox. Does Mr. Fox admire the cousin more than his son? What kind of pop has he been, anyway? Advertisement All of the animals have excellent tailoring, which adds to their stature. They're not forced to wear silly sailor suits, or like Donald Duck, never to put on pants. The art design is a large part of the film's appeal. It stays fresh all the way through. Think back to the color palettes of \"Darjeeling\" and \"The Life Aquatic.\" The film's based on the famous children's book by Roald Dahl, which like all of his work, has ominous undertones, as if evil can steal in at any moment. These animals aren't catering to anyone in the audience. We get the feeling they're intensely leading their own lives without slowing down for ours. Like the hero of \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" also based on one of his books, the creatures of Dahl's valley seem to know more than they're letting on; perhaps even secrets we don't much want to know. Children, especially, will find things they don't understand, and things that scare them. Excellent. A good story for children should suggest a hidden dimension, and that dimension of course is the lifetime still ahead of them. Six is a little early for a movie to suggest to kids that the case is closed. Oh, what if the kids start crying about words they don't know? -- Mommy, Mommy! What's creme brulee?\" Show them, for goodness sake. They'll thank you for it. Take my word on this."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street", "Review": "For many a poor orphan lad / The first square meal he ever had / Was a hot meat pie made out of his dad/From Sweeney Todd the Barber. Tim Burton's film adaptation of \"Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" smacks its lips at the prospect of such a meal, and so it should. In telling this story, half-measures will avail him nothing. The bloodiest musical in stage history, it now becomes the bloodiest in film history, and it isn't a jolly romp, either, but a dark revenge tragedy with heartbreak, mayhem and bloody good meat pies. Advertisement But we know that going in and are relieved that Burton has played true to the material. Here is one scenario that is proof against a happy ending. It has what is much better, a satisfactory mixed ending, in which what must happen, does. Along the way, with merciless performances by Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman, with a brooding production design by Dante Ferretti, with the dark shadows of Dariusz Wolski's cinematography, it allows Burton to evoke the 19th century London of Henry Mayhew's Labour and the London Poor, which reported on the dregs of London and greatly influenced Charles Dickens. The worst you've heard about Calcutta would have been an improvement on London poverty in those days. And yet there is an exhilaration in the very fiber of the film, because its life force is so strong. Its heroes, or anti-heroes, have been wounded to the quick, its villains are vile and heartless, and they all play on a stage that rules out decency and mercy. The acting is so good that it enlists us in the sordid story, which even contains a great deal of humor -- macabre, to be sure. As a feast for the eyes and the imagination, \"Sweeney Todd\" is ... well, I was going to say, even more satisfying than a hot meat pie made out of your dad. The story: In London years earlier lived a barber named Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) and his sweet young wife and child, and he loved them. But the vile Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) sentenced Barker on trumped-up charges and had him transported to Australia, meanwhile capturing his wife and child. After Turpin ravishes the wife, destroying her life, the girl Johanna (Jayne Wisner) grows up to become the judge's ward and prisoner. As the film proper opens, Benjamin has escaped from prison Down Under and sails into London with young Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower). He races through the streets to his former barbershop, where the landlady is still the dark-eyed beauty Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who sells the worst meat pies in London. She tells him about the fate of his family. He moves upstairs to his former shop, now a ruin, changes his name to Sweeney Todd and sets up in business again. Advertisement But so deep is his rage that he makes an architectural improvement: a sliding chute that will drop his customers straight into the basement after he slits their throats, so Mrs. Lovett can cut them up and bake them into her pies. Now she offers the meatiest and most succulent meat pies in London; business booms, and sometimes satisfied customers go upstairs for a haircut and a quick recycling. Burton fashions his musical in what can almost be described as an intimate style. No platoons of dancers in London squares, as in \"Oliver!\" This is a London of narrow alleys, streets shadowed by overhangs, close secrets. The Stephen Sondheim songs don't really lend themselves to full-throated performance, although that has been the practice on the stage. They are more plot-driven, confessional, anguished. Depp and Bonham Carter do their own singing, and very well, too, and as actors, they use the words to convey meaning as well as melody. There are also star turns by Sacha Baron Cohen, as the rival Italian barber Pirelli, whose singing career ends dramatically rather early in the film. And by Rickman as the judge and the invaluable Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford, his flunky. And by Jayne Wisener as Johanna and Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony, who become lovers and provide some consolation after the last throat has been slit. To an unusual degree, \"Sweeney Todd\" works on a quasi-realistic level and not as a musical fantasy. That's not to say we're to take it as fact, but that we can at least accept it on its own terms without the movie winking at us. It combines some of Tim Burton's favorite elements: The fantastic, the ghoulish, the bizarre, the unspeakable, the romantic and in Johnny Depp, he has an actor he has worked with since \"Edward Scissorhands\" and finds a perfect instrument. Helena Bonham Carter may be Burton's inamorata, but apart from that, she is perfectly cast, not as a vulgar fishwife type but as a petite beauty with dark, sad eyes and a pouting mouth and a persistent fantasy that she and the barber will someday settle by the seaside. Not bloody likely."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Sundance shorts 2012", "Review": "A pet alligator. A submarine crew going ballistic. A woman trapped in her girdle. Sometimes the idea itself is the film. That's the case with seven new shorts assembled by the Sundance Film Festival, for a bill opening Friday at venues nationwide. Almost every filmmaker starts with a short subject. Some end there. Others become great directors. What's great about programs like this is that there are countless shorts submitted to Sundance, and those selected are the very best.\u00a0 The program plays Friday through Jan 18 at the Music Box, 3733 N. Southport. Here are brief reviews of the shorts in the order they play: Advertisement \"The Eagleman Stag\": All animated in shades of white, a summary of the life of a taxonomist from the day in childhood when he noticed a wondrous worm, to the day in his 80s when his body seems to have copied a beetle's ability to generate lost body parts. Elegant in a macabre white purity. You can read it any way you like; the program informs us \"If you repeat the word 'fly' long enough, it sounds like 'life.'\" (Mikey Please, U.K., 9 min.) \"The Strange Ones\": The sound of a useless car ignition awakens a young boy. He's in a car at the roadside with an older youth, presumably his brother. They start walking down the highway and find a motel with a swimming pool. The kid jumps in. The older one makes friends with the woman running the hotel, who offers them a ride to a towing service. Then she starts talking to the younger one, and the reality goes through a shift. We no longer know what to believe. (Christopher Radcliff and Lauren Wolkstein, USA, 14 min.) \"Incident by a Bank\": Told entirely in a long shot from a POV across the street, a bank robbery is seen at a distance. We're told the film reconstructs an incident in Stockholm in 2006. As two young men drive up on a moped and hold up the bank, passers-by ignore them, and we hear the voice of whoever is holding the camera: \"Are they really holding up that bank?\" There's humor. A man comes out of a store, sees a security guard wrestling with one of the crooks on the sidewalk and asks, not very enthusiastically: \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" For some people in the area, it's as if the robbery is hardly taking place at all. (Ruben Ostlund, Sweden, 12 min.) \"Worst Enemy\": A woman has a negative self-image. She thinks she's too fat, but she's not. She takes her dog for a walk and is rudely propositioned by construction workers, who are thrown off their game when she thanks them. Back home, she struggles to get into a girdle, which fits so tightly, she needs to go to a doctor to get it off. The doctor is more than helpful. This would make a great scene in a comedy about the woman. (Lake Bell, USA, 13 min.) \"The High Level Bridge\": A short documentary about the enormous span linking the two halves of the city of Edmonton, the capital of Alberta. The narrator supplies a dry assembly of facts: The bridge is often used for suicides, one of the men who built it is entombed in one of its supports, the city fathers were going to paint it gold to commemorate Canada's centennial, but they never did. One anecdote involves a woman who slipped on a patch of ice, dropped her cell phone and indirectly saved a life. (Trevor Anderson, Canada, 5 min.) Advertisement \"We're Leaving\": Rusty and Veronica live with Chopper, their pet alligator, who seems a friendly reptile. They get a notice from an unfriendly manager that they must move in 30 days. Few rental units accept alligators. Rusty is fed up with Chopper's fondness for nicking wires and hiding them in crevices. One of the film's intriguing aspects is that I assume it is a documentary but I cannot be absolutely sure. It certainly gave me new ideas about alligators as pets. (Zachary Treitz, USA, 13 min.) \"Deeper Than Yesterday\": The weight of a feature in a 20-minute film. Takes place on a submarine after 90 days at sea. Nerves are worn ragged. Some men are on the edge of violence. (\"Piss in the shower again, and I'll kill you.\") Through the periscope, a body is seen floating in the ocean. They surface and bring it on board. It is an attractive woman, whose glittery dress suggests she fell from a cruise ship. The hero, a big man with a shaved head, who has tried to be a peacemaker, faces a considerable challenge. The director of this film knows exactly what he's doing. (Ariel Kleinman, Australia, 20 min.) Actually, all of these directors do. Filmgoers have a reluctance to attend programs of shorts, but when one is shown before a feature, they're grateful. This bill may be better, minute for minute, than most of the features at your multiplex."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Secret in Their Eyes", "Review": "There is a long tradition of Hollywood co-opting the plots of well-regarded foreign films and then snuffing out the very qualities that made the originals feel fresh, unique and eminently remake-able. While it might remove the need for those pesky subtitles, these Americanized versions too often erase such essential elements as logic, subtext and\u00a0 the sense of cultural relevance that made the title a standout in the first place. For every success like \u201cThe Departed,\u201d based on Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cInfernal Affairs,\u201d there are countless inferior reinterpretations that often count on star power to compensate for a watered-down rendition, regularly changed to a box-office-friendlier PG-13 instead of a more honest R rating. Advertisement I will never forget the first few months of 1993. That was the ultimate winter of foreign remake discontent, when moviegoers were cruelly subjected to \u201cThe Vanishing\u201d (a debasement of the same-titled Dutch chiller by the same director, no less), \u201cSommersby\u201d (which sucked much of the magic out of the French arthouse sensation \u201cThe Return of Martin Guerre\u201d) and \u201cPoint of No Return\u201d (sorry, Bridget Fonda, you are not nor will you ever be \u201cLa Femme Nikita\u201d). Well, they\u2019ve done it again\u2014and, sad to say, none too well\u2014with \u201cThe Secret in Their Eyes,\u201d 2010\u2019s foreign-language Oscar winner from Argentina. A smartly done, haunting crime thriller, revolving around a brutal 1974 rape-murder investigation that is re-opened 25 years later, the film charts the effect that the unsatisfactory conclusion to the case had on both the legal team and the victim\u2019s devoted husband. It's a reflection of the country\u2019s rampant government corruption at the time. The complicated \u201cwho, what, where, when and how\u201d aspects were handled expertly, especially a scene staged in a massively crowded soccer stadium. But what truly distinguished this superb film were the intense emotional connections brought to life by actors Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil, who look and acted like real humans, not prettified facsimiles. The agonizing unrequited love between Darin's justice agent and Villamil's department chief colored every bittersweet second of \u201cThe Secret of Their Eyes,\u201d down to the agonizing final moments. Now we have \u201cSecret in Their Eyes.\u201d (That the \u201cThe\u201d has been awkwardly ditched is just one in a pile of wrong-headed moves.) Instead of Buenos Aires, the setting is the least-glamorous portions of Los Angeles. Why L.A.? Because the flashback parts of the story now take place in 2002, when the city was thought to be the next likeliest target for a terrorist attack after 9/11. That leaves the door open for the cutting of many corners and questionable ethics in the name of security but also proves to be a distraction from the core plot. Advertisement More damaging are the casting choices. Let\u2019s start with the A-listers onscreen, beginning with Julia Roberts. There is nothing inherently wrong with changing the gender of the character that is related to the young female victim. Except that the connection involved\u2014mother-and-daughter\u2014no longer provides the same sort of echo of the unrequited love angle. That the parent is an FBI investigator initially directly involved in the case makes matters too personal for her and her co-workers. As one character rightly notes, \u201cWe\u2019re not just crossing the line, we\u2019re burying it.\u201d They also are disposing with believability as a result. \u201cSecret in Their Eyes\u201d also requires Roberts, who is kept at bay through much of the movie save for several\u00a0 showy outbursts and the twist ending, to turn down her star wattage considerably even before she is grief-stricken. Anyone who recalls Roberts in \u201cMary Reilly\u201d as Dr. Jekyll\u2019s plain-Jane servant knows how well her fans take to a cinematic frump-over of their idol. Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman as Roberts\u2019 district attorney boss has a few strong scenes, including one with intensely sexual overtones, as she strives to make finding the killer a priority despite the fact that the prime suspect is a source of intel on a terrorist cell linked to a local mosque. But she also has to be incandescent enough to cause Roberts\u2019 fellow FBI investigator, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, to gaze upon her like a googly-eyed schoolboy any time she slinks across his path. Too often Kidman, decked out in designer outfits as opposed to Roberts\u2019 grunge garb, looks like she is floating through a perfume commercial.\u00a0 As for Ejiofor, who mesmerized in \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d he is not the problem even if he has more chemistry with character actor Dean Norris as sidekick Bumpy than he does with either female cohort. Also fulfilling their duties well are Michael Kelly, who knows his way around white-collar weasels lately thanks to his memorable work as Doug Stamper on Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and Alfred Molina as Kidman\u2019s blustery higher-up. But although a surprising number of plot machinations from the original film remain fully intact, usually accounting for anything that seems remotely clever, what is missing is the type of hold-your-breath tension provided by good thrillers. Neither the camerawork nor the editing between 2002 and the current timeline manages to stir up much excitement. Billy Ray, an Oscar-nominated screenwriter for his \u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d script, deftly directed the journalism-scandal biopic \u201cShattered Glass.\u201d But he falls flat here. It may be unfair to compare the Argentine version with this inferior one, since most people probably haven\u2019t seen the first. But even when taken on its own terms, \u201cSecret in Their Eyes\u201d amounts to a disappointment. The real secret here: Reading subtitles is better than sitting through a weak imitation.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Barefoot", "Review": "Scott Speedman and Evan Rachel Wood would have been better off doing a YouTube video together where they simply make goo-goo eyes at one another than co-starring in a featherweight trifle like \"Barefoot\". Their combined cuteness quotient alone could easily top the number of hits for any cat-falling-off-a-ledge video. Certainly, it would be a lot more sensible than expecting us to believe that Speedman is Jay, a ne'er-do-well, GQ-cover-handsome son of a rich New Orleans family. He is supposed to be the sort of La-la-land reprobate who abandons an anonymous blonde in his bed with nary an adios, heads to a strip club where he is told he drunkenly gave a lap dance to an unhappy Russian guy the night before and then ambles over to a racetrack to lose money he doesn't have. Advertisement He then tops off his day by assaulting a thug at a casino where he owes thousands to a Mr. Big and, being on probation for a litany of offenses, gets to serve time mopping floors at a mental hospital.  All of this may have been somewhat plausible\u2014and watchable\u2014if Speedman gave the impression that Jay enjoyed even the slightest bit of glee from his hedonistic lifestyle. Instead, he is simply going through the bad-boy motions to presumably punish his disapproving Daddy back home by living down to his expectations while causing him to fume in his brocade-and-bougainvillea-bedecked mansion.  At least seeing a much older Treat Williams as his not-so-proud papa serves as a wake-up reminder that the film version of \"Hair\" was 35 long years ago.  With Jay in need of money to pay off his gambling debts, he decides to attend his brother's wedding so he can hit up his father for cash. Trouble is, he needs to prove he has settled down and what better way than by showing up with a steady girlfriend on his arm.  That is where Wood comes in. She is Daisy, a possibly schizophrenic patient who takes a shine to Jay and follows him out of the hospital like a stray puppy. A stray puppy who doesn't like shoes. Hence, the movie's title.  As for why the names of the characters seem to be allusions to \"The Great Gatsby\", your guess will be as good as mine. Voil\u00e0, fake girlfriend problem solved. Save for the fact that Daisy has supposedly killed her mother, who kept her sheltered at home for most of her life and only allowed her to watch VH1 (where she learned to dance), TV Land (she knows people are sometimes named Beaver) and CMT (no sign of country music knowledge, however). To top it off, she is played by Marilyn Manson's former squeeze, the adolescent hellion from \"Thirteen\". No matter. Daisy is the adorable kind of crazy that you only find in movies. The type who seems more of a flower child set free upon the universe, offering guileless joy and sunny enlightenment to all she encounters. Like a female version of Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man\" or Peter Sellers in \"Being There\" if they wore the sexy-schoolgirl clothes that Jay has borrowed from a stripper, Daisy brightens everyone's mood. Even if she panics in an airline bathroom and hysterically shrieks at how loud it flushes (OK, that sometimes freaks me out, too) and eats every packet of peanuts she can get her precious hands on. Advertisement After announcing to one and all in the most adorably unconvincing manner that she is a nurse\u2014her cover designed by Jay\u2014Daisy settles in at an elaborate pre-wedding dinner party. Despite the fact that she sniffs the pat\u00e9 appetizer and observes loudly that it smells like Fancy Feast cat food, everyone is simply enchanted by this magical creature. But for only as long as it takes Jay to tick off his dad\u2014and off the pair go on the lam cross-country but not before stealing his father's beloved vintage mobile home. Emotional pit stops along the way will include revelations about Daisy's past, the eventual redeeming of Jay's wayward habits and, of course, romance of a very sweet and chaste sort. There is one thing about \"Barefoot\" that makes it at least a guilty pleasure. Once you ignore how improbable Daisy is\u2014why is it that a girl so na\u00efve and unworldly can always have such perfect hair and just-so makeup, unless her mother also let her watch makeover shows\u2014there is something oddly captivating about Wood's performance. Unlike Speedman, who never convinces at all, she seems to be enjoying this change-of-pace role and makes you believe she could possibly turn the world on with a smile.  But instead of tossing a hat in the air, Daisy simply has to walk through an airport in a revealing shirt emblazoned with the words \"Hot for Teacher.\""}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Unknown", "Review": "Is there a term for the Paradox of Intended Accidental Consequences? That's when a movie shows something that must be an accident, and it turns out to be part of a plan. Since \"Unknown\" opens with examples of such events, it won't be a spoiler for me to discuss them. I'll bail out before the tricky stuff. As the movie opens, we meet Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife, Elizabeth (January Jones), who are on a flight to a biotechnology conference in Berlin. I'm thinking all we need to know about biotechnology in a thriller is that it probably involves either genetically altered crops or dangerous plagues. Anyway, at the airport, Dr. Harris lets a guy load his luggage, and as the taxi leaves, we get a big shot of his briefcase, still on the luggage trolley. Advertisement So OK. Was this an accident? If I'm carrying a briefcase that contains a cure for world hunger or a formula of mass destruction, I'm not gonna leave it on the curb. Anyway, Dr. Harris and his wife get to the hotel, she starts to check in, he realizes his briefcase was left behind, and without telling her, he grabs another taxi to the airport. He tries to call her, but can't get a signal. Ever had that happen to you in Berlin? A container falls off the truck in front of them, the taxi swerves and plunges through a bridge rail, Dr. Harris is knocked unconscious, but his life is saved by the quick actions of the driver, Gina (Diane Kruger). He's in a coma for four days. He pulls himself together and races to the hotel, only to find that his wife says she has never seen him before and is happily married to the \"real\" Dr. Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn). Now his ordeal be\u00adgins: How can he prove his real identity and understand the conspiracy that has taken control of his life? As a veteran thriller watcher, you can think of several possibilities here. It was all a dream. He has been brainwashed. He only thinks he's Martin Harris. He only imagined he was on a plane with the real Mrs. Elizabeth Harris. The second taxi was waiting to pick him up. And on and on. Or possibly none of the above. But let's do an instant rewind. Was it an accident he left the briefcase behind? If he hadn't, there would have been no need to return to the airport. Was the falling container an accident? Was it an accident that he got a (beautiful) undocumented Bosnian refugee taxi driver who performed a heroic rescue in icy winter waters? Was it planned that he would be able to walk into the biotechnology conference and find the (real or fake) Dr. Martin Harris? I'm thinking, if I'm an operative for some sinister secret organization and I want that briefcase and the MacGuffin it contains, here's what I'll do: I'll knock off Liam Neeson, whoever he is, and steal the briefcase. Or break into his hotel room. Or drug him. Anything. Because, think. If he isn't the real Martin Harris, why does he possess the briefcase containing the MacGuffin in the first place? But if he's a fake Martin Harris, who is the real one?  The movie has answers of a sort to some, not all, of these questions. All the same, it left me rerunning events in my mind and thinking, wait! Are we dealing with the Paradox of the Intended Accidental Consequences here, or what?  Advertisement \"Unknown\" is a skillfully photographed and acted film, and few actors are better than Liam Neeson at playing a man who has had the rug pulled out from under him. I was reminded of Roman Polanski's \"Frantic\" (1988), in which Harrison Ford played a doctor attending a convention in Paris with his wife. In that movie, the wrong briefcase was picked up at the airport, Ford stepped into the hotel shower, and when he stepped out, he found his wife had vanished. \"Frantic\" wasn't watertight, either. The basic situation (an innocent man trapped in a conspiracy he doesn't understand) was a favorite of Hitchcock's, but in his films, every consequence is intended.  I confess I felt involved in \"Unknown\" until it pulled one too many rabbits out of its hat. At some point, a thriller has to play fair. We're not satisfied when characters find it necessary to come out of nowhere and explain to the hero the underlying reality of his situation to him. Why does he need to know? Just bump him off. Whenever I hear one of those Underlying Reality Speeches, I think there should be a crawl across the bottom of the screen: This is actually the voice of the screenwriter desperately trying to explain the plot to himself.  Anyway, maybe this is all just me talking. Maybe I've seen too many movies. \"Unknown\" isn't a really bad movie, just an absurd one. It has its qualities from moment to moment. It left me with this thought: It's a damn good thing Dr. Martin Harris got that blond Bosnian taxi driver. A lot of taxi drivers, you don't get service like that."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Digging Up the Marrow", "Review": "At one point in \"Digging up the Marrow,\" a straight-faced mockumentary about a man who discovers another man who claims to have seen real-life monsters, filmmaker Adam Green (\"Hatchet,\" \"Frozen\") compares his film-within-the-film to a \"found footage film.\" Kane Hodder, the horror icon and man listening to Green's explanation, bristles: \"Found footage, huh? Like that hasn't been done before.\" That exasperated, knowing wink to viewers is a throw-away gag, but it also says more about Green's ambitions (or lack thereof) than he realizes. \"Digging Up the Marrow\" is a decent idea, but beyond some fun creature effects, and a surprisingly grounded performance from character actor Ray Wise, the film just sits there. Green, who plays a snotty version of himself, doesn't follow through on any of the ideas that make his film stand out. As a result, \"Digging Up the Marrow\" just uselessly lies there, like a cat during a heat wave. Advertisement \"Digging Up the Marrow\" begins with an ambitious, but ultimately pointless preface. Real-life horror convention guests, like \"Toxic Avenger\" director Lloyd Kaufman and \"Candyman\" star Tony Todd, tell Green about their first experiences with horror films, and why they're drawn to the genre. Other convention attendees then admit that they either believe or want to believe in monsters since many of them sympathize with monsters. After this, Green introduces himself by complaining about having to hype himself up (\"I already sound like a douchebag\"), and ragging on horror fans to his cameraman. Then Green stops clearing his throat, and gets to his film's subject: out of all of Green's fan mail, the most exciting correspondence he's received came from William Decker (Wise), an eccentric\u00a0retired Boston police officer who claims to have seen real monsters.\u00a0 Green then wastes a lot of time establishing Decker as an unreliable character. Decker tells us his story in his own time: he's a loner, divorced, highly imaginative, and also happens to have discovered a portal to a secret world of creatures. We sit and listen and wait for more enlivening details to come because, well, Green is at his mercy, and so are we. This wait-and-see strategy allows Green to back-load his special effects budget into his film's too-little-too-late conclusion, which goes pretty much exactly where you'd expect it to. Until then, \"Digging Up the Marrow\" is a lot of frantic \"Did we see something/can we see something\" conversations between Green and Decker.\u00a0 Half of these conversations are interesting because half are carried by Wise's weirdly measured performance. Wise is probably most well-known for losing his cool in \"Twin Peaks,\" a slew of decent B-movies, and a ton of unbearable SyFy Channel movies. But here, he acts like someone you probably know, maybe your grandpa, or that sketchy guy you see on the subway every morning. He talks to Green as if he's pre-planned his end of their conversation, and simply will not abide any interruptions, not now, nuh uh. In true old man fashion, Deck knows what he knows, and that's all that he knows. Wise perfectly conveys that non-philosophy every time he flails his arms in response to Green's constant questioning. Advertisement This brings us to Green, the weaker half of the film's central conversations. Green's got an annoying habit of making his character more annoying than they need to be. This was true of the pampered protagonists of his earlier films, especially \"Hatchet\" and \"Frozen,\" but there's no good reason for Green to be a self-involved jerk in \"Digging Up the Marrow.\" Green takes Decker for granted, and then repeatedly tries to exploit him, making Green a soft target for viewers' disdain. Unfortunately, Green's not supposed to be completely unsympathetic. Rather than commit to the idea that he's the film's real monster, he positions himself as a queasy mix of palatable audience surrogate and boorish human dartboard. There's not a lot to like about Green (as character), but he's in almost every one of his film's scenes, making it impossible to enjoy \"Digging Up the Marrow\" without enjoying his company. Green's creative laziness also extends to his film's best idea: Green recognizes himself in Decker's quixotic obsession with monsters. This theme doesn't really get developed. Instead, we get a lot of scenes where Green hangs out with Ray Wise in a dark, wooded cemetery. At first, you can't see much, and eventually, you don't really want to given how drawn-out many of Green's scare scenes are. Worse still, the film's monster-bait sequences all boil down to: \"What was that? I don't know! But it might have been something? Oh no, look out!\"\u00a0 There are some effective jump scares in \"Digging Up the Marrow,\" but none are worth writing home about. Wise is easily the best thing about Green's film since he doesn't require any set-up, or pay-off to be immediately unsettling. Here's hoping Green's next film is just 90 minutes of Ray Wise talking to an imaginary friend."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Up", "Review": "\"Up\" is a wonderful film, with characters who are as believable as any characters can be who spend much of their time floating above the rain forests of Venezuela. They have tempers, problems and obsessions. They are cute and goofy, but they aren't cute in the treacly way of little cartoon animals. They're cute in the human way of the animation master Hayao Miyazaki. Two of the three central characters are cranky old men, which is a wonder in this youth-obsessed era. \"Up\" doesn't think all heroes must be young or sweet, although the third important character is a nervy kid. Advertisement This is another masterwork from Pixar, which is leading the charge in modern animation. The movie was directed by Pete Docter, who also directed \"Monsters, Inc.,\" wrote \"Toy Story\" and was a co-writer on \"WALL-E\" before leaving to devote full time to this project. So Docter's one of the leading artists of this latest renaissance of animation. The movie will be shown in 3-D in some theaters, about which I will say nothing, except to advise you to save the extra money and see it in 2-D. One of the film's qualities that is likely to be diminished by 3-D is its subtle and beautiful color palette. \"Up,\" like \"Finding Nemo,\" \"Toy Story,\" \"Shrek\" and \"The Lion King,\" uses colors in a way particularly suited to its content. \"Up\" tells a story as tickling to the imagination as the magical animated films of my childhood, when I naively thought that because their colors were brighter, their character outlines more defined and their plots simpler, they were actually more realistic than regular films. It begins with a romance as sweet and lovely as any I can recall in feature animation. Two children named Carl and Ellie meet and discover they share the same dream of someday being explorers. In newsreels, they see the exploits of a daring adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who uses his gigantic airship to explore a lost world on a plateau in Venezuela and then bring back the bones of fantastic creatures previously unknown to man. When his discoveries are accused of being faked, he flies off enraged to South America again, vowing to bring back living creatures to prove his claims. Nothing is heard from him for years. Ellie and Carl (Edward Asner) grow up, have a courtship, marry, buy a ramshackle house and turn it into their dream home, are happy together and grow old. This process is silent, except for music (the elder Ellie doesn't even have a voice credit). It's shown by Docter in a lovely sequence, without dialogue, that deals with the life experience in a way that is almost never found in family animation. The lovebirds save their loose change in a gallon jug intended to finance their trip to the legendary Paradise Falls, but real life gets in the way: flat tires, home repairs, medical bills. Then they make a heartbreaking discovery. This interlude is poetic and touching. Advertisement The focus of the film is on Carl's life after Ellie. He becomes a recluse, holds out against the world, keeps his home as a memorial, talks to the absent Ellie. One day he decides to pack up and fly away -- literally. Having worked all his life as a balloon man, he has the equipment on hand to suspend the house from countless helium-filled balloons and fulfill his dream of seeking Paradise Falls. What he wasn't counting on was an inadvertent stowaway, Russell (Jordan Nagai), a dutiful Wilderness Explorer Scout, who looks Asian American. What they find at Paradise Falls and what happens there I will not say. But I will describe Charles Muntz's gigantic airship that is hovering there. It's a triumph of design, and perhaps owes its inspiration, though not its appearance, to Miyazaki's \"Castle in the Sky.\" The exterior is nothing special: a really big zeppelin. But the interior is one of those movie spaces you have the feeling you'll remember. With vast inside spaces, the airship is outfitted like a great ocean liner from the golden age, with a stately dining room, long corridors, a display space rivaling the Natural History Museum and an attic spacious enough to harbor fighter planes. Muntz, who must be a centenarian by now, is hale, hearty and mean, his solitary life shared only by robotic dogs. The adventures on the jungle plateau are satisfying in a Mummy/Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones sort of way. But they aren't the whole point of the film. This isn't a movie like \"Monsters vs. Aliens,\" which is mostly just frenetic action. There are stakes here, and personalities involved, and two old men battling for meaning in their lives. And a kid who, for once, isn't smarter than all the adults. And a loyal dog. And an animal sidekick. And always that house and those balloons.

{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Elle", "Review": "Perhaps only Paul Verhoeven would open a film mid-rape\u2014the violent attack observed by an unimpressed green-eyed cat\u2014and then follow up with a scene where Mich\u00e8le, the rape victim, face puffy from the beating, picks up a phone and orders takeout, asking questions about the \"holiday roll.\" She's not blas\u00e9 about what happened. She's freaked out. She stuffs the dress she was wearing in the trash. She takes a bath, blood from her genital area staining the bubbles above. She does not call the police. Instead, she orders food. It's hard to picture this woman shedding a tear. Ever. The opening sequence of \"Elle\" is just the start of the demented and exhilarating experience that is this movie.\u00a0\"Elle\" is a high-wire act without a net.\u00a0 Advertisement Based on the novel by Philippe Djian, adapted for the screen by David Birke (and then translated into French by Harold Manning), \"Elle\" is a maniacal and confident hybrid of various genres. It's a rape-revenge-ensemble-comedy-thriller-stalker mashup, if you can even picture that. But the film (with a couple of sick and twisted adjustments) is mostly reminiscent of the \"women's pictures\" of the 1930s and 40s, starring the shoulder-pad boss-bitches of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age, dominant dames like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck, whose characters were put through wringers involving snake-in-the-grass boyfriends/husbands, ungrateful children, career treachery. You can picture Barbara Stanwyck stuffing her dress in the trash, lighting a cigarette and then ordering takeout after being raped in the middle of her living room. You can't imagine any of those women, or Isabelle Huppert, who plays Mich\u00e8le, going to a support group or therapy. They'll gut it out on their own. The film is crowded with characters. Mich\u00e8le has a lot going on: a slacker son (Jonas Bloquet) who has an abusive pregnant girlfriend, an ex-husband (Charles Berling) now dating a young yoga teacher, a bored sex fling with a married man, an elderly Botox-ed mother (Judith Magre) carrying on an affair with a gigolo, a pressing project at work (she co-owns a video game company), a handsome married neighbor (Laurent Lafitte) whom she stares at longingly from across the street, and a complex backstory not revealed until far into the film. This woman has too much to DO to fall apart after the rape. But then she starts getting creepy texts from the unknown rapist: he knows where she is, what she's wearing. It could be anyone. Every man she knows is a suspect. She buys pepper spray (and, on impulse, a small axe) to protect herself. She says at one point, \"Nut jobs I can handle. My specialty.\" You believe her. Maybe somewhere she always expected something like this, that horror would reach out its tentacles to find her again. Verhoeven unbalances the existing tension of the \"whodunit\" aspect of \"Elle\" by giving us some pretty obvious clues early on who probably did it. Verhoeven does not \u201cbury the lede\" because he's interested in things other than the plot cranking itself out to a \"satisfying\" conclusion. He\u2019s interested in the psychology and behavior of this particular woman. His camera follows her everywhere, like a stalker, like a lover. As in life, whether we want to admit it or not, those lines are often blurred. Every interaction, not just sexual and political, contains small jostles for power, position, dominance. Who's the \"top\"? Who's the \"bottom\" in any given moment? There are competing objectives in every conversation, each side maneuvering to get what they want. Jostling for power comes in many different forms, playing out in romantic relationship, office dynamics, even in a conversation with a group of friends where you have something to say and everyone is too busy talking to give you \"the floor.\" \"Elle\" is a dissertation on power dynamics. Advertisement Verhoeven's approach is, unsurprisingly, extremely provocative. Mich\u00e8le is a woman in her early 50s, and her sexuality surges around inside her, seeking expression. It leads her into some pretty dark stuff. In real life, sex doesn't progress in a checklist of approved behaviors happening in the proper order. Sometimes people are drawn to danger, to risk. Rape fantasies are so common as to be mundane. The current view is that consent in sex is a cut-and-dry thing. Either you consent, or you don't. There is no doubt that the rape in \"Elle\" is horrifying. Verhoeven does not eroticize it. The rapist wipes the blood from Michele's vagina off of his hip bone as he gets up off of her. But later in the film, when Mich\u00e8le does consent to sex, enthusiastically, watch how her lover is unnerved by a woman who wants it, who doesn't have to be talked into it. He's almost turned off by her sexual agency. And that, ultimately, is the most cutting observation in \"Elle,\" and Verhoeven's aim is accurate and deadly. Men not knowing what to do with a woman who wants sex and knows how she wants it, men needing to be the \"top,\" always, threatened by a woman taking the \"top\" role (not in sexual positions, but in attitude) ... well. These issues have been with us from the beginning of time, and won't be solved overnight. But \"Elle\" is one of the smartest films about consent I've ever seen. Isabelle Huppert does not make even an unconscious bid for our sympathy. She never has, throughout her lengthy career and it is one of the things that distinguishes her from other actresses. Even very talented actresses want to make sure that we \"understand\" why the character does what she does. Huppert doesn't care. She's completely beyond those concerns. It's why she's so thrilling to watch and why she is in such rare company (Anna Magnani, Liv Ullmann, Gena Rowlands, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford... it's a short list). There's always some element of mystery left intact in Huppert's work. Huppert can be frighteningly blank (\"The Piano Teacher,\" \"La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie\"), she can be human and flawed (\"Amour,\" and the upcoming \"Things to Come\"). In \"Elle\" she gets to be funny, and it's such a joy to watch! It's effortless for her. She's funny in her line-readings (\"Bimbos with big tits never worried me, but the girl who's read 'The Second Sex' will chew you up...\"), in her gestures and expressions. You cannot take your eyes off of her. Neither can Verhoeven. In a Q&A following the public screening at the New York Film Festival, Verhoeven described Huppert (also in attendance) as \"unique in the world.\" She is. Watching \"Elle\" feels like climbing Everest without an oxygen tank. The air is dizzyingly clear up there. And dangerous, too."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Push", "Review": "\"Push\" has vibrant cinematography and decent acting, but I'm blasted if I know what it's about. Oh, I understand how the characters are paranormals, and how they're living in a present that was changed in the past, among enemies who are trying to change the future. I know they can read minds and use telekinesis to move things. I know they're a later generation of a Nazi experiment gone wrong, and the U.S. Army wants them for super-soldiers. But that's all simply the usual horsefeathers to set up the situation. What are they doing? The answer to that involves a MacGuffin* that would have Hitchcock harrumphing and telling Alma, \"Oh, dear, they really have allowed themselves to get carried away.\" The MacGuffin is a briefcase. Yes, like in \"Pulp Fiction,\" but this time we know what's in it. It's a drug or serum that kills paranormals. And the Division desperately wants it. Advertisement I'm not sure if the Division is part of the Army or against it. I know that the telekinetic Nick (Chris Evans) is hiding from it in Hong Kong, and that the Pusher Cassie (Dakota Fanning) finds him there and brings along the briefcase (I think), and that she's followed there by most of the other characters, including Kira (Camilla Belle) and the Division agent Henry (Djimon Hounsou), who is another Pusher. Pushing involves not drugs but Pushing into other people's minds. Kira is said to be the only paranormal who ever survived the deadly serum. But why did they want her dead? And who are they? And why is it to urgent to find the briefcase, which contains a syringe filled with the serum? This is an especially perplexing question for me, because when the syringe was being filled to kill Kira, it looked to me like the label on the bottle of medicine clearly said \"B-12,\" an excellent curative for anemia, which none of the characters has a problem with. Apart from the MacGuffin, the movie is wall to wall with the Talking Killer Syndrome. Never have more people pointed more guns at more heads and said more words without anyone getting shot. Even if they are telekinetic and can point the guns without holding them. All of these people, and others, speak very earnestly about Pushing, and they plot to outwit and out-think enemy Pushers, and clearly they are in a lot deeper than the audience is ever likely to get. It's like you're listening to shop talk in a shop that doesn't make anything you've ever seen. Dakota Fanning's Cassie claims at one point that she's \"older than 12,\" but I dunno. Her mother would probably not have allowed her to fly off to Hong Kong alone, wearing a miniskirt and sporting a hairstyle with purple streaks, but her mother has been killed, which is part of her problem. She does get a little drunk, which provides the movie's only laugh. Dakota's real mother probably told her, \"Dakota, honey, why don't you take the role, and get to see Hong Kong?\" If that's what happened, she has the best reason of anybody for being in this movie. *What is a MacGuffin?

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "In a Valley of Violence", "Review": "\"In a Valley of Violence,\" written and directed by Ti West, starts out slow, picks up speed, and finally launches itself into a screwball standoff, but always with a slapstick hilarious energy. All of the Western tropes are present. There's a loner with a mysterious past and a faithful dog at his side riding into town. There's a floozy woman holed up in a hotel. There's a dusty main square. There are sneering villains, a drunk Irish priest, a young innocent woman making gaga-eyes at the mysterious loner, and finally, a U.S. Marshal, grizzled, one-legged, and ornery, representing the thin line between chaos and civilization. Headed by Ethan Hawke as Paul the loner, and John Travolta as \"The Marshal,\" \"In a Valley of Violence\" does not take itself too seriously (a great asset), but it also takes itself just seriously enough that it's not empty snarky parody. The final half-hour is violent and gory, and the body count throughout is impressive, but West and his actors manage to find just the right tone. These situations are played for the reality of them, which just highlights the entertaining absurdity. Advertisement Paul, stone-faced and taciturn, riding through the unforgiving desert on his way to Mexico for unknown reasons, comes across a dissolute Irish priest, and is warned off entering the valley beyond those hills. There's a town in that valley, a town where chaos and sin reins. Naturally, he heads there immediately. He needs water for himself, his horse, and his dog. The town sits in the middle of the dusty desert plain, and it's empty at first glance. The church windows are boarded up (not a good sign). People peek at his approach through their windows. Paul, while having a drink in the saloon, gets into an altercation with \"Gilly\" (James Ransom), a psychopath with a fragile ego who also happens to be the son of the then-absent Marshal. Paul doesn't want any trouble, but crossing Gilly brings trouble raining down on his head, trouble that leads to an act of violence that Paul cannot let stand unanswered. Then begins a cycle of revenge, each act bloodier and more irrevocable than the last. \"In a Valley of Violence,\" in its own sneaky way, shows how ridiculous macho bluster is when unleashed with no limits. Ethan Hawke has a certain sour haunted interiority that makes him perfect for the classic Western outsider. From the second he appears, you know he has seen horrible things in his life, and done even more horrible things. He is on the run from his past, his memories. But boy, does he have an adorable dog. Abbie the dog is one of the best movie-dogs I've seen in years (running neck and neck with the dog in Jafar Panahi's \"Closed Curtain\"). The famed Asta from \"The Thin Man\" movies (and \"The Awful Truth\" among others) is the closest correlation to Abbie in terms of adorable expressiveness, and her ability to do numerous tricks. At one point, Abbie rolls herself up in the blanket because Paul informs her it's time for bed. She is Paul's only companion, and it is through his conversations with her, over a campfire at night, that his backstory is revealed. Before the revenge reprisals start erupting, the U.S. Marshal returns to town, and tries to diffuse the situation. He knows his son is a total moron. He also guesses that Paul, the mysterious stranger, is a military man. It takes one to know one. A military man is trained in the art of killing, and \"Gilly\" is just a bully of the high school jock variety in comparison. (There's an interesting commentary\u2014lightly handled\u2014on the generational and cultural divide between those who have served and those who have not.) Advertisement John Travolta, with fake leg and long straggly hair, gives one of his funniest performances in recent memory. The Marshal is intelligent, setting him apart from the lunatics who live in the town, and he becomes increasingly frustrated in his attempts to calm down the folks baying for blood. There's a great scene early on between Hawke and Travolta\u2014where the Marshal suggests to Paul strongly that he get out of town for his own good: the scene makes it clear that they\u2014shady pasts and all\u2014are the only adults in a 500-mile radius. Watching John Travolta act\u2014in material worthy of him\u2014is always a pleasure. His character work is impeccable, and in his best work there is such a palpable sense of enjoyment on his part (I am partial to his work in \"Face/Off\" for this reason) that it sweeps an audience away with him. If there's a joke to be found\u2014in a gesture, a flash of an expression, a line-reading\u2014he'll find it. He doesn't tell jokes. He reacts to the absurdity of life. In one of the big showdowns in \"A Valley of Violence,\" he tries to force his deer-in-the-headlights deputy to be brave, and the back-and-forth between the two actors during an extremely tense moment had the screening audience on the floor. Something happens when Travolta gets engaged with material and given circumstances. It's movie magic, plain and simple: hard to define or explain, but you know it when you see it. Some of the acting in \"In a Valley of Violence\" is so anachronistic you can practically see the actors' iPhones in their costume pockets. It gives the appearance that Hawke is acting everyone off the screen, but eventually it became part of the loopy rhythm of the film. The opening sequence is played pretty straight and so there is a jarring tone-shift once the plot really jerks into gear. The film relaxes when Travolta enters, and that's a bit late in the game for a film to settle in. The opening credits\u2014audacious and brash, with enormous blood-red lettering and surreal graphics\u2014is the initial clue that the film isn't meant to be taken too seriously, and the bombastic original score by Jeff Grace helps as well. (It's nice to see a film use an old-fashioned score, as opposed to lazily peppering the action with extant songs.) West's script veers between overly explanatory monologues and terrific thrown-off dialogue (\"There's no women for sale here. They all left with the silver.\") It's extremely violent and some of the violence is actually pretty upsetting. But West knows what's funny and\u2014more importantly\u2014knows how to film and choreograph events so the humor translates. It's the humor that makes the film."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Manny", "Review": "Having already accomplished enough in the ring to earn comparisons to such legendary champions as Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, Manny Pacquiao now clearly hopes to equal their achievements in the multiplex with the new documentary \"Manny.\" In the history of boxer documentaries, \"The Trials of Muhammed Ali\" (2013) and \"Tyson\" (2009) were spellbinding overviews at the respective careers of those controversial fighters; \"When We Were Kings\" (1996) took viewers behind the scenes of the classic 1974 \"Rumble in the Jungle\" between Ali and George Foreman, and was simply one of the great sports documentaries of all time. Pacquiao's shot at cinematic glory winds up missing the mark. Despite having a life story seemingly tailor-made for the big screen, it transforms his potentially fascinating tale into a narrow and borderline fawning hagiography that will no doubt find great favor among his fan base, while inspiring shrugs of indifference from those less invested in his tale. \u00a0 Advertisement Born in 1978 in the war-torn Philippines, Pacquiao lived in great poverty and was essentially supporting his entire family by the age of 12. After his family moved in with his uncle, he began to learn the art of boxing and proved to be adept at it despite his short stature and skinny frame. Before long, he left for Manila (living in the gym where he trained) and once he turned pro at the age of 16 (though he claimed to be 18 in order to get his license), he began to regularly win bouts there as well and eventually decided to seek fame and fortune in America. Within days of his arrival, he would find a trainer in former boxer Freddie Roach and win his first fight despite having less than two weeks to train and 44-1 odds against him. He would continue to win big bouts over the likes of such noted fighters as Oscar de la Hoya and over the years, he would pull off the unprecedented feat of winning world championships in eight different divisions\u2014a move that would make him an enormously popular athlete throughout the world and a national hero in the Philippines. Over the years, his success and celebrity would lead down some familiar paths, such as making a fortune even as his advisors wound up taking much of the money for themselves. There would also be unexpected detours, such as his secondary career as a star in the Filipino action film industry (including his work as superhero Wapak Man and yes, there are clips) and a decision to run for congressman back home while still maintaining his other career. Then there are the things that simply defy description, such as a love for schmaltzy love songs that at one point finds him teaming up with composer Dan Hill to perform a cover of \"Sometimes When We Touch,\" and at another has him on Jimmy Kimmel singing \"Imagine\" with Will Ferrell. This is all superficially interesting, I suppose, and the undeniable charisma of Pacquiao does help it all go down easily enough, but, in the end, I wanted more than \"Manny\" was willing to give. There is much talk about how he is one of the great fighters of all time but there is never any point in which the film breaks down in any detail what it is that separates him from other fighters. There are plenty of clips of his greatest hits but without any sense of context, they fail to make the case that boxing is just as much about skill as it is brute force. Take a film like the aforementioned \"When We Were Kings\"\u2014it took the time to illustrate what was going on in that bout that allowed Ali to triumph over the odds through illuminating commentary by the likes of Norman Mailer, a guy who did know his stuff about the sport. Here, we get starstruck commentary from the likes of Mark Wahlberg and Jeremy Piven and let me just be the first to say that whatever his qualities, Jeremy Piven is no Norman Mailer. (The lack of depth in this regard is even more surprising considering that it was co-directed by Leon Gast, who directed \"When We Were Kings.\")\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Advertisement Another big problem with \"Manny\" is that it seems way too circumspect in its depiction of Pacquiao. We never get any real sense of his life outside of the ring\u2014his wife, Jinkee, is introduced in the most offhand manner imaginable, and if his children are cited by name, I missed it. There are brief suggestions of his misbehavior outside of the ring involving booze, gambling and women that the film is unwilling to delve into in any significant manner, though it does allow him a speech at the end where he praises himself for forsaking such temptations for good. As for his political career, we get one brief comment from a rival, but, again, it refuses to probe into the accusations that Pacquiao has failed to balance his two careers, to the detriment of his constituents, in any detail. In such details, the film is so bland and toothless that the whole thing could have put together by his own reelection committee. Of course, none of this will matter much to hardcore fans of boxing in general and Pacquiao in particular\u2014they should probably mentally add another star to the rating above. However, anyone looking for a penetrating and incisive examination of the Pacquiao phenomenon will have to keep searching, because \"Manny\" is not it. Funny how a film about a man who became famous for not pulling any punches could be accused of doing just that."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Lean on Pete", "Review": "Andrew Haigh is the rare filmmaker that's\u00a0more interested in presenting viewers with fully-realized characters\u2014who feel like they existed before they came into frame and will continue to do after they leave it\u2014than any sort of high concept or twisting plot. Most writers treat their supporting characters especially\u00a0like plot devices, only fleshing them out to the degree they impact their protagonist. Not Haigh. In his masterful \u201cLean on Pete,\u201d we meet a dozen or so people whom we don\u2019t spend much time with, but who feel real. There\u2019s Steve Buscemi\u2019s irascible race horse owner, Chloe Sevigny\u2019s horse rider, Amy Seimetz cooking breakfast, Steve Zahn\u2019s homeless alcoholic, and several others who cross paths with our hero, a boy named Charlie, played with heartfelt, poignant perfection by Charlie Plummer. Again and again, I marveled at the humanist depth of the world Haigh creates, one that can only be rendered by a truly great writer and director, working near the top of his game. Advertisement The man behind the Oscar-nominated \u201c45 Years\u201d shifts gears to the Pacific Northwest in \u201cLean on Pete,\u201d where we meet a relatively average kid named Charlie. He\u2019s 15; he runs in the morning; he struggles near poverty with his single father. In the opening scenes, he mentions to his dad\u2019s new love interest (Seimetz) that the reason the cereal is in the fridge is because roaches can get to it more easily in the cabinet. It\u2019s these subtle little exchanges that Haigh so often uses to flesh out his characters without overemphasis. For the most part, it seems like Charlie is a nice, smart teenager. His life changes when he\u2019s running by a horse track one day and encounters the cantankerous Del (Buscemi), who needs help with a flat tire. He offers Charlie $10 to help him out. And then $25 a day to do other random jobs. And that\u2019s when Charlie meets \u201cLean on Pete,\u201d one of Del\u2019s gorgeous horses. Del exists on the fringe of horse racing, taking the animals to small, two-horse races, and often selling them after they succeed\u2014or, in a dire bit of foreshadowing, \u201csending them to Mexico\u201d if they don\u2019t. Charlie quickly figures out what that means.    In ways I wouldn\u2019t spoil, \u201cLean on Pete\u201d becomes something of a road movie about a boy and the horse who gives the movie its name. As the film builds momentum, Charlie\u2019s situation becomes increasingly desperate and moving, but never in a way that feels melodramatic. The main reason for that is the incredible trust that Haigh places in Plummer, placing him in the center of almost every scene in the film and asking him to carry it. This is such a subtle, beautiful performance, one that really anchors what could have so easily become manipulative garbage\u2014most coming-of-age stories that place teenagers in jeopardy are\u2014but one quickly feels like they know Charlie. Without monologues or voiceover, we come to understand why Charlie makes the decisions he does. Just as Rampling\u2019s performance in \u201c45 Years\u201d grew in power as she became even more internalized (think about her final scene in the bathroom, where she does more just by looking in a mirror than most actresses can with a monologue), Plummer has a similar arc. He becomes so fully realized that he doesn\u2019t need to explain what he\u2019s doing. We just believe it.    Part of the reason for that\u2014and this could be in part due to the fact that I have three young sons\u2014one quickly comes to care for Charlie. When this young man sees a beautiful animal who may not have many races left in him, he responds emotionally. He\u2019s not yet grown too cynical from adulthood to do so. We go with the beauty of this story in the same manner that Charlie falls for that horse\u2014it feels like we don\u2019t have a choice.    Haigh\u2019s gift\u00a0for character can sometimes overshadow his technical ability when people write about his work, but there\u2019s a mesmerizing rhythm to \u201cLean on Pete\u201d that drives the narrative. It\u2019s tempting to call it lyrical, but it\u2019s never quite that underlined. It\u2019s just something in the fabric of his films, the way he gently segues from one encounter on Charlie\u2019s journey to the next without developing that herky-jerky, episodic rhythm that so often defeats \u201croad movies.\u201d Charlie\u2019s plight grows increasingly unnerving, and yet Haigh never goes for the contrived\u00a0\u201cchild in jeopardy\u201d structure or music cues. It\u2019s really the story of someone falling into a dangerous situation because he acts with his heart\u2014he doesn\u2019t know how to do anything else.    Advertisement It sounds clich\u00e9d, but you really don\u2019t see a lot of movies like \u201cLean on Pete\u201d in a calendar year. Even films ostensibly made for an adult audience often come to them with a higher concept than \u201ca boy and horse.\u201d And so I worry that it\u2019s a tough sell for people who are going to consider it either a movie for young audiences or a manipulative melodrama. And that\u2019s something else that should further our appreciation of Haigh. He follows up a movie about an elderly, married couple at a crossroads\u00a0with that of a journey film about a runaway teen and a horse. At first, it would seem that \u201c45 Years\u201d and \u201cLean on Pete\u201d have nothing in common, but it\u2019s Haigh's power with the way people interact\u2014how they talk, what they reveal, what they choose to\u00a0hide\u2014his remarkable trust in his actors and his own storytelling abilities that tie them together.\u00a0 This review was filed from the SXSW Film Festival on March 16, 2018."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Norte, the End of History", "Review": "The\r\narrival of Lav Diaz's \"Norte, The End of History\" marks the end of a journey that began at the 2013 Cannes Film\r\nFestival, where it was the hit of the Un Certain Regard sidebar, and continued\r\non through the international circuit, where it was routinely described as a\r\nmasterpiece of staggering proportions by those who saw it. In most cases, that\r\nmuch hype can lead to ridiculously inflated expectations but with a film like\r\nthis, I would think that most people would want to go into it expecting some\r\nkind of masterwork. After all, if someone is going to go to the trouble of\r\nmaking a 250-minute-long film that begins as a Filipino riff on the\r\nDostoyevsky's classic \"Crime and Punishment,\" and then grows darker\r\nand darker until a final stretch that is among the most despairing ever put on\r\na movie screen, you don't want them to expend all that effort on a near-miss.\r\nAs it turns out, \"Norte\" is not quite the epochal work of cinema\r\ngreatness that some have suggested but it is hardly a miss either. There are\r\nmoments of staggering beauty and power on display here and yet there are also\r\nmoments when it seems to be ambling around with no clear idea of where it wants\r\nto go. Advertisement Set\u00a0in the northwest region of the Philippines,\r\nthe film spends its first hour introducing\u00a0us to its dual protagonists, two men who seem to have nothing in common\r\nother than the happenstance of living in the same area. Fabian (Sid Lucerio) is\r\na smug, self-absorbed twerp of privilege in his early thirties who was a\r\npromising law student until dropping out for vaguely defined reasons and who\r\nnow delivers endless lectures on his sub-Nietzchian theories of the world in\r\ncoffee house bull sessions with former classmates before hitting them up for\r\nrent money.\u00a0Joaquin (Archie Alemania),\r\non the other hand, is a poor but noble type with a loving wife, Eliza (Angeli\r\nBayani), and two kids whose simple dream\r\nof opening a cafe is threatened when a serious leg injury decimates his\r\nsavings. The other thing that the two men\r\nhave in common is that they are both in serious arrears to local money lender\r\nMagda (Mae Paner). One night, deciding to put his sub-Nietzschian\r\ntheories into practice (and erasing his debt at the same time), Fabian goes to\r\nMagda's house and brutally murders both her and her young daughter, who\r\ninadvertently witnessed the crime. While he flees town, Joaquin is arrested for\r\nthe murders and, after being let down by a legal system too expensive and\r\nconfusing for him to navigate, he is sentenced to life in prison. Over the next\r\nfour years, the film cooly observes as he tries to make the best of his\r\nhorrible situation while Eliza struggles to provide for her children by manning\r\na meager vegetable cart. As for Fabian, even though he has literally gotten\r\naway with murder, he is consumed with a sense of guilt that appears to drive\r\nhim to the point of madness and not even his attempts to make amends are able\r\nto stop his descent into the darkness. Although\r\nthe above plot recap may seem succinct enough, Liau and co-writer Rody Vera\r\nstretch things out to over four solid hours with most of the plot\u2014at least the\r\nstuff with the strictest parallels to \"Crime and\r\nPunishment\"\u2014concentrated in the first 90 minutes. This may sound like an\r\nabsolutely untenable running time but it has to be taken into consideration\r\nthat\u00a0Diaz is a filmmaker who uses extended running times (some of his previous\r\nfilms have clocked in at over 6 hours) as a deliberate part of a narrative\r\napproach that favors long takes and almost imperceptibly slow tracking shots\r\nover whiplash editing as a way of illustrating the slow and sometimes\r\nmonotonous rhythms of daily existence. This is an intriguing approach and there\r\nare long stretches of \"Norte\" that are absolutely spellbinding to\r\nwatch, aided in no small part from the excellent performances from the cast and\r\nthe often stunning cinematography from Lauro Rene Mands.  Advertisement \r\nThe trouble is that there are also extended\r\nsequences in which so little happens that the effect is more tedious than\r\nhypnotic\u2014there are points where the film makes Bela Tarr's \"The Turin\r\nHorse\" feel like \"Run Lola Run\" by comparison. This is mostly\r\ndue to a screenplay that grows less and less psychologically sound the further\r\nit drifts from its inspiration\u2014there is a long sequence when Eliza\r\ncontemplates killing herself and her children that feels like a cheap shot and\r\nsome of the cruelties on display in the final hour feel like attempts to jolt\r\nviewers that may have inevitably drifted off during the slower parts. For\r\nthese moments to fully work, a filmmaker has to have earned them, and there are times in which Diaz hasn't completely done that. Despite that, the end results, although uneven, are undeniably fascinating even as they challenge the viewer's stamina."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Look of Love", "Review": "In \"The Look of Love,\" a\u00a0 new biopic about British pornographer Paul Raymond, director Michael Winterbottom and screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh modestly defy the narrative conventions that they themselves use. While its creators don't go far enough to deflate their protagonist's ego, it's a smarter-than-average rise-and-fall narrative. Winterbottom and Greenhalgh only seem to go easy on Raymond (inspired comedian Steve Coogan) because their film is told from Raymond's perspective. He's presented as a self-absorbed man who has spent all of his life in the public eye refusing to be introspective. Raymond puts on a show whenever interviewed by tabloid journalists. He over-uses anecdotal catchphrases like, \"Not bad for a boy from Liverpool that came here with only five bob in his pocket,\" and insists that no press is bad press. Raymond also refuses to admit that he is a pornographer, even if he owns several strip clubs, finances all-nude theatrical revues, and distributes a Playboy-type magazine called Men Only.  Advertisement But throughout \"The Look of Love,\" Raymond thinks back to the events that led to his daughter's suicide. In the film's opening scene, he's asked by a mob of journos why his daughter Deborah (Imogen Poots) was unhappy. It's the one time Raymond's caught off-guard in the film, and he never recovers from it. Instead, he spends the rest of the film blankly replaying events in his head. At this point, Raymond is the richest man in England. But, as the film banally concludes, he only made so much money because he blithely broke off any and all emotional entanglements in his life. Raymond's tabloid-friendly life is treated as more of a tragedy than a comedy. So in a weird way, it's fitting that scenes that remind us that we're watching a series of flashbacks aren't really important. When he stares off into space, Winterbottom and Greenhalgh remind us that this is Raymond's story as told by their version of Raymond. The vacant look on Coogan's face during these brief scenes suggests that Raymond isn't really reflecting on his mistakes. According to Winterbottom and Greenhalgh, this is as close to introspection as Paul Raymond will get. That conceit makes the film's anti-materialist coda even more heavy-handed, slamming Raymond for wanting to be England's Hugh Hefner.  That said, \"The Look of Love\" takes off whenever Raymond obliviously shuns his family, colleagues, and loved ones simply because he can't deal with them. His relationship with Deborah is especially bittersweet, as in the scene where she bawls that he won't let her sing in an otherwise all-nude musical revue. He bullishly insists that has to cancel the show because, \"it's hemorrhaging cash.\" This is the highlight of the film, though there are several runners-up, including the scene in which Raymond discovers his daughter's cocaine habit, and insists that she only buy the highest-quality product.  Advertisement Raymond may not care for his wife, son, mistress, and co-workers, but he does love Deborah. Then again, Raymond treats everyone like yes-men that exist only to please him. If he can't charm the people he cares about, Raymond wants nothing to do with them. Thankfully, Deborah loves her dad, even if her love is proportional to how much he lets her get away with. The whirlwind pace of \"The Look of Love\" is a double-edged sword. Raymond doesn't want to examine his life too closely, and neither do Winterbottom and Greenhalgh. They allow anecdotal detail to illustrate Raymond's callousness, which would be more problematic if they didn't have a great collection of Raymond-related stories to tell, like when Raymond toasts his daughter at her wedding, or when he tapes a television interview with her.  This last scene is quietly devastating, but it only really pays off if you don't mind that Winterbottom is making a facile point: Deborah died because she wanted to be like her father. At first, we see Deborah talking to the interviewers about her father: \"He's my best friend, really.\" Then Winterbottom's camera reveals that Raymond is seated a few feet away from her while she's talking about him. So of course the next lines out of her mouth ruin the illusion of Deborah's sincerity. She asks the interviewers' cameraman, \"Can you tell that [my breasts] are fake?\" \u00a0\"I can't tell,\" the cameraman says. \"I wasn't looking too closely.\""}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Hitler's Hollywood", "Review": "\u201cHitler\u2019s Hollywood,\u201d which bears the subtitle \u201cGerman Cinema in the Age of Propaganda: 1933-45,\u201d is the second documentary director Rudiger Suchsland has made about German movies prior to the collapse of the Third Reich. The first, \u201cFrom Caligari to Hitler,\u201d was based on the groundbreaking 1947 book of the same title by Siegfried Kracauer, which surveyed the cinema of the Weimar Republic and thus includes many of the masterpieces by Lang, Murnau, Pabst, et al. that Western cinephiles have studied and enjoyed for generations. Advertisement The new film is different from its predecessor in that hardly any of the movies it covers will be familiar to viewers outside Germany, and only one, a very controversial display of Nazi triumphalism by Leni Riefenstahl, can be remotely considered a world-cinema classic. With that distinction made, the first thing to say about \u201cHitler\u2019s Hollywood\u201d is: it\u2019s quite a show\u2014a cavalcade of images, icons and ideas that, while less innovative, are every bit as eye-popping in their own way as \u201cThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\u201d \u201cNosferatu\u201d and \u201cMetropolis\u201d are in theirs. Which is not to say that the Third Reich\u2019s cinema was the breeding ground for auteurs that the Weimar years had been. On the contrary, Suchsland makes the claim early on that Nazi Germany had a single auteur: Joseph Goebbels. Hitler\u2019s Minister of Propaganda (whose years in the post coincide exactly with those covered by this film) was the consummate master of totalitarian thought control. He was in charge of radio, propaganda, and all branches of the arts; but as he considered film the most important of these, he exercised complete control over the production of German movies, right down to the particulars of scripts and casting. Germany produced over 1000 movies in the Nazi era, and relatively few of these were pure propaganda. Riefenstahl\u2019s \u201cTriumph of the Will,\u201d ordered by Hitler himself to celebrate the consolidation of his cult at the 1934 Nuremberg rally, was, as Suchsland notes, an incredible fusion of eroticized imagery and editing with quasi-religious spectacle using geometric masses of people much as the Nazi entertainment films would. The notorious \u201cJud Suss\u201d (1940), ordered by Goebbels himself, was virtually an order for Germans to slaughter Jews; seen today, one of its crucial scenes uncomfortably recalls the racism of D.W. Griffith\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation.\u201d Advertisement But it\u2019s the entertainment films here that exercise the greatest fascination. Some are obviously meant as pure escapism, while others embed\u2014subtly or not\u2014propagandist ideas or messages in their fictional stories; and there\u2019s quite a lot of gray area between the two categories. Death and the nobility of dying for the fatherland were recurrent themes, even before the war began. And though families are idealized, the idea of subjugating the individual to the mass was constantly stressed. In one early Nazi propagandistic drama, a boy who distances himself from his Communist father to join the Nazis is valorized, and naturally ends up dying nobly with his eyes fixed on a swastika banner fluttering above him. Hitler, it is said, was holed up at home watching Mickey Mouse, Frank Capra movies and musicals, which led Goebbels to try to Hollywoodize some of the Nazi cinema. But Germany already had an advanced industry for producing entertainment movies, and \u201cHitler\u2019s Hollywood\u201d provides countless examples of its technical sophistication. Horror and fantasy films were out (they might take viewers too close to underlying psychic troubles, it is suggested) but musicals, melodramas, romances, military and adventure movies were among the genres that flourished. There are only a few glints of Teutonic comedy here, though, and Suchsland wryly notes the films\u2019 almost \u201ctotal lack of irony.\u201d Though Marlene Dietrich had already decamped for Hollywood, and Ingrid Bergman, aged 23, passed through and made one feature which she later regretted, Germany had a fully developed star system that evolved throughout the period. As in Hollywood, there was a vogue for foreign stars, especially females from countries including Sweden and Hungary. The names of these accomplished performers are too numerous to list here, but their work is well worth discovering, and I think I share with Suchsland a fascination with two in particular: Gustaf Grundgens, an actor whose work remains stunning in its daring and skill; and Ilse Werner, whose looks and very modern elan might have made her a star in Hollywood or the French New Wave. Advertisement Of the directors whose work is most frequently seen here, very few saw their careers ended by the collapse of the Third Reich; most went on to work in post-war Germany (even \u201cJud Suss\u201d director Veit Harlan, who claimed he was just following Goebbels\u2019 orders and actually toned down the film\u2019s antisemitism). And it\u2019s not like Germany was completely bereft of auteurs. As we see, G.W. Pabst, having failed to escape in time, made \u201cParacelsus,\u201d which looks like a medieval allegory of irrationality rampant. And then there\u2019s the case of Detlef Sierck. Someone should make a doc exploring the connections between his work in Germany and the movies he was acclaimed for after he moved to Hollywood and became Douglas Sirk. Suchsland judiciously quotes Kracauer as well as Hannah Arendt and Susan Sontag, and in the film\u2019s narration\u2014voiced by Udo Kier\u2014he touches on themes having to do with mass psychology and the German soul, wondering what elements continue today even though many people might prefer to think they have been left behind. Yet most of these ideas are rather superficially invoked (other issues, like Goebbels\u2019 hostility toward the church, are overlooked entirely); treating them in depth obviously would require a much longer film or series. (Suchsland reportedly plans a third film covering the post-WWII cinema.) Finally, one can\u2019t watch this film and not think of events in the world today. How did the German nation get so caught up in the Nazi mythology that it plunged willingly toward its own destruction? Obviously being seduced away from a clear comprehension of reality into self-regarding mass fantasy was a big part of it. As \u201cFox & Friends\u201d\u2014I\u2019m not talking about a Fassbinder movie here, folks\u2014and similar phenomena today suggest, the credulousness and suggestibility that lead to such disasters is not just a German condition.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Rum Diary", "Review": "In the early 1960s, after he had discovered booze but before he had stumbled across drugs, the young Hunter S. Thompson got an uncertain start in journalism. By the time he was 20, he had already been fired as a copy boy for Time magazine for \"insubordination\" and from the Middletown (N.Y.) Daily Record for destroying the office candy machine. He moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, seeking a job on the San Juan Star, where he was turned down. This career path looks marginally sunnier in \"The Rum Diary,\" based on a novel he wrote in the early 1970s. The story goes that Johnny Depp found the manuscript among Thompson's papers in his Colorado cabin on Woody Creek, and was instrumental in getting it published and now produced as a film. The writer-director, Bruce Robinson, was a good choice, having already directed a landmark, \"Withnail & I\" (1987) about an alcoholic who was Thompson's equal \u2014 or inferior, or superior, whichever fits. Advertisement The film opens as the ambitious young hero Paul Kemp (Depp), sporting a white suit, a straw hat and the dark glasses Thompson would wear for a lifetime, applies for a reporting job at the Star. It doesn't appear to be the kind of paper that attracted the ambitious in those days. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins), the editor, spots him for trouble and immediately asks him how much he drinks. \"The high end of social.\" He is the only applicant for the job and gets it. He falls in with Sala (Michael Rispoli), the paper's veteran photographer, and Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi), a shambling wreck who has been fired but still hangs round the newspaper office. San Juan in those days appears to have been a lively little metropolis in which a reporter on an English-language newspaper was a stranger in a strange land. One of Kemp's stories concerns Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a property developer who has grown rich through shady deals, and occupies a palatial beach home where he entertains local investors. The movie is cast as autobiographical, assuming that Thompson had been given the job in the first place. He was a writer with lifelong trouble with deadlines, not a good trait when you're one of the few reporters on a daily. For all the movie makes clear, Kemp may have been the only one. He is of great value to the snaky Sanderson, however, because what appears in a newspaper has the illusion of fact, and Sanderson hopes to bribe him to write favorable coverage of his property schemes. This he does with a shiny red Corvette to match the shiny red lipstick on his mistress, Chenault (Amber Heard), who is Kemp's for the taking. One suspects Kemp could have been bought for far less. Depp has a deep attraction to Hunter Thompson, who he played earlier in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" (1998). Thompson was apparently good company; my friend Bill Nack, an otherwise sensible man, logged time with him covering prizefights and liked him. The mystery involved how Thompson possibly consumed so many intoxicants and hallucinatory drugs, lived until he was 67, and wrote a great deal of invaluable prose, most of it turned in late. Thompson had a speaking style that Depp re-creates accurately in \"The Rum Diary.\" He mutters in a low voice, as if marginally short on breath, or as if fearful of jarring something loose inside his head. He never seems particularly drunk, but sometimes it's more like he went through drunk and came out the other side. Advertisement There is the dim purpose, in the film and I guess in the novel, that Kemp is fighting corruption in the form of American money being used to defraud Puerto Ricans. This is no doubt his purpose, but his mind is so muddled and his days so haphazard that he often seems to be drifting toward a vaguely seen destination. The mistress Chenault is played by the sensuous Amber Heard as a woman who is tired of Sanderson's wealth and ego and inexplicably drawn to Kemp's shabby life and disreputable friends. True, Sanderson is a rat and Kemp is a crusader, but a girl like Chenault doesn't finds herself living with a millionaire on the beach if she has a taste for shaky drunks. We have the feeling that Kemp/Thompson saw much of life through the bottom of a dirty glass and did not experience it with any precision. The film duplicates this sensation, not with much success. The difference between Kemp and Withnail is that Withnail is seen from outside, partly through the eyes of his horrified friend. As Kemp loses focus, so does the story.  I can imagine a tightly written newspaper story set in San Juan and populated with colorful characters, but Paul Kemp's view seems clouded by his uncertain perception. At the film's end, we're informed that Kemp saw that the bastards got what was coming to them, but I suspect San Juan was much the same when Kemp (and Thompson) left."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Finders Keepers", "Review": "\u201cFinders Keepers\u201d is the odyssey of a rogue amputated leg, as found in a grill that was left for months in an abandoned storage locker. After its discovery, two men from Maiden, North Carolina fought for custody of it. John Wood\u2014small, sunny-eyed and low-key\u2014was the biological owner of the leg; it was removed from his body after a plane crash, and months later, after his own ways of trying to preserve it (as a memorial for his father who died in that crash) he ditched the leg in that infamous smoker. However, Shannon Whisnant, towering and with a melodic drawl, was the one who technically bought the grill, and the leg that came with it; he used the public\u2019s curiosity about the event, the grill, and the foot to become a bit of a local celebrity. (In pure poetry, Shannon has a bum left leg, the same side as the amputated limb). The two took their odd but straight-faced quarrel to international media, eventually leaving the foot\u2019s fate up to an appearance on reality TV court show \u201cJudge Mathis.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement Needless to say, this is a story that tells itself. If some documentary filmmakers are like gold miners, scouring to find a phenomenal nonfictional story within heaps and heaps of less-interesting ones, \u201cFinders Keepers\u201d is that piece of gold which directors Bryan Carberry and J. Clay Tweel were lucky to find before anyone else did. This is a story that comes with rich, fascinating subjects, atmosphere, fantastic dialogue, (\u201cHe thought he was gonna be, y\u2019know, the next Billy Bob Thornton!\u201d) insatiable costume design, and a bizarre chain of events, all waiting for a documentarian\u2019s vision (as is often the case, fiction film could never do this justice). At one time, this was the type of pursuit that led to Errol Morris\u2019 \u201cGates of Heaven.\u201d Now, in the spirit of that albeit untouchable film we have \u201cFinders Keepers,\u201d a fantastic story that touches upon all-American notions of celebrity, redemption, family, justice, class, meme culture\u2014all which came together with a kooky news segment. \u00a0 This Sundance 2015 selection and winner of \u201cBest Comedy\u201d at the 2015 Traverse City Film Festival is a ridiculous story indeed, as John\u2019s mother Peg will state herself, or the grin on his brother-in-law Tom will nudge, as he shares his talking head offerings like he were about to finish telling a joke. But \u201cFinders Keepers\u201d succeeds with a staggering amount of empathy when its narrative focuses on more than a prized foot, and centers on two men experiencing life phenomenons bigger than them. The film invests a lot of time in talking head reflections of John's addictions, and the apex of self-destruction he hit because of the money and attention given to him by the foot fiasco. Meanwhile, Shannon tries to understand his degree of celebrity, boasting big dreams of becoming a beloved, wealthy entertainer through his reality show appearances; a fantastic but crushing moment in the third act shows Shannon experiencing first-hand a reality show audience\u2019s attention span for him as \u201cThe Foot Man.\"\u00a0 Inserted news reports label these eccentric events as a \u201cfreak show\u201d but \u201cFinders Keepers\u201d unquestionably resists a mean spirit. This doc doesn\u2019t get into the type of designation of heroes and villains, as previously chosen previously by one of its producers, Seth Gordon, who broke into filmmaking with 2007\u2019s \u201cKing of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters.\u201d (Although that doc\u2019s nemesis Billy Mitchell does get an \u201cAwesome Thanks\u201d in this film\u2019s closing credits). \u201cFinders Keepers\u201d wisely and warmly treats John and Shannon, both Davids to society as a Goliath, with a caring touch, expressing their very human nature defined by the comedy and tragedy within each. Their story is immensely entertaining, but the lunacy of these events is never out of their own understanding.\u00a0 Advertisement Carberry & Tweel are pretty sharp as to how much the story tells itself, and often don\u2019t mess with its natural order. On the other hand, aside from some driving score choices, or some select, pretty shots of B-roll, it\u2019s as if the filmmaking loses personality to the eccentricities of everyone on screen. And in terms of assembly, \u201cFinders Keepers\u201d is a tad messy\u2014we know that reenactments were filmed earlier than the leads\u2019 dominating interviews (per Shannon\u2019s haircut as a time mark), but we aren\u2019t sure where the filming exactly takes place in the overall foot saga, especially as the impressions John and Shannon have on each other seem to change throughout. It\u2019s an unnecessary distraction that overcomplicates a story that proves to have a beautiful, simple grace.\u00a0 In a very rare reflex even for the\u00a0movies I already treasure, I was moved to watch \"Finders Keepers\" again immediately after the first viewing.\u00a0This documentary is just so welcoming\u2014and for events that defy believability\u2014that I wanted more time in its atmosphere (the 83-minute running time is still just right). Sometimes you just find something that grabs ahold of you.\u00a0 In one of \"Finders Keepers'\" greatest gifts, it is inspiring how clear and clean the filmmaker's\u00a0intentions are, especially against public opinion's regular impulse to quantify unusual headline subjects as memes from a 15-minute circus (the film wonderfully continues the\u00a0ideas\u00a0from the end of \"Amy,\" which is also one of the best documentaries of the year). \"Finders Keepers\" is able to pack in all of this bizarre tale's inherently kooky colors\u2014and have a great deal of fun with them\u2014but its heart is\u00a0always in the right place."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Red Sparrow", "Review": "Jennifer Lawrence is tied to a chair, beaten and tortured. She is the victim of rape and attempted rape. She is forced to strip naked in private and in public. She is slashed, stabbed and has a gun put to her head. Ostensibly, such graphic ordeals are intended to demonstrate the physical and psychological fortitude of her character, a Russian spy named Dominika Egorova. But ultimately, these shocking and violent sequences become repetitive and gratuitous, making \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d feel more like a cheap exercise in exploitation than a visceral tale of survival. Advertisement Surely there\u2019s more to spycraft than knowing the perfect spot to caress on a target\u2019s thigh, or how delicately to whisper into his ear. But this is about the extent of the training she receives. (Oh! She also learns how to pick locks.) Dominika is right when she complains that she\u2019s been sent to \u201cwhore school\u201d alongside other attractive and tough-minded young people who are being molded to serve Russia\u2019s secret intelligence. What she endures is more than just degrading\u2014it\u2019s destructive. And as a solitary tool set, it wouldn\u2019t seem to prepare her for the many dangers headed her way. \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d which Francis Lawrence directed from Justin Haythe\u2019s script, is based on the novel by Jason Matthews. But it\u2019s impossible to watch it without comparing it to last summer\u2019s stylish and kinetic \u201cAtomic Blonde,\u201d another physically demanding espionage thriller starring Charlize Theron. That film truly was about female empowerment\u2014about a woman using every inch of her body to achieve her goals while also having agency over her fate. The fact that Dominika is told early on that her \u201cbody belongs to the state\u201d\u2014which was the case long before she started training to be a spy\u2014makes her the object of constant leering, and that male gaze gives \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d a skeevy vibe from which it never deviates. Director Lawrence also worked with Jennifer Lawrence (no relation) in the last three \u201cHunger Games\u201d movies, so he\u2019s familiar with putting his exceedingly capable star through the wringer. She\u2019s certainly game for it all (despite her wavering accent.) But aside from some shocking bursts of violence, he directs \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d with a surprisingly dull sameness. That overall bland tone, coupled with the film\u2019s unnecessarily long running time, makes this would-be thriller less than thrilling. It begins with promise and verve, though, as we see Dominika at the height of her powers in her former life, performing as a prima ballerina with the Bolshoi Ballet. The great Ukrainian dancer Sergei Polunin plays her partner; sadly, he barely gets to show off his formidable abilities. But he is crucial to the on-stage accident that ends her career with a fall and a crack. (It\u2019s one of many gory moments that\u2019ll make you flinch and cringe in your seat.) Advertisement Dominika\u2019s career-ending leg break also means the end of her ballet-sponsored housing and medical care that her ill mother needs. Right on cue, her uncle Vanya (yes, Matthias Schoenaerts really plays a character named Uncle Vanya) steps in with a proposal. He\u2019s a high-ranking member of the Russian secret intelligence agency, and he has recognized cunning and scrappiness in her since she was a child. He thinks she can make herself useful to the state in order to protect her home and her mother. That\u2019s right. He sends her to whore school. Charlotte Rampling, the cruel and emotionless leader of the training center (it\u2019s actually called Sparrow School), teaches Dominika and her classmates how to manipulate people by seeking out their weaknesses, using their charms and becoming whomever they must to get the assignment done. Rampling\u2019s character, known only as Matron, gives a speech to the class about how the West is weak, tearing itself apart with racial divisions and social media obsessions, and how it\u2019s Russia\u2019s time to step in and assert itself as the ultimate world power. This is about as close as \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d comes to addressing the renewed Cold War between Russia and the United States. (I guess a whole movie in which Jennifer Lawrence sits in a Moscow office building pumping out anti-Hillary Clinton Twitter bots would\u2019ve been hard to market.) There\u2019s not nearly enough of Rampling, however. (Similarly, Jeremy Irons and Ciaran Hinds help bolster the strong cast in small roles as top Russian officials.) That\u2019s because Dominika soon gets her first assignment: She must travel to Budapest and cozy up to a CIA officer named Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton), who\u2019d been working in Moscow, and find out the identity of the mole who was his contact inside Russian intelligence. Lawrence and Edgerton suffer from a woeful lack of chemistry together, a component that\u2019s essential to determining whether the entire movie works. The way they dance around one other\u2014flirting, feeling each other out\u2014provides some intrigue and suspense at first. But they drop their facades far too quickly, and the ensuing romance has barely any spark. They never make us believe the sacrifices they\u2019re willing to make for each other; we just have to go with it as the plot chugs along. Advertisement Thankfully, there\u2019s Mary-Louise Parker, who provides a much-needed respite from this slog. She has a quick but significant supporting role as the chief of staff to a United States senator who\u2019s too drunk to realize she\u2019s not\u00a0nearly\u00a0as slick or savvy as she thinks she is. She finds herself in over her head while trying to sell secrets to the Russians and ends up getting squeezed in the midst of a power play between various double-crossing agents. It\u2019s the film\u2019s most suspenseful segment. And for one brief, glorious moment, she breathes life into a movie that never truly takes flight."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Tour De Pharmacy", "Review": "Cycling mockumentary \u201cTour De Pharmacy\u201d doesn\u2019t aim to be more than pure, uncut silliness\u2014composited of famous faces in goofy wigs and irreverent humor\u2014and that hardly proves a deficiency. With a running time of 39 minutes, it's double the length of Louis Malle\u2019s famous and much more serious Tour De France short doc \"Vive le Tour,\" but it can be just as captivating in its own way. Written by Murray Miller, this treasure trove of goofy gems is about the Tour De France in 1982, in which an entire roster of racers was knocked down to five once it was discovered that everyone was doping. Director Jake Szymanski\u2019s film focuses on the five that remained. Characters include Daveed Diggs\u2019 Slim Robinson character, who is obsessed with being known as \u201cthe first black something,\u201d like his famous uncle, Jackie. Then there\u2019s Andy Samberg as Marty, the \u201cfirst African\u201d to join the Tour De France, even though it becomes clear that he\u2019s a obnoxious American kid who only lives in Niger because his parents own a diamond mine. John Cena plays an aggressive Austrian rider who in the previous year was skin-and-bones before he did steroids; Freddie Highmore portrays a woman (portrayed by Julia Ormond in modern-day interviews) who pretended to be a man in order to race. With its main characters in particular, \"Tour De Pharmacy\" gets a lot of mileage with the way it pokes at the white male privilege at the center of such a sporting event.\u00a0 Advertisement As a sports narrative, Szymanski vaguely follows the bizarre events of this very fake race but lets the comedy be steered by character development and hilarious side observations from talking heads. Like his previous tennis mockumentary \"Seven Days in Hell,\" the taste for straight-up silliness thrives well beyond its initial sport.\u00a0 Explaining what is specifically funny about a film like this is like listing off musical notes to describe a melody, but I can say that what the film wants to do it does very well; the revolving door of celebrities playing oddball characters is always a great factor, my biggest laughs coming from the legendary Maya Rudolph and the immaculately droll Nathan Fielder. It\u2019s a surprising ensemble of brief cameos here and there but has the neatness where performances are fleshed out for the time they are needed. There are plenty of other people of note, too, like Jeff Goldblum, Dolph Lundgren, Kevin Bacon, Danny Glover, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and even J.J. Abrams (the latter who can be seen singing the praises of \"Juwanna Mann.\") The only unamusing talking head? Lance Armstrong, whose appearance as a doping expert is like a teeth-gnashing epilogue for his sleaziness in real-life documentaries like \"The Armstrong Lie.\" The 39-minute running time is one feature that nags the project, despite the story's intention to be as fleeting as it is goofy. It has such adrenaline that you imagine it could be longer, and the movie doesn't give much to take away aside from memories of laughing. But for a small project that merely wants to be silly, it comes down to speed: a good feature comedy is roughly laugh-a-minute stuff, and this does well with its half-length\u2014a laugh every 30 seconds, often a big one, sounds about accurate. As a piece of entertainment that primarily aims to distract and delight, it\u2019s can\u2019t-pass-up goofiness."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "7 Boxes", "Review": "Everything has a price in Juan Carlos Maneglia and Tana Sch\u00e9mbori's \"7 Boxes\". You want something? You better have something to trade, be it information, money (hard to come by), or one of those nifty new cell phones with a video camera. \"7 Boxes\" takes place in a 48-hour period within the sprawling Byzantine maze of a Paraguayan market. Everyone knows everyone. It is 2005. Cell phones are still a novelty, let alone ones that can take pictures and videos. You could do anything if you had one. They are currency. Currency, and what it means in different situations, is the underlying theme of \"7 Boxes\", its urgent motor. The brutality of capitalism is not critiqued by any of the characters because they are too concerned with survival to worry themselves over concepts, but the implications are clear. You can't get anything in this world, drugs for your sick child, a girlfriend, a cell phone, without currency.  Advertisement Victor (Celso Franco) is a kid who works as a delivery boy in the market. He has a rickety wheelbarrow and he hustles customers to let him carry their goods. Victor is young and wily. He's also captivated by anything that has a \r\nscreen: security cameras, used televisions, his friend Liz's cell phone \r\nwith a video. He wants one. He has no money. So when he is suddenly offered a weird gig by a sleazy butcher to transport seven boxes with contents unknown away from the butcher's shop (surrounded by cops), he jumps at the chance. Unbeknownst to Victor, another guy named Nelson (V\u00edctor Sosa) was supposed to get that delivery job, only he was late for the pick-up. Nelson, a desperate man with a sick son, sets out to find Victor and steal the seven boxes so he can collect the payment which he sees as rightfully his.  There's nothing like a strong set-up, and the set-up in \"7 Boxes\" is powerful, simple and dramatic. What is in the boxes? Why are they so important? Cops prowl through the market, but they are as corrupt and on-the-make as everyone else. Everyone can be bribed. Cell phones are passed around, from pocket to pocket, and, in one funny scene, a cell phone is stolen, and Victor, thinking he's calling the butcher, gets the thief instead. \"Can I speak to Mr. Dario?\" \"This is my phone now. I'm the thief who stole his phone.\" \"Oh, okay. Bye.\"  Victor has a sister (Nelly Davalos), who works in the kitchen of a Korean restaurant, and a friend named Liz (Lali Gonzalez), who tags along with him, but other than that his whole world is his wheelbarrow and the market, as well as the pull of any television screen in his vicinity. No matter how tense the moment is, Victor stops in his tracks to stare at the images, commercials, American movies dubbed in Spanish, and even himself on security-camera footage. What is it he sees? Escape? Wealth? Fame? Whatever it is, it represents the irresistible allure of a life where currency is available, up for grabs, where there's more than enough money to go around. Victor has no resentment about his poverty. He is too busy trying to survive being chased by Nelson and by the cops. But he is pulled up and out of himself, through the technology proliferating around him in endless screens.  Advertisement As it becomes clear to him that the seven boxes are bad news, and that he is in serious trouble, he hides the boxes. That doesn't work out well. Liz steals the boxes, to help him out, and then he steals them back. Meanwhile, Nelson has gathered together a gang of desperate people willing to help track down Victor in order to get a piece of Nelson's payment. The chase takes them through the market, its random dance clubs, and lunch counters, its back alleys, and warehouse spaces. Some of these scenes, crowded, busy, frenetic, are reminiscent of some of Jafar Panahi's films, with their use of actors who don't seem like actors at all racing through real-life urban settings.  Victor is on the run, but he has nowhere to go. He never leaves the market. But as the competing circles close in on him, as the seven terrible boxes loom in portent, he and his friend Liz huddle against an iron gate, hiding, and suddenly, impulsively, he leans in and kisses her. He obviously had wanted to kiss her for a while. Their relationship is the teasing annoyed banter that screams romantic tension. But perhaps he saw a movie star kiss a girl like that once, and perhaps it gave him courage, it showed him how.  \"7 Boxes\" is both a tense and frightening crime film as well as a sometimes-dreamy evocation of life in the sprawling underclass, its hallucinatory aspects, its chaos and violence, its fantasies."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "12", "Review": "\"Twelve Angry Men\" remains a monument of American filmmaking, and more than 50 years after it was made, its story is still powerful enough to inspire this Russian version -- not a remake, but a new demonstration of a jury verdict arrived at only because one of the jurors was not angry so much as worried. \"12\" by Nikita Mikhalkov is a powerful new film inspired by a powerful older one. You know the story. A jury is sequestered. The men are hot and tired, and impatient to go home. It is assumed that the defendant, a young man accused of murder, is guilty. A quick vote is called for. The balloting shows 11 for convicting, one against. This generates a long and dogged debate in which the very principles of justice itself are called into play. Advertisement Perhaps Russia got this film when it needed it. Reginald Rose's original screenplay was written for the CBS drama showcase \"Studio One\" in 1954 and presented live. Franklin Schaffner (\"Patton\") was the director. The telecast took place during the declining days of the hearings held by Sen. Joseph McCarthy. CBS also broadcast the Army-McCarthy hearings, and Edward R. Murrow's historic takedown of the alcoholic witch hunter. The great film by Sidney Lumet, made in 1957, now stands at No. 9 on IMDb's poll of the greatest films, ahead of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Casablanca.\" If the original story argued for the right to a fair trial in the time of McCarthy's character assassinations, the Russian version comes at a time when that nation is using the jury system after a legacy of Stalinist purges and Communist party show trials. It also dramatizes anti-Semitism and hatred for Chechens; the youth on trial is newly arrived in Moscow. The issue of overnight Russian millionaires in a land of much poverty is also on many of the jurors' minds. None of the jurors is given a name, although director Mikhalkov gives himself the role of the jury foreman. One by one, every member of the jury tells a story or reveals a secret. Their set-pieces do the job of swaying fellow jurors to reconsider their votes but are effective on their own as essentially a series of one-man shows. There is not a weak member in the cast, and it's a tribute to the power of the actors that the 2\u00bd-hour running time doesn't seem labored. The jury is sequestered in the gymnasium of a school next to the courtroom, and they never leave it, but their stories are performed so skillfully that in our minds, we envision many settings; they're like radio plays. Lumet famously began his film with the camera above eye level and subtly lowered it until at the end, when the characters loomed above the camera. Mikhalkov, with a large open space to work with, uses camera placement and movement instead, circling the makeshift jury table and following jurors as they wander the room. A sparrow flies in through a window, and its fluttering and chirping is a reminder that the jurors, too, feel imprisoned.  Going in, I knew what the story was about, how it would progress and how it would end. Mikhalkov keeps all of that (writer Rose shares a screen credit), but he has made a new film with its own original characters and stories, and after all, it's not how the film ends, but how it gets there.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "A Touch of Sin", "Review": "\"May you live in interesting times\" is the familiar Chinese saying, usually spat out as a curse. You can see why in \"A Touch of Sin,\" a film by renowned director Jia Zhang-ke. That kind of time is now, in the history of his country. With four vignettes inspired by real-life \"ripped from the headline\" events, he shows what the great economic expansion of China is doing to the majority of its people. It's not a pretty picture, but it's a compelling one. The four stories track a furious miner who goes on a rampage against a company head, a migrant worker who returns home for his mom's 70th birthday, a young kid from the provinces who can only find work in an exploitative factory or a brothel, and a massage parlor receptionist (played by Zhao Tao, the director's real-life wife). Jia's view is of a country with corrupt managers and government officials. It also points up the undeniable income disparity topping even that of the U.S. Still, the displaced and marginalized traverse the country, trying to get some piece of the pie. Or some job. Advertisement Worse yet, greed has trickled down to everyone. One of the nastiest ironies is that Dahai, the miner played by Jian Wu, gets a tongue-lashing for his idealism by a character reminding him that at least the executive has made it into upper ranks, and out of their village. Dahai tries to fight some injustices, such as the mine owner failing to honor his promise to share some profits with his workers. Nothing doing, though, so when the embezzler visits in his private jet, Dahai goes bonkers with a gun. In perhaps the most memorable sequence, the docile-seeming receptionist (Tao) is set upon by a patron of the \"sauna\" where she works. He literally beats her up with money trying to force her into another job description: a masseuse/hooker. Finally, she turns the tables, brandishing a knife in a way to best any kung fu master.  Signature strokes of a great filmmaker come through even in a \"message\" movie. Startling images shot in high definition digital show the old agrarian China smashed up against the new. A horse pulling a cart without a driver goes the wrong way down a highway. Bulls peer placidly at the urban scene. But you have to know a bit about China, which most of us don't, to get that the four stories are set in different parts of this huge country: a cross-section is implied. One is clearly in the north, though, as we can figure from the snow, and characters often chat about where they are from, or guess each other's dialects. It's a world in flux.  Those who follow news in China will catch on to the televised glimpse of an incident involving a high speed train wreck, \u00a0a disaster the Chinese government kept on the down-low. That the film is showing these things at all is some sort of minor miracle. Jia's films have been suppressed for number of years, yet he decided to go ahead and try to pass the censors this time (he did). The script for \"A Touch of Sin\" won best screenwriting award at Cannes this year. His earlier films include \"Still Life\" which showed an ancient river being wiped out as part of a dam project, and \"24 City,\" a kind of oral history about condo development and the loss of 20,000 jobs.  Advertisement Those films are calm in tone compared to the explosive \"A Touch of Sin,\" with its wilder-than-the-Wild West beginning as a traveler is set upon by roadside thugs. He's ready for them, vigilante- and Tarantino-style, presaging the steam of rage which erupts into violence throughout the film, sometimes graphically. A mangled ear was too much for a couple audience members at the screening I attended, or maybe they couldn't get into the storylines. There is no segue from one sequence to another, though in fact the movie is tied up in a nearly novelistic fashion, with plot threads coming together cleverly at the end.  If you have the stomach for it, \"A Touch of Sin\" is a stunning travelogue of cruelty and vengeance. Even if you can't relate to the anthology-like narrative and would have preferred to spend more time with individual characters, the film's glimpses of China today intrigue. Smaller towns now have a neon sheen. The countryside is strewn with humming construction equipment re-making the landscape. Even the brothel where a displaced factory worker (a poignant Luo Lanshan) finds work has its moments. Catch the spectacular march of sex workers in theatrical costumes being paraded before the cash-rich patrons; don't blink or you'll miss a witty cameo with the director as one of them.  None of this may want to make you go to China. \"A Touch of Sin\" is hardly an invitation to look-see. It does explain some of the contradictory information we've gotten: spectacular wealth and growth, but terrible factory accidents, low wages, and human abuse issues. It's also a kind of plea to the Chinese government. I'm always suspicious of a movie where you have to have a creator's quote to figure things out, but Jia, who was on hand for a Q & A at the screening, had an apt one. \"The expansion in China has been so fast,\" he said, \"there's been no room for the system to catch up with any kind of humanity.\" Advertisement"}

She\r\nhas a lot to keep quiet about, although thank goodness, she eventually opens up\r\nor the movie wouldn\u2019t have a second half. I will not reveal what she says, of\r\ncourse, because her surprise is part of the fun. I am willing to divulge some\r\nof the setup, with Ray coaching Hancock to start saying \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cyou\r\ndid a good job here,\u201d and stop flying down out of the sky and crushing $100,000\r\ncars. Ray also gets him a makeover: Gone is the flophouse wardrobe, replaced by\r\na slick gold leather costume, and Hancock gets a shave, too. Does it himself,\r\nwith his fingernails. He\r\nappeared some 80 years ago in Miami, as far as he knows. He doesn\u2019t know very\r\nfar. He has no idea where his powers came from, or why he never grows any\r\nolder. He can fly at supersonic speeds, stop a speeding locomotive, toss cars\r\naround, and in general, do everything Superman could do, but not as cleanly,\r\nneatly or politely. Part of his reform involves turning himself in to the law\r\nand serving a prison term, although the chief of police has to summon him from\r\nprison to help with a bank hostage crisis. (In prison, there\u2019s a guy named Man\r\nMountain who must not read the papers, or he would never, ever try to make\r\nHancock his victim.) Advertisement It\u2019s\r\nnot long after the bank hostage business that Mary reveals her secret, Hancock\r\nstarts asking deep questions about himself, and the movie takes an odd,\r\npenetrating turn. This is the part I won\u2019t get into, except to say that the\r\norigin stories of superheroes consistently underwhelm me, and Hancock\u2019s is one\r\nof the most arbitrary. Even Mary, who knows all about him, doesn\u2019t know all\r\nthat much, and I have a shiny new dime here for any viewer of the movie who can\r\nexplain exactly how Hancock came into being. Not\r\nthat it matters much, anyway. I guess he had to come into being somehow, and\r\nthis movie\u2019s explanation is as likely as most, which is to say, completely\r\npreposterous. Still, \u201cHancock\u201d is a lot of fun, if perhaps a little top-heavy\r\nwith stuff being destroyed. Smith makes the character more subtle than he has\r\nto be, more filled with self-doubt, more willing to learn. Jason Bateman is\r\npersuasive and helpful on the PR front, and it turns out Charlize Theron has a\r\ngreat deal to feel odd and penetrating about."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom", "Review": "Evgeny Afineevky\u2019s \u201cWinter on Fire: Ukraine\u2019s Fight for Freedom\u201d is the latest Netflix-backed documentary that, like \u201cThe Square\u201d before it, converts a popular political uprising into stirring real-life drama. Though the film is limited by a point of view that\u2019s too polemically reductive, the idealistic, difficult, sometimes lethal struggles it covers are undeniably revelatory and moving. \n A Russian-Israeli filmmaker now based in Los Angeles, Afineevsky led a large crew (dozens of cameramen are credited) that observed the revolt against Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych centered on Kiev\u2019s Maidan Square for 93 wintry days in late 2013 and early 2014. That footage, some of it quite amazing, might be called the film\u2019s first stage. The second comprises interviews with participants that were filmed after the revolt\u2019s conclusion and intercut throughout the film. The third stage, as it were, involved bringing in longtime David Fincher editor Angus Wall (who also produces docs for Errol Morris) and certain associates to polish and shape the film into one that would be comprehensible and appealing to Western audiences. Advertisement \n The Wall team\u2019s contributions are evident in the film\u2019s opening, which gives a succinct account of the Maidan revolt\u2019s background: Yanokovych, a corrupt autocrat of the most blatant sort, had been promising an economic agreement with the European Union that would help further integrate Ukraine, which declared its independence from Russia in 1991, into Europe. When at the last moment that agreement wasn\u2019t forthcoming, Euro-inclined Ukrainians took to Maidan Square to protest. \n The first day, alerted by Facebook posts, about 2,000 people gather. Their numbers continue to grow with each passing day, and their central demand is that Yanukovych resign. Beginning on the tenth day, the government begins fighting back\u2014literally. During the night, Berkut troops, as the military police are known, attack the protestors. The violence \u2014and the defiance of it\u2014escalates steadily during the coming weeks, as the black-armored and helmeted Berkut are joined by paramilitary thugs and plastic bullets give way to live ammo. \n The film emphasizes the diversity of the protestors, which include people from all over Ukraine and many different walks of life, from professionals to students to laborers to clergy. Additionally, many different faiths are united with non-believers, while Ukrainian nationalism and pro-European, anti-Russian sentiment form the common thread. The frequently used interview segments not only help chronicle and explain the revolt as it unfolded, they also give us a sense of who these protestors were, as well as their sincerity and dedication to their cause. \n The dedication leads to displays of courage that sometimes are quite astonishing and form the film\u2019s fiery emotional core. Refusing to back down or flee no matter how many merciless troops and deadly bullets come flying at them, many protestors deliberately put themselves in harm\u2019s way, and some pay the ultimate price for helping wounded friends. Finally, some 125 die and hundreds are wounded before Vanukovych buckles from the turmoil and flees the country. \n Seeing people putting their lives on the line for \u201cfreedom\u201d can\u2019t help but be powerful and inspiring, and the film emphasizes how much of this commitment came from the generation of the '90s, who came of age after the yoke of Soviet domination had been removed. Once people have tasted freedom, Afineevsky suggests, it\u2019s hard to get them to return to tyranny. Advertisement \n \u201cWinter on Fire\u201d offers a more conventionally presented and factually informative account of the Kiev uprising than Sergei Loznitsa\u2019s alluringly formalistic \u201cMaidan.\u201d Yet it misses a wider view that might have complicated and undercut its noble but simplistic unity-of-the people uplift. We hear almost nothing of the influence of foreign powers in the Ukrainian struggle, and very little of what was going on within the Ukrainian Parliament at the time Kiev\u2019s streets were roiling. Yanukovych, after all, was popularly elected, and what one side would call a \u201crevolution\u201d the other side would deem a \u201ccoup.\u201d\u00a0 \n Indeed, the film would be better if it helped us understand why one side in Ukraine inclines toward Europe while another leans toward Russia. The Maidan uprising, after all, didn\u2019t lead to a peacefully unified country. It led to new elections and leaders, but also to a de facto and ongoing civil war in which over 6,000 people have been killed."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Illegal Tender", "Review": "Even as the teenage girlfriend of a South Bronx drug dealer, Millie DeLeon is the investment adviser you'd want on your account. Without telling him, Millie invests his profits in Microsoft. This was in the late 1980s. \"I only made one mistake,\" she tells her son years later. \"I didn't buy enough.\" What she bought, however, was enough to turn $2 million into a fortune, and as the story jumps forward 20 years Millie (Wanda DeJesus) is living in an elegant suburban home, and one of her sons, Wilson DeLeon Jr., is attending Danbury College, pulling down 4.0 grades and is in love with a student named Ana (Dania Ramirez). He also dotes on his kid brother Randy (Antonio Ortiz), who is by a different father, because Wilson DeLeon Sr. got gunned down in a mob grudge on the day he was born. Advertisement They lead a life both comfortable and dangerous, as Millie realizes in the supermarket one day when she is spotted by a hit woman from her past. In a panic, she races home, tells the boys to start packing because they're moving again and sets a revenge tragedy into motion. \"Illegal Tender\" was written and directed by Franc. Reyes, who is fascinated by the zero degrees of separation between low and high finance. Reyes' first film was \"Empire\" (2002), about another young South Bronx kingpin fascinated by the lifestyle of a flashy Wall Street wonderkid. His protagonist this time comes closer to making an escape, but the bad guys from his mother's boyfriend's past have long memories, and more reasons than we think for wanting her and her family dead. My advice to her would be twofold: Move to a suburb a lot farther away from the Bronx than Connecticut, and do not give your son his father's name with a \"junior\" tacked on. How many Wilson DeLeon Juniors can there be who are not the offspring of the Wilson DeLeon? Never mind. This movie is based on drama, not logic. Otherwise four or five hit men would not come calling in broad daylight and open fire at the outside the DeLeon house. Hit men are supposed to be more clever than that, no? And is it possible they could all, every last one, be wiped out by a fortyish housewife and her son whose entire gun experience consists of shooting three cans off a rock in only about 11 shots? And all before the cops arrive? A running gun battle in a rich suburb usually gets a pretty quick response. We're not thinking a lot about things like that, however, because the dynamic of the movie circles DeJesus and her passionate performance as a mother who wants to protect her family. The other main strand is how Wilson Jr. evolves in a short time from Joe College to his father's son. This journey takes him back to Puerto Rico and a search for his father's past. \"How come you speak such good Spanish?\" the kingpin asks him. \"I'm Puerto Rican,\" he says. \"Yeah,\" he says, \"but most Puerto Ricans from New York speak lousy Spanish.\" I wanted Wilson Jr. to explain, \"Plus, I got a four-point average in Spanish at school.\" Advertisement Like his \"Empire,\" \"Illegal Tender\" has the potential to be a better film than it is. Reyes obviously wants to make a rags-to-riches story about a Puerto Rican kid from the streets who climbs the American financial ladder, and almost equally obviously he doesn't really want to sell it to Hollywood as a guns-and-drugs movie. I urge him to just go ahead and do it. The film's producer, John Singleton, whose own life has taken him from Los Angeles outsider to the top in Hollywood, would probably support him. And if it's true that Reyes has his act so together that he shot this good-looking film in only 28 days, he could do it at the right price. As it is, \"Illegal Tender\" works as a melodrama, and it benefits enormously from the performance of Wanda DeJesus. She isn't a big movie star, but so good that she's cast by them and works with them in major roles; she co-starred with Clint Eastwood in his \"Blood Work,\" has been cast in major roles by such directors as Michael Mann, Laurence Fishburne and Joel Schumacher, is all over \"CSI: Miami\" and has real screen presence. She sells us her character and her concerns, and with this screenplay, she has her work cut out for her."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Gods of Egypt", "Review": "They don't make movies like \"Gods of Egypt\" anymore, and yet they never made movies like \"Gods of Egypt.\" This is the paradox, and for a while, it's a fun one. But after a point, this proudly silly film about gods and mortals in ancient Egypt devolves into an sword-and-sorcery-flavored riff on a weak Marvel movie. The alternately cornball and self-aware dialogue and the clearly not state-of-the-art CGI would seeming charmingly retro (like something from a TV miniseries two decades ago) if the movie didn't trot out one epic action film cliche after another.\u00a0 Advertisement Gerard Butler stars as Set, god of disorder. He wrests control of his kingdom from his brother, Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in an opening hand-to-hand combat sequence where the siblings clang swords and beat on each other for a while, until they both assume the form of armored creatures that look like Marvel-movie android warriors and leap through the air, knocking each other against pillars until Set finally tears Horus's eyes out. (Why the combatants don't assume super-powerful form to start with is one of those questions that films like this never answer.)  At first, Set wants to kill Horus outright, but relents when the goddess Hathor (Elodie Yung) begs him to be merciful. Set banishes the blind Horus to a crypt where he's eventually set free by the intrepid mortal Bek (Brenton Thwaites), a resourceful thief whose beautiful young lover, Zaya (Courtney Eaton of \"Mad Max: Fury Road\"), died from an arrow wound and is now trekking through the underworld en route to her final judgment. According to lore, only the king of Egypt can free a dead person from the between-state and return them to the land of the living. That means Horus has only a few days to wrest control of the kingdom from Set. If he doesn't, Bek's girlfriend will stay dead forever.  That's a pretty good setup for an action-adventure: a coup on a timetable. The director, Alex Proyas (\"The Crow,\" \"Dark City\"), seems sure of what sort of film he wants to make. Despite the ostentatiously virtual images and the comic book and borderline science-fiction touches, in its heart \"Gods of Egypt\" is an adventure in what used to be called the \"swords and sandals\" genre. Every brawny chest is waxed, every bosom heaving. The characters address\r\n crowds of thousands of (digital, alas) extras, and run their enemies \r\nthrough with swords and spears and zap them with death rays (hey, some \r\nof them are gods, okay?), and swear fealty to this and vengeance against\r\n that, and tromp around in metal tunics while saying things like, \"Why \r\nwas I made to walk on burning sands while my brother strolled barefoot \r\nalone on the shores of the Nile?\" and \"Give me my eyes!\" and \"Were you \r\nusing my house for your fornicating?\"  Advertisement It's stocked mainly with super-fit actors, few of whom are likely in the ballpark of what actual ancient Egyptians looked like, unless Egypt was populated mainly by white folks with gym-sculpted bods. Proyas sort-of-apologized last year for the casting, saying he would've hired more actors of color if it hadn't made the movie so hard to finance at the budget level he needed. As is, the most prominent nonwhite actor is Chadwick Boseman as a faintly bitchy incarnation of Thoth, the father of science, religion, philosophy and magic. Nevertheless, it's a good cast. Nobody's phoning it in. They're all present and laying it on with a \r\ntrowel, including Rufus Sewell (star of \"Dark City\") as the architect \r\nUrshu\u2014who has the snitty defiance of a young Tony Curtis\u2014and \r\nGeoffrey Rush as Set and Horus' grandfather, the sun god Ra, who lives on an\r\n orbital platform in space, and spends eternity using his sun-bolt lance\r\n to zap a giant black leviathan-worm that wants to eat its way \r\nthrough the planet. (No point using this movie to cheat on your mythology \r\nfinal, kids.) Most of the lines in Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless' screenplay are delivered straight, without winks, even if they're clearly meant to provoke applause or knowing laughter. (Perusing the skyscraper-sized tower Set ordered Urshu to build for him, he asks, \"Could it be any taller?\")\u00a0 \"Gods of Egypt\" has a vision, cockeyed though it may be. There are airborne chariots drawn by winged beetles \r\nand flocks of birds, an Indiana Jones-style treasure trove rigged with \r\nbooby-traps, and a bracelet that repels 42 different demons. When gods \r\nare cut, they bleed gold. After Urshu walks in on Set during a post-coital moment, the newly-crowned king of Egypt rolls out of bed and dons a smoking jacket covered in multicolored metal beads; it looks like something Prince would wear to a bar mitzvah.  It's a shame that \"Gods of Egypt\" is unable to resolve key conflicts except by having characters fight \r\non top of pyramids and mountaintops while the camera whirls around them, or run away from theoretically enormous yet oddly \r\nweightless monsters and falling objects, just like every other big budget action film clogging up multiplexes. Things fly this way, things \r\nfall that way; people leap through the air on wires and yell \"Aaaauuuugggggh!\"; Dolby digital sound \r\neffects go boom and creeeeaaaaak and boooosh and the editing \r\ngoes cut-cut-cut-cut to hide that few of the images are composed strikingly enough to linger on. The movie could have been a work in the mode of \"Barbarella\" or\r\n \"Flash Gordon\" or \"The Sword and the Sorcerer\"\u2014larks that \r\nwere cobbled together from scraps of their decade's cinematic and design and fashion cliches, yet formed into works of true personality, films that were simultaneously self-aware and innocent. But the repetitious, unimaginative action kills the charm.\u00a0  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Attack the Block", "Review": "Fireworks fill the sky over London, creating such a distraction that an alien crashes to Earth unnoticed. Meanwhile, in a dark bypass, a young nurse is being mugged by a gang of teenage street thugs, their faces buried within fearsome, hooded sweatshirts. Their straightforward situation grows complicated when the alien attacks them, and the nurse decides she'd be safer staying with the thieves. That's the setup for \"Attack the Block,\" an entertaining thriller in the tradition of 1970s B-action films, with an unknown cast, energetic special effects and great energy. That it takes place almost entirely around a low-cost London housing estate (i.e., project) adds to its interest, because as the junior thugs band together to fight the aliens, they stop being faceless and emerge as sympathetic individuals who discover their resources. This alien attack may have been a learning experience dropped from the heavens. Advertisement The movie, which should have been titled \"Defend the Block,\" illustrates once again that zombie, horror and monster movies are a port of entry for new filmmakers. The genre is the star. Unknown actors are almost an advantage. Darkness and quick cutting make up for a great deal in the area of special effects. What is needed is imagination. When John Carpenter made \"Assault on Precinct 13\" early in his career, he demonstrated an invaluable formula to later low-budget generations.  This is an impressive first feature written and directed by Joe Cornish, a British comic actor who has also authored the forthcoming Tin-Tin movie by Spielberg. Here he shows a strong sense for characters as the personalities of the gang members, their neighbors and friends emerge sharply. He's made a fortunate discovery in John Boyega as Moses, the de facto leader of the pack and the quickest to figure out the greater dimensions of the alien invasion. Moses' knowledge of the block and its residents and his ability to deal with people turn out to be crucial. Cornish creates a mixed bag. We meet the local crimelord, the block's drug dealer and, revealingly, the family members of the gang. We see how the police leap to conclusions and unerringly arrest the wrong people for the wrong reasons. And Sam (Jodie Whittaker), the nurse, emerges from stereotyped victimhood and becomes a valuable part of the defense team. Then there are the aliens. Does it much matter what they look like? They have luminescent fangs and are very fast and are great climbers always in savage attack mode. Their design is wise; larger and more grotesque alien monsters have a way of looking goofy, as the Japanese demonstrated in the 1950s. These creatures are as efficient and low-maintenance as werewolves. The question arises about the level of their civilization. Presumably this alien race has mastered space travel and journeyed through the voice, almost necessarily at a speed faster than light, and yet they appear to lack opposable thumbs, speech and other conveniences. Of course they may not be the real aliens. They may merely be the aliens' attack animals. But no, apparently not. Such questions are beside the point. The genre calls for a mixed bag of characters to defend the fort/stagecoach/police station/pub/outpost, etc., against savage marauders, meanwhile developing their own personalities and abilities. This is a formula we've seen time and again, and in the right hands, it's foolproof. The movie has been much praised in Britain, whose writers wonder if Americans will understand the jargon of the locals. For that matter, would the Queen? It matters not. Context is all, and the language here is no more difficult than the coinages in \"A Clockwork Orange\" and \"The Warriors.\" The question is, do the action and the characters work well together? The answer is yes. And sometimes it gets a little funny, too. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Battleship", "Review": "\"This could be like Columbus and the Indians,\" a nerdy radio astronomer worries. \"Except we're the Indians.\" From a powerful transmission facility in Hawaii, he's supervised the transmission of a signal to the Earth-like Planet G in another galaxy, and in no time at all, aliens come calling. Considering that they arrive in weeks, they must have discovered faster-than-light speeds, so it's a little strange that when they arrive they're strictly analog. Their vast warships splash down in the Pacific (except for fragments that devastate Hong Kong in one of those toppling skyscraper scenes so beloved in disaster movies). But these alien crafts are only armed at a level that makes their battle with U.S. warships more or less a standoff. Advertisement Why would the U.S. fleet conveniently already be near the splashdown point? It's involved in war games with allies such as Japan, which provides an excuse for a Japanese officer to take temporary command of one of our ships and thus boost the grosses of \"Battleship\" in Asia. It's also handy that the aliens create a force field that forms an impenetrable barrier around their craft, which seals in three U.S. ships, locks out all other ships and explains why our jets don't simply nuke the SOB.  Of course, in the old B-movie tradition, our response to the alien visit is immediately military. There's not one word of discussion about the aliens possibly just making a social call. We invite them, they come and we open fire. This despite the fact that they're remarkably humanoid; when we finally remove the helmet from one alien's spacesuit, he turns out to look alarmingly like James Carville. In the set-up, we meet a shiftless beach bum named Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch), whose brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) is a naval officer. In a bar, Alex hits on the lithesome Samantha Shane (Brooklyn Decker), who wouldn't you know is the daughter of the admiral of the fleet (Liam Neeson). Breaking into a convenience store to get her a burrito, Alex is arrested and his brother delivers an ultimatum: Join the Navy or else. Meanwhile, the nerdy Cal (Hamish Linklater) supervises transmission of the signal to Planet G, and in no more time than it takes to get Alex into uniform and on board a U.S. destroyer, five alien spacecraft enter our solar system in tight formation. One alien craft then levitates from the ocean depths, as large as a skyscraper and bristling with ominous protrusions. You gotta say it takes real nerve for a communications officer (Rihanna) and two seamen to speed over to it in a rubber boat armed with just a machinegun.  In a parallel story, we learn Samantha is a physical therapist working with the Army vet Mick Canales (real-life Iraq hero Gregory D. Gadson). She takes him on a hike up the mountainside where the big NASA radio dishes are located, they meet the nerd, and much depends on preventing the aliens from phoning home. In the Pentagon situation room, officials fret. There's the obligatory montage of cable news reports on the alien invasion, and the U.S. destroyers exchange fire with the aliens. Two ships are destroyed, including the one commanded by Stone, and after several officers on Alex's ship die, he turns out to be next in command and becomes the captain of the surviving U.S. destroyer. So that's convenient. The characters we met at the beginning all become the key players. Advertisement \"Battleship\" is based on the Hasbro board game of the same name, unplayed by me. You get a sense of that when radar doesn't work, and Rihanna figures out a way to deduce the underwater movements of the alien craft by tracking wave patterns on a grid with old-fashioned weather buoys. The film eventually comes down to lots of scenes in which things get \"blowed up real good.\" One alien weapon is especially fearsome: a large metal ball with spikes, which rolls through things and flattens them. Were less sophisticated versions of this used in medieval times, maybe made of flaming tar balls? The film is in the tradition of the \"Transformers\" movies, also based on Hasbro games, and you get the feeling that Hasbro showed director Peter Berg some Michael Bay movies and told him to go and do likewise. To his credit, \"Battleship\" is a more entertaining film than the \"Transformers\" titles, because it has slightly more fully fleshed characters, a better plot and a lot of naval combat strategy. The work of Gregory D. Gadson, as the disabled vet, is especially effective; he has a fierce screen presence. Rihanna is as convincing as the character allows, and Taylor Kitsch makes a sturdy if predictable hero. But the nicest touch is that \"Battleship\" has an honest-to-God third act, instead of just settling for nonstop fireballs and explosions, as Bay likes to do. I don't want to spoil it for you. Let's say the Greatest Generation still has the right stuff and leave it at that."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Bite", "Review": "\u201cBite\u201d is a low-budget body horror film complete with\r\nwarnings about having better friends and not marrying men you don\u2019t really\r\nlove. It\u2019s got echoes of \u201cThe Fly\u201d (and, more recently, \u201cContracted\u201d) embedded in\r\na story about a young woman scared of her future, until she doesn\u2019t really have\r\none anymore. At its best, and it gets pretty good after a really rocky start, \u201cBite\u201d\r\nis a clever gorefest with some creative twists and turns. It\u2019s one of those\r\nearly career horror entries in which the filmmakers don\u2019t quite nail the set-up\r\nor the landing, but the gooey center of the film works for those with a high\r\ntolerance for things that might make a majority of the population queasy. Advertisement Bride-to-be Casey (Elma Begovic) and her two friends Kirsten\r\n(Denise Yuen) and Jill (Annette Wozniak) are on a bachelorette party trip as\r\nthe film opens. Using found footage style, we see the girls on the beach, at\r\nclubs, in their rooms, etc. Clearly, Kirsten is the nicer of the two friends, while\r\nJill is a bit catty, and eager to film awkward, possibly even scandalous\r\nmoments. Right from the beginning, \u201cBite\u201d is drawn from the \u201ccautionary\u201d genre\r\nof horror films that teach us that if we would just never leave the safety of our\r\ncouches, everything would be OK. And if you\u2019re gonna be crazy enough to go all\r\nthe way out of the country for a bachelorette party, don\u2019t be stupid enough to\r\ngo off the beaten path. That\u2019s what the girls do one day, swimming in a\r\nbeautiful lagoon when Casey gets bit by something. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little bite,\u201d\r\nshe says. We know better. When Casey gets home, the poorly-drawn characters take\r\ncenter stage for almost long enough to sink the film. We meet Casey\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Jared\r\n(Jordan Gray), and her horrible soon-to-be mother-in-law (Lawrene Denkers).\r\nJared is the kind of two-dimensional character really designed purely as\r\nanother thing for Casey to worry about. When she returns from her trip, he\r\ngreets her with an antique high chair (he wants kids, she\u2019s not ready) and then\r\ngoes to work. The allegory of a young woman being pressured to have children by\r\na workaholic fianc\u00e9 with a horrible mother is so broad that it almost\r\napproaches parody, but not quite, so the film lingers in that in-between space for\r\na bit too long, in which we\u2019re not sure how seriously we\u2019re supposed to take\r\nthese caricatures. The acting in these early scenes is rough, and even the\r\nframing feels off. You can tell the filmmakers and performers are kind of\r\ntreading water until they get to the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d Any horror fan will tell\r\nyou, the set-up can often be more rewarding than the follow-through if it\u2019s\r\ndone well.  After the rocky first act, \u201cBite\u201d starts to find its\r\nfooting. The concept of pairing quarter-life crisis concerns with body horror\r\nstarts to click as Casey begins to notice the bite on her leg is, well, oozing\r\nand growing. There\u2019s also a bit of a sexual assault allegory in that we learn\r\nthat Casey woke up on the beach without her clothes or her engagement ring\r\nduring the trip, thinking that one of the guys she met there must have\r\nassaulted her. It's understandable that she\u2019s too traumatized and scared to respond to\r\nwhat\u2019s happening with her body. Advertisement And then \u201cBite\u201d gets crazy. Sure, there\u2019s vomiting pus, but as someone says in one of my favorite lines long after Casey\r\nhas gone full-Brundlefly, \u201cPeople always get sick after vacations.\u201d The movie\r\nclicks during a dream sequence of all things, as Casey is imagining a surprise\r\nparty of all of her friends shouting \u201cbabies, babies, babies\u201d as she gives birth\r\nto hundreds of insect eggs. It\u2019s a moment Cronenberg himself would have loved.\r\nAnd, from there, \u201cBite\u201d turns up the insanity. By the halfway point, Casey\u2019s\r\napartment is covered in egg sacs and her body is falling apart. And then people\r\ncome to check on her. The fact that anyone would walk into her cocoon-apartment\r\nand not just scream and run away stretches logic, although the film is arguably\r\nat its best when it embraces its own ridiculousness. At a certain point, it becomes clear that \u201cBite\u201d has\r\nbasically written itself into a corner, and it doesn\u2019t escape in a way\r\nthat really satisfies, but the bulk of the film is a creative, icky ride."}

Hammer is riding a wave of success and acclaim, appearing in \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d and \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d last year and about to blow people away in \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d later this year. It\u2019s easy to see him becoming one of his generation\u2019s most interesting actors. And when that happens people will come back to this relatively small thriller and appreciate how he\u2019s had the skills for some time now. Every time that \u201cMine\u201d threatens to come apart under its own pretensions (which is relatively often), Hammer does something subtle and believable to ground it.\u00a0 Advertisement Mike (Hammer) is a sniper; Tommy (Tom Cullen) is his spotter. They are on a ridge, on assignment in a dusty land, when it looks like their target is in sight. A convoy comes over the horizon, met by another group of people in the sand. Over the radio, Mike hears that their target is in the last car, but the color is wrong. Mike hesitates. What if this is the wrong guy? And the situation is complicated even further when Mike and Tommy realize that the group below them is gathered for a wedding. Is Mike really going to shoot the father of the bride at a ceremony when he\u2019s not even positive it\u2019s the right guy? He hesitates long enough that the situation goes haywire, and Mike and Tommy are forced to walk hours to the nearest village. Then Tommy steps on a land mine. And so does Mike.  Much like \u201cBuried\u201d or \u201cThe Shallows\u201d trapped their protagonist in a specific place, Mike literally can\u2019t move his left foot or risk going boom. He calls in the disastrous situation they\u2019re in and is told that someone can come rescue him \u2026 in 72 hours. He considers something daring called \u201cThe Shoeman Maneuver\u201d that involves basically digging a trench next to you and then trying to fall in it in time to minimize damage. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll only lose a leg. He has to deal with sandstorms, running out of water, and animals in the middle of the night. And then he starts going crazy, flashing back to his abusive father and a wife he left behind. \u201cMine\u201d is unapologetically philosophical. We all have land mines in our life that we\u2019re not willing to step off, dude. It\u2019s a film in which a character literally says, \u201cEvery day can be your last step.\u201d Oh, really? Thanks. In remembered moments of his past that got him here, we literally hear a mine sound, as if Mike has stepped on them symbolically before. We get it. \u201cMine\u201d is the kind of movie in which you will even likely say, out loud, \u201cWe get it,\u201d at least once. It hammers its themes and messages, and then hammers them again and again and again. Advertisement While it\u2019s clear that the filmmakers were somewhat scared of the simplicity of their concept in the way they weigh it down with flashbacks and messaging, the real tragedy is that Hammer could have pulled off a real one-man show. He does some of the hardest work of his career here, conveying both the trauma of his situation and the baggage that Mike brought with him to the desert. We believe that Mike is likely going to die\u2014eaten by animals, blown up by a mine, or simply dying of thirst. It\u2019s odd to say that Hammer gives a physical performance given he\u2019s stuck in one place, but he remarkably sells his predicament as a real, dangerous one. The film works because of him (with a shout-out to excellent editing by Filippo Mauro Boni, Guaglione, and Matteo Santi, too).\u00a0It\u2019s a really good performance from an actor I suspect will give several great ones over the course of his career."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Fifty Dead Men Walking", "Review": "Belfast, 1988. The height of the Troubles. British troops occupy the city and are at war with the Irish Republican Army. The British want to retain Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. The IRA considers them invaders. Martin McGartland doesn\u2019t much care. Like many young criminals, he is devoutly non-political. He\u2019s a two-bit hustler, stealing and reselling clothing or whatever else he can move. A wise guy, he moves confidently on the mean streets. McGartland (Jim Sturgess) doesn\u2019t like the British, but when the IRA breaks his friend\u2019s legs with a baseball bat, he likes that even less. Advertisement He\u2019s recruited by Fergus (Ben Kingsley), an officer in the Special Branch of the British police, to become a double agent, an informer. Fergus has noticed how he moves through Belfast, known to the IRA, unintimidated by the British troops. Both sides already think they know who he is. Informing on the IRA was of course a nearly certain death sentence. It seems incredible that anyone would take such a risk, and very few did. McGartland\u2019s information is credited with saving the lives of at least 50 men, and you\u2019d think the IRA might have noticed parallels between their assassination operations and McGartland\u2019s participation, but apparently not. Only at the end of the film is there a situation where his role will be betrayed, and by then, he already realizes that he will be living for the rest of his life in hiding. The Troubles were a messy business. The British troops were acting under orders that not all of them necessarily appreciated. They were not fighting in a foreign land, but against those who spoke and lived much as they did. The Protestant-Catholic hatred involved also muddied the water. To step into the middle of this was almost a foolhardy act, and \u201cFifty Dead Men Walking\u201d never really explains McGartland\u2019s decision. Still, it is a fact that he made it, even with the risk to his girlfriend and their child. The performance of Jim Sturgess as McGartland helps place his decision into the day-by-day process of acting on it. He meets clandestinely with Fergus, rises in the trust of the IRA, is able to use information he gets from Fergus to enhance his position. The two men become not friends, exactly, but mutually dependent, and as the net grows tighter toward the end, their dependence takes on an urgent desperation.  The writer and director is Kari Skogland, a young Canadian whose previous film, \u201cThe Stone Angel\u201d (2007), could not be more different. It stars Ellen Burstyn as an old lady who runs away from the children who want to place her in a nursing home. In this film, Skogland, as Kathryn Bigelow does in \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d demolishes the notion that women can\u2019t direct action. Advertisement This movie is based on real events, and a book written by McGartland and Nicholas Davies. It presents the usual disclaimers that \u201csome of the events, characters and scenes in the film have been changed.\u201d And McGartland himself has made a statement from hiding that he doesn\u2019t endorse the film and it was \u201cinspired by,\u201d not \u201cadapted from,\u201d the book. Does this reflect his hope that the IRA won\u2019t take it personally? Setting entirely aside the accuracy of the film, the IRA still has him marked for death, and indeed there was an attempt on his life in Canada 10 years after he fled. He\u2019s still out there somewhere."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "All the Money in the World", "Review": "Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d is a long-winded but engrossing kidnap thriller.\u00a0The heart of the film is a trio of lead performances:\u00a0Michelle Williams as Gail Harris, the mother of an abducted heir to the Getty fortune; Charlie Plummer as the heir, John Paul Getty III; and Christopher Plummer as the young man\u2019s grandfather, John Paul Getty, the richest man in the world at the time of the kidnapping. (The two Plummers are not related, incredibly.)\u00a0 \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d is brutal and funny in the darkest way. The dark humor comes from John Paul Getty\u2019s attitude toward his fortune. He\u2019s so miserly he makes Ebenezer Scrooge look generous. Naturally, he\u2019s the real target here; he would have to be, considering Gail is just another middle class single woman who barely has two nickels to rub together, thanks to her decision to decline Getty family funds in exchange for keeping custody of her kids after divorcing the old man\u2019s drug addicted son. \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d would be ten minutes long if grandpa would just pay what the criminals are asking for the release of his grandson\u2014$17 million\u2014instead of hemming and hawing and trying to get the price down.\u00a0 Advertisement Grandpa has reasons for haggling\u2014not good ones, but reasons. Ultimately, though, he just seems like he\u2019s not wired right. His grandson\u2019s opening narration suggests that rich people aren\u2019t actually like you and me\u2014that money has deformed their minds\u2014but the elder Getty\u2019s behavior is so repugnant on so many levels, and so profoundly dislocated from anything resembling empathy, that money alone doesn\u2019t strike me as the best explanation for his actions. I don\u2019t know if this is an unresolved complication, a basic failing of the screenplay, or a dimension that Scott and/or Plummer added to the role during shooting.\u00a0 If the latter, however, what\u2019s onscreen is more interesting than the younger Getty\u2019s diagnosis, because it means we\u2019re watching an emotionally stunted and perhaps mentally ill person with access to billions allow a blood relative to suffer just so that he can save a few bucks. In other words, it\u2019s not the money, it\u2019s him. To most of us, the stated ransom is an unimaginably huge amount, but to somebody like Getty, it\u2019s the equivalent of the coins hidden under sofa cushions. We\u2019d do whatever it took to save a loved one in similar circumstances, but John Paul the First has such an oversized dealmaker\u2019s ego that he won\u2019t take out his checkbook unless the terms are just right. Gail\u2019s tactical restraint when confronted with her former father-in-law\u2019s iciness is commendable, and Williams plays it just right, letting us see Gail\u2019s anger and frustration while making us believe that she could tamp it down out of sight when dealing with the elder Getty and his associates. What astonishing discipline this woman had! The old cheapskate acts as if this is all just a large-scale version of saving eight bucks buying a statue at a flea market. John Paul III could be murdered or tortured as a result of the stubbornness of an old man who prides himself on never meeting the first offer, and trying to save money on everything, even a transaction as basic as sending out laundry while staying in a five-star hotel (he washes and dries his own sheets to shave a few bucks off his tab).\u00a0 Advertisement Scott is relatively restrained here, letting his stars carry the day and declining to unleash the full force of his directorial power except in a handful of intricate setpieces (I won\u2019t specify which ones here, because I doubt anyone but students of the Getty family history know all the details, and a couple of them are genuinely surprising). A certain monotony sets in during the middle section, which replays too many similar beats too close together\u2014if the script were looking to combine or cut incidents, this would\u2019ve been the place to do it\u2014but on the whole this is a more-than-solid effort.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a throwback of sorts.\u00a0Adapted by screenwriter David Scarpa from\u00a0John Pearson's 1995 book\u00a0Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty, it has a welcome 1970s flavor, by which I mean that it\u2019s about recognizable human beings dealing with tense situations that feel real because they happened. The story is told in classically shaped scenes with beginnings, middles and ends, and shot mostly in real locations. The wide-format cinematography creates tension by shoving characters off to one side or boxing them inside doorways or windows and letting you wonder what unseen threats might be lurking in the rest of the frame.\u00a0 As is often the case in his non-science fiction movies, Scott splits the difference between overwhelming, almost tactile-seeming realness, and pure, uncut Hollywood fantasy, and you just have to roll with it. There\u2019s a standard disclaimer at the end of the film, stating that certain liberties were taken with the historical record. I\u2019d imagine that a lot of them had to do with placing Gail and her partner in misery,\u00a0Getty's business manager and former CIA operative Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg, who isn\u2019t terrible but does not radiate intelligence and ultimately makes no particular impression). The movie often puts the duo at the sites of dangerous activities that they probably didn\u2019t get anywhere near in real life.\u00a0\u00a0  Advertisement The film is a testament to the awesome work ethic of its 80-year old but still apparently tireless director, who fired Kevin Spacey, the actor who had originally played Getty, a month before the scheduled release date, after Spacey was accused of multiple accounts of sexual misconduct, deleted all of his footage, reshot the affected scenes with Plummer in the role and dropped them into the finished movie. This is not the best place to get into the particulars of the production\u2014they\u2019ll be nothing more than a footnote or asterisk in a couple of decades anyway\u2014but they\u2019re worth noting because the end product is much better than anyone could have expected, considering the challenges faced and met by all involved.\u00a0 In fact I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Plummer got another Oscar for this part. If he does, it shouldn\u2019t be seen merely as an acknowledgment of good work under weird and unfortunate circumstances, but as recognition of how precise and fearless he is. There is nothing likable about the elder Getty, indeed very little that\u2019s recognizable as anything but evidence of  profound, maddening dysfunction. Plummer embodies the character so completely that his Getty transcends the movie he\u2019s in, and starts to seem emblematic of the times in which the film was released, an era when money seems to matter more than mercy."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "London River", "Review": "A tall, old African man makes his way through an olive grove. A sturdy market gardener on Guernsey takes the ferry to the British mainland. They have been set in motion by the same events in 2005: Terrorists have exploded bombs on London Underground trains and a bus. They are seeking news of their children. \"London River\" tells the story of how these parents meet in the course of their journeys. It also shows a London set ajar by the cruel, senseless attacks. The searches of these parents have one thing in common: Neither one knows very much about their children, who have left home and started unknown lives in the city. Advertisement Elisabeth (Brenda Ble\u00ad\u00adthyn) learns about the bombs on the telly and calls her daughter Jane just to be reassured. We gather they don't talk often; at first, she isn't alarmed when there's no reply. She calls again and again; eventually unease grows, and she travels to London. Peering out a London taxi, she asks anxiously, \"Is this it?\" The door of Jane's flat is in a mews next to an Arabic butcher shop. The butcher (Roschdy Zem) tells her he's the landlord.  Ousmane (Sotigui Kou\u00adyate) begins his search with the imam of a London mosque, who knows the son from an Arabic class. The man sees a photo of his son with Jane and connects it with 'missing' posters Elisabeth has stuck up. He calls the number on the poster, but after meeting him, Elisabeth is hostile: What would her daughter have to do with a French-speaking old Muslim with dreadlocks? The film's development is somewhat predictable from that moment forward, but no less useful. As the parents make their separate ways through a bewildering, discouraging series of encounters with the police and people who knew their children, it becomes clear that the two young people were a couple living together. Ousmene knows even less about his child than Elisabeth knows about hers: \"I do not know my son. I did not have the raising of him.\" He'd left French Africa years ago for France, to become a forester working with elm trees. Elisabeth, a widow, raised Jane on Guernsey through working her farm. The film is a matter of Brenda Blethyn's performance vs. Sotigui Kouyate's presence. Thin to the point of gauntness, leaning on a worn wooden cane, his clothes too large, his eyes dark and deep-set, he embodies a figure of solitude. She speaks French, but their conversations begin very slowly; their guards are up because they both, we eventually learn, suspect the other's child of having misled their own. There is no evidence that either was involved in the terrorism \u2014 and indeed nobody knows if either was on the doomed bus \u2014 but as they follow a dreary route of hospitals and morgues, a dread sinks upon them. Advertisement Blethyn's character resembles in some ways the woman she played in Mike Leigh's \"Secrets and Lies\" (1996), for which she won an Oscar nomination. In that film, she is discovered by the black daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby. In this one, she doesn't know why her daughter would be dating an African or studying Arabic. She lives in insular befuddlement. \"Who speaks Arabic?\" she asks the woman who was Jane's teacher. \"Well,\" the woman smiles, \"we do.\"  The film was directed by Rachid Bouchareb, the French-Algerian filmmaker whose last two films, \"Days of Glory\" (\"Indigenes\") (2006) and \"Outside the Law\" (2010), were foreign film Oscar nominees. Both were deeply involved politically. \"London River\" is more concerned with these two searching parents. There is good news and bad along the way of Elisabeth and Ousmane's quest. Unexpected information. Gradual insights. Self-discovery. The film has been criticized by some as too politically correct. Perhaps so. But the characters' reality rises above the film's ideas and makes it human. People never think of themselves as choosing to be politically correct. They simply think in the way that they do."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Finding Vivian Maier", "Review": "In the opening scenes of Jeff Maloof and Charlie Siskel\u2019s \u201cFinding\r\nVivian Maier,\u201d its titular subject is described as \u201cparadoxical\u201d, \u201cbold\u201d, \u201ceccentric\u201d,\r\nand other words that get at the fact that the men and women who were closest to\r\nMaier in her time on Earth didn\u2019t really know much about her. In 2007, Maloof\r\nwas working on a book about his Chicago neighborhood and longed for the right\r\narchival photography. A flea market junkie from a young age, he took a risk at an auction,\r\nbidding on a box of negatives that he never ended up using and shoved in a\r\ncloset. Two years later, he developed them out of curiosity and discovered a\r\nwoman now considered one of the best photographers of the 20th\r\ncentury. When the best of Maier\u2019s work first appears in the film about her, the\r\nquality takes your breath away and sends chills down your spine. She was a true\r\ntalent. And yet Maloof and Siskel\u2019s film presents an interesting moral quandary along with its profile of an amazing photographer. When does creative ability and the desire to share a true\r\nartist\u2019s eye trump what has to be considered an invasion of privacy? Advertisement The story of \u201cFinding Vivian Maier\u201d progresses from Maloof\u2019s\r\nauction find to his scanning the developed photos into a Flickr account and\r\nrealizing that he wasn\u2019t alone in his assessment of Maier\u2019s talent. And so he\r\nwent after the rest of the story, trying not only to find the rest of the\r\nnegatives but Maier\u2019s back story, and how it impacted her photography.\r\nImmediately, significant questions haunted Maloof. Why did she never show her\r\nwork to anyone? Why did she shoot over 150,000 photos, most of them from a box\r\ncamera that she always carried around her neck and could surreptitiously use to\r\ncapture her subjects? And what\u2019s the point of taking so many photos if no one sees them? When Maloof discovers that Maier recently passed and is\r\nallowed access to her storage unit, a portrait of a hoarder becomes more\r\nclearly defined. She didn\u2019t just take 150,000 photos. She kept receipts for\r\ndecades, collected trinkets, stacked newspapers to the point that her floor sagged.\r\nShe rather quickly goes from \u201ceccentric\u201d to mentally ill, especially when\r\nstories of her relative disregard for many of the children she nannied come\r\ninto focus. (One family speaks about the photos she took when one of her wards\r\nwas hit by a car and the behavior turns to honest mental and physical abuse\r\nlater in life). She often gave fake names and some claim she used a fake\r\naccent. She wanted to be hidden, private, and reclusive. Just because she once\r\nlooked into selling photos doesn\u2019t change the mountain of behavior that\r\nsuggests that she saw her negatives and photos as something else to fill the\r\nstorage unit of memories. And now all of that is being torn down. The argument has\r\nbeen made that Maier\u2019s photos are fair game because she didn\u2019t destroy the\r\nnegatives. She didn\u2019t destroy ANYTHING. She kept receipts buried in trinkets in\r\nenvelopes in boxes. And the film raises the question of privacy regularly with\r\npeople who knew Maier commenting on how much she would have loathed this\r\ninvestigation into her life and Maloof wondering aloud if he\u2019s gone too far.\r\nSadly, the filmmakers brush it off by answering the question with their\r\nfascination with this odd, talented outsider artist. Curiosity is used an\r\nexcuse to invade privacy. Not good enough. If they had taken a strong stance and simply stated\r\nthat art is meant to be shared and displayed no matter the artist\u2019s wishes, I\r\nmight have actually agreed. But the invasive nature of \u201cFinding Vivian Maier\u201d\r\nis only briefly given lip service and never adequately handled (within the film\u2026the\r\ncreators supposedly have dealt with the issue elsewhere but this is a review of what\u2019s in the film\r\nitself and not supplemental material). Advertisement Is it possible to love the art but disagree with the way it\u2019s\r\npresented? Vivian Maier\u2019s photography is absolutely incredible and now that it\u2019s\r\nbeen unearthed and her past has been investigated, her talent should be\r\nappreciated. And so I\u2019m incredibly torn about \u201cFinding Vivian Maier\u201d overall. Should\r\nMaloof and Siskel have opened a door that a dead woman so clearly wanted\r\nlocked? I\u2019d say no (or they should have done so with more authority and\r\nartistic justification instead of just glossing over the issue with \"But isn't she interesting?\"). And yet now that\r\nit\u2019s open, it can\u2019t be closed again. Perhaps when Maloof posted those photos on\r\nFlickr, there was no turning back. And oh is it ever fascinating what is behind that door."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Saving Christmas", "Review": "Every\r\nholiday season sees a new influx of Christmas movies desperate to become the\r\nnext big seasonal perennial destined to provide laughter, tears, humanity and\r\nhealthy residuals for years to come. A majority of these films tend to\r\nfeature characters who despair that the true meaning of the season has been\r\nlost, replaced with people more concerned with having the tallest tree, the\r\nbiggest ham, the largest party and the most gifts. \"Saving Christmas\"\r\nfalls along these lines, but I must say that it may be the first one, at\r\nleast that I can recall, where that particular character is considered to be\r\nthe bad guy who wants to spoil things for everyone else.  Advertisement The full\r\ntitle of the film is \"Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas,\" and, yes, the\r\nformer teen idol turned conservative Christian evangelist/entertainer is front\r\nand center here playing himself. Set during a lavish Christmas party being\r\nthrown by his sister (Bridgette Ridenour), Kirk is rocked to his core when he\r\nasks about how brother-in-law Christian (Darren Doane, who also directed and co-wrote the film) is doing and\r\nSis tells him that Christian just isn't really in the Christmas mood this year.\r\nThis cannot stand, and when Kirk finally finds Christian, he is sitting out in his\r\ndriveway so as not to ruin the party with his mood. He confesses to Kirk that\r\nhe thinks that the true meaning of Christmas has been lost and that even the\r\nparty going on in his own house is a symbol of how things have gotten so out of\r\nwhack. \"That money spent\u2014how many kids could we have fed? How many wells\r\ncould we have dug?\" You might\r\nthink that most right-thinking people, even those who wholeheartedly embrace\r\nthe season, would have little reason to argue with such sentiment, especially\r\nwhen delivered by someone who is taking pains to keep it to himself so as not\r\nto spoil the mood. Well, Kirk has something to say about that and it boils down\r\nto \"You're all wrong\u2014you drank the Kool-Aid.\" To his eyes, every\r\ngaudy symbol of the season that is putting Christian off has deep-seated\r\nreligious roots, and only by venerating them in the most ostentatious manner\r\nimaginable can one be truly close to God. Take Christmas trees and Santa Claus,\r\nfor example\u2014even though such things are never mentioned in the Bible, Kirk\r\nuses cherry-picked Biblical details, a certain degree of extrapolation and no\r\nsmall amount of smugness (\"Last I checked, God made the Winter Solstice\")\r\nto prove his points with such stunning finality that Christian instantly\r\nrealizes that he has been the jerk all along for \"terrorizing\" his\r\nfamily by not realizing, for example, that the giant stack of presents under\r\nthe tree can suggest the skyline of the new Jerusalem.\u00a0  For a good chunk of the running time, I was more flat-out baffled\r\nby \"Saving Christmas\" than anything else. Based on the poster and\r\nsome suggestion that I heard that it would be about the so-called \"war on\r\nChristmas,\" I was expecting the film to be a comedy about someone trying\r\nto regain the meaning of the holiday in the wake of monsters who would have\r\neveryone say \"Season's Greetings\" or \"Happy Holidays'\"\r\ninstead of \"Merry Christmas.\" This might have resulted in an awful\r\nfilm\u2014though perhaps no worse than most secular Christmas-themed films you or I\r\ncould mention\u2014but at least it would have been about something, and, in the right\r\nhands, it could have actually inspired some big laughs here and there. Instead,\r\n\"Saving Christmas\" is little more than a screed delivered by Kirk\r\nCameron scorning everyone who doesn't celebrate the season as ostentatiously as\r\nhe does, justifying his attitude with bits and pieces gleaned from the Bible, delivered in the most self-righteous manner imaginable. The result is\r\nperhaps the only Christmas movie I can think of, especially of the\r\nreligious-themed variety, that seems to flat-out endorse materialism, greed and\r\noutright gluttony. (Towards the end, Kirk admonishes one and all to \"get\r\nthe biggest ham...the richest butter.\") Advertisement Of\r\ncourse, it is all well and good for someone like myself to besmirch the film\r\nwith secularly-oriented sass but suppose you are someone whose views align\r\nperfectly with Cameron's\u2014would you find \"Saving Christmas\" to be a\r\nrewarding cinematic experience? My guess is probably not because this is a film\r\nthat has been presented in such a cheesy manner that it is barely a step up\r\nfrom a home movie shot during last year's festivities at Casa Cameron (and\r\nconsidering the number of Camerons and Doanes in the credits, that may not be\r\nthat far from the truth). Essentially, what one is getting for their\r\nhard-earned ticket money is roughly an hour of two guys sitting in a car in a\r\ndriveway talking, very occasionally interspersed with brief storytelling\r\nasides that boast the production values of your average junior high pageant.\r\nThen, after realizing that 60 minutes does not cut it as a feature-length film\r\nany more, Doane and Cameron stretch things out to a still-anemic 80 minutes\r\nwith such filler as two prologues, an endless final cookie following the\r\nequally endless end credits and an extended dance number set to a hip-hop\r\nrendition of \"Angels We Have Heard On High\" that may be the single whitest\r\nthing ever seen in a movie since Jill Clayburgh sang \"Maybe I'm\r\nAmazed\" in \"An Unmarried Woman.\"\u00a0\r\n(To be fair, I had hoped to ask some of the other attendees at the\r\npublic screening I attended what they thought of it to see if they were\r\nsatisfied with the slapdash proceedings, but, alas, I was the only person there.) Doing\r\nnothing but preaching to the converted\u2014literally and badly to\r\nboot\u2014\"Saving Christmas\" is a terrible movie regardless of one's\r\neschatological mindset. And while it may not be the worst Christmas-related\r\nmovie ever (a title I believe is still held by the vile \"Christmas with\r\nthe Kranks\"), it certainly does the genre no favors. However, if watching\r\nshoddily filmed presentations of shoddily constructed arguments justifying a\r\nself-absorbed perspective is the kind of thing that strikes your fancy, then it\r\nmay indeed be up your alley after all. Those who are not of that mindset would\r\nbe better served donating the price of a ticket to a food bank or shelter, where\r\nthe money could do some real good during the season. You will be glad that you did."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Silk", "Review": "\"Silk\" is a languid, too languid, story of romantic regrets, mostly ours, because romance is expected to carry the film without explaining it. It is told as a mournful flashback, narrated by a man who has been in love with two women, or maybe it was one all the time. He is a young Frenchman as his story begins circa 1860, who falls in love with a local girl, marries her and then is sent to Japan and falls in love again. The Frenchman is named Herve, played by Michael Pitt as the passive, soft-spoken plaything of every circumstance he falls into. Advertisement His complaint seems to be that his life has happened to him. His wife is Helene (Keira Knightley), who he truly loves, and who truly loves him, but cannot give him a child, although this plays less like a tragedy than just one of those things. His father is a rich businessman, perhaps the mayor, who takes the counsel of an entrepreneur named Baldabiou (Alfred Molina) that they revive the local silk mills. All goes well until disease attacks the silkworms. Then Baldabiou decides to send Herve to Japan to obtain uncontaminated silkworm eggs. This journey, by carriage, train, ship, caravan and horseback, takes him to a small Japanese village where the fearsome man in charge (Koji Yakusho) sizes him up, agrees to sell him eggs and introduces him, in a way, to his beautiful mistress (Sei Ashina). Their eyes meet, and something happens between them, or Herve is sure it does. He returns to France and his wife, with the eggs, which make them all rich. But he is obsessed by thoughts of the woman, and that inspires two more trips to Japan, and certain undercurrents in his marriage to the wife he still loves. There are some mysteries in the storytelling, a central one being the night he is told by a Dutch trader that the mistress \"is not what she seems.\" How so? \"She is not Japanese.\" Then what is she? The Internet Movie Database has no doubts, reporting that she is \"European,\" which she is certainly not. My guess is Korean or Chinese, but since he question remains unanswered, one wonders why it was introduced. Another mystery is how long silkworm eggs can survive during a journey back to France, since their fortunes seem to have no relationship to the nature of the journeys. But never mind. Herve's problem is when he's not with the one he loves, he loves the one he's with and is sincere about that at all times. Advertisement Our problem, on the other hand, is that we don't care. Michael Pitt almost whispers his way through the film, reveals not passion but damp-eyed self-pity and (given the language barrier) has no reason to be in love with the Japanese woman, except for the movie's blatant exoticism, which argues: Why would you be satisfied with a high-spirited, beautiful wife like Helene, who shares jolly tumbles in the sack, when you could have a Japanese woman who kneels submissively before you, takes forever to serve you tea, looks soulfully into your eyes, speaks not a word and touches you only once (although we know that, not Herve, who is blindfolded at the time). There are additional unforgivable plot elements which I dare not reveal, meant to be much more stirring than, under the circumstances, they can possibly be. And a piano score that weeps under many a scene. And a lot of beautiful photography. And then everything is brought together at the end in a flash of revelation that is spectacularly underwhelming."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Snitch", "Review": "Who would have guessed Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson would deliver the best work of his career playing a guy who squares off against a pack of small-time street thugs \u2014 and winds up face down on the ground, his mug bloodied and his wallet gone. You know, the kind of thing that would happen in real life when it's four against one, even if that one is an imposing hulk who looks like he's wearing a padded superhero suit under his shirt and jacket. For at least the first half of \u201cSnitch,\u201d I kept waiting for the Big Reveal to inform us that Johnson's law-abiding, self-made trucker businessman character John Matthews was once a deadly one-man wrecking crew CIA operative who went rogue. Or perhaps he was a reformed assassin now trying to live the quiet life with his beautiful second wife (Nadine Velazquez, the flight attendant in \u201cFlight\u201d). Maybe that happens and maybe it doesn't, \u201cSnitch\u201d keeps you off-balance and guessing throughout its thoroughly involving if occasional jaw-droppingly implausible developments. Advertisement Directed with impressive action style and a surprisingly gifted touch for family emotions by longtime stuntman Ric Roman Waugh, \u201cSnitch\u201d relies on the well-worn cliche of the mildly rebellious teenage son who still resents his dad for leaving him and his mom for a younger wife and a new family. Rafi Gavron does nice work as John's son, Jason, who foolishly accepts an overnight delivery of a big bag of ecstasy from his idiot friend and quickly finds himself locked in federal prison, facing a minimum of 10 years and seemingly daily beatings and abuse from hard-core inmates. This is when \u201cSnitch\u201d asks us to take our first and longest leap of faith. When John tells the ambitious U.S. attorney (who of course is running for U.S. Congress) Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) he'll do anything to spare his son, she tells him there's only one way \u2014 if John can land a bigger fish, she'll drastically reduce or even commute his son's sentence. This premise is based on fact: If you're busted on a felony drug charge, there are instances where you can bargain your way to a reduced sentence or freedom if you turn snitch and help land a major player in a cartel. But believability is stretched to the breaking point as John gets in deeper and deeper, planning and executing operations that would test Donnie Brasco's mettle and experience. And why does every drug dealer from a local Missouri thug (Michael K. Williams, Chalky on \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d) to a legendary cartel operative known as El Topo (\u201cThe Mole,\u201d played by Benjamin Bratt) seem so quick to accept John's help? Sure, he's got convenient access to big rigs, perfect for hauling and hiding drugs, but could it be that hard to buy some trucks if you're rolling in blow dough? What makes \u201cSnitch\u201d relatively effective is the lack of action solutions to every problem. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of shootouts and car chases, but despite the insanely large build that never draws a comment from a single character, John is almost always the least intimidating and lethal character in any given scene. (Except maybe \u2014 maybe \u2014 when Matthews is dealing with his wife, who is NOT thrilled to learn he hasn't been spending his nights working late at the office.) Everyone is excellent, notably Barry Pepper as a DEA agent with unfortunate facial hair and loyalties we sometimes question, and Jon Bernthal (late of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) as a two-time convict who gets duped by John into becoming his partner. In a mostly non-physical part that could have been played by anyone from Edward Norton to Anthony Mackie to Liev Schreiber, Johnson doesn't exactly cover the gamut of emotions flawlessly, but he's comfortable and natural onscreen. In scenes with Oscar winner Sarandon and Emmy winner Pepper, he's better than OK. To the very end, \u201cSnitch\u201d almost dares you to chuckle under your breath or at least ask some pointed questions. Even the resolution left me with one \u201cwait a minute!\u201d problem that seemed to have eluded every character in the film. Still, this movie executes two missions: A) to entertain us; and B) to put some big exclamation points on a couple of messages about certain drug laws in this country in need of a thorough re-examination.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", "Review": "The period spy thriller \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d is only\r\nintermittently engaging and amusing, and those portions of the movie that\r\nsucceed are also frustrating. Because they\u2019re cushioned by enervated,\r\nconceptually befuddled, and sometimes outright indifferent stuff.  Adapted from the genuine-article 1960s television series,\r\nwhich paired steely, no-nonsense, mid-Atlantic-accented veteran spy Napoleon\r\nSolo with younger slightly petulant Russian moptop Ilya Kuryakin,\r\nco-writer/director Guy Ritchie\u2019s film situates itself in an early Cold War\r\nwherein J.F.K. is still giving inspiring speeches. This movie\u2019s Solo (Henry\r\nCavill) struts his bespoke-suited self right into East Berlin to spirit out\r\nfeisty femme auto mechanic Gaby (Alicia Vikander), whose dad is an A-bomb\r\nexpert now working, apparently against his will with some neo-fascist Italian\r\nshipping magnates out to spread nuke terror. Solo\u2019s here working for the\r\nC.I.A.; hot on his trail is strong-jawed, Terminator-strong Kuryakin (Armie\r\nHammer). A chase ensues with all three parties ducking each other and Kuryakin\r\nactually ripping the trunk door off of one of the cars involved. Solo and Gaby\r\ncross the Berlin Wall by means of a sort of zipline; imagine Solo\u2019s surprise\r\nwhen he soon learns that for his next mission he has to collaborate with the\r\nKGB agent who almost had him for dinner.  Advertisement A gruff Agency honcho Jared Harris, approximating a Texan\r\naccent, delivers the news and he and his KGB counterpart debrief the unhappy\r\nnew partners at a crowded outdoor caf\u00e9. Why these guys are spilling\r\ninternational secrets in a setting where they can be effortlessly overheard is\r\nthe source for one of the movie\u2019s better visual gags. Alas, the movie doesn\u2019t\r\nhave too many more \u201cgotcha!\u201ds in its bag. The two spies soon touch down in\r\nItaly, where they flirt\u2014Ilya with Gaby, and Solo with one of the neo-fascists,\r\na blah femme fatale played by Elizabeth Debicki\u2014and do spy stuff. In this\r\nmovie\u2019s reimagining of the characters, Solo has a backstory as a master thief,\r\nwhile Ilya is a chess-obsessed strong man with rage and daddy issues. This\r\ngives Cavill and Hammer amusing bits to enact, but, and here\u2019s a big rub,\r\nwhatever it is that Cavill and Hammer are supposed to bring to this movie, they\r\ndon\u2019t. They fill out their clothes very nicely, it\u2019s true, but other than that\r\nthey are to charisma what black holes are to matter. \u201cFlat\u201d really doesn\u2019t begin\r\nto cover it.  Then there\u2019s the direction. Ritchie clearly wants to revel\r\nin a pre-swinging-\u201860s vibe, but he either can\u2019t or won\u2019t commit to it in a way\r\nthat yields any actual fun. Possibly he\u2019s wary of bumping up against \u201cAustin\r\nPowers\u201d-style pastiche, but whatever the cause, when he\u2019s not being incoherent,\r\nhe\u2019s being fussy. Even the soundtrack has a kind of stick up its fundament;\r\nit\u2019s chock full of the Right Names in early \u201860s international (and largely\r\nItalian) pop, but it\u2019s largely lacking in infectiousness. Seriously, they could\r\nhave thrown in a \u201cTake It East My Brother Charlie\u201d or something and only a jerk\r\nlike me would have pointed out the anachronism.  There are times when the movie uses its leads\u2019 lack of\r\naffect in service of a cheeky sense of humor, as in Solo\u2019s sojourn in the cab\r\nof a truck, after a frantic chase scene, sitting out (or so it seems) a\r\nnear-fatal brush with danger for partner Ilya. But much of the time Richie\r\nseems uninterested in the action, although a final chase featuring a jeep, a\r\nskeletal ATV, and a motorcycle unspools like a choose-your-own-adventure video\r\ngame, and I mean that in a good way. But the misfires are just as memorable, as\r\nwhen Richie and company use realistic evocations of Nazi atrocities to fill out\r\nthe character of one minor villain. And if you were lucky enough to have seen\r\nVikander in \u201cEx Machina\u201d (and if you haven\u2019t been you ought to change that),\r\nyou\u2019ll be profoundly appreciative of just how much she\u2019s wasted here. She\u2019s\r\nadorable anyway, however.  Advertisement While it can\u2019t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his\r\nreturn to prominence in the last half hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on\r\nearlier in the movie, peps things up considerably. Grant\u2019s character is the one\r\nthat pulls the whole \u201cU.N.C.L.E.\u201d concept together, birthing an agency in which\r\nKGB, C.I.A., and MI6 or 5 or whatever it is can cooperate to prevent mutual\r\nassured destruction or something like that. Kind of like that agency in that\r\nother summer spy thriller that this summer spy thriller is not going to present\r\nany serious competition to. In any event, an entire movie in which the\r\nweathered but still debonair Grant played the bluff, amiable puppetmaster to\r\nthe two hunky ciphers might have been great fun. I gather that Richie and\r\ncompany still want to make that movie. I have mixed feelings about whether they\r\nought to, or will."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "This is England", "Review": "A burning need is the first thing we see in Shaun's eyes. He needs a father, he needs to be taller and stronger, he needs to dress like the other kids dress, he needs to fit in somewhere. Shaun, played by Thomas Turgoose in one of those performances that seem more like self-discovery than an act of will, is 12 years old and lives at the shabby end of a town in Yorkshire, not far from the sea. It is July 1983, and his father has been killed in the Falklands War; he takes the death as a kind of betrayal. Advertisement There isn't much money in the family. His mother (Jo Hartley) throws up her hands when he complains about his lack of Doc Martens shoes, without which a boy his age might as well stay home. She sacrifices to buy him some lookalikes, and when he complains they're not the real thing, she says they're better: \"These are from London!\" All the same. Shaun is always getting beaten up and picked on, until one day he cuts through an underpass and meets a gang of skinheads led by Woody (Joe Gilgun). Woody is friendly. Cheers him up. Tells him he can come around again. Soon Shaun has a surrogate family and a new social group and a better self-image, especially when one of the gang girls shaves off his curly hair. His mother is horrified. She marches Shaun down to the cafe where the gang hangs out, wants to know who did this to her son and asks, \"Don't you think he's a little young to be hanging around with your lot?\" Then, curiously, she leaves Shaun in their care. You could spend a lot of time thinking about why she does that. Shane Meadows' \"This Is England\" focuses on a specific tipping point in the history of English skinheads. As we meet the gang, it is somewhat benign and not racist (Milky, played by Andrew Shim, is Afro-Caribbean). Shaun has, in a sense, a new family, and even gets his first kiss, from a goth girl who likes him. Then Combo (Stephen Graham) is released from prison, and with the lessons he learned there, teaches them violence, looting and racism. When the gang splits in two, Shaun makes the mistake of following Combo, maybe because he is more impressed by his strength than Woody's friendship. All of this takes place nearly 25 years ago in England, but it could take place today in any American city. Poverty, absent fathers and dangerous streets make gang membership seem like a safe haven, and soon Shaun is aping the bigger guys, swaggering around, disregarding his mother, getting in trouble. Meadows knows this world. The director of such films as \"Once Upon A Time In The Midlands\" (2003), a portrait of working-class life, he says he was a skinhead at about Shaun's age. Other films, like Alan Clarke's \"Made in Britain\" (1982), with its early Tim Roth performance, also show the strange attraction to violence that grows in such gangs: Do they hurt and get hurt out of hatred, alienation, fear, or a compulsion to fit into the gang? When two gangs fight, is that essentially a mutual initiation ceremony? In England, certainly at that time, handguns were not easy to own, so at least the body count was low. Guns and cars make accidental drive-by killings common in Chicago, where the gangs have it easy; when you're on foot, it's rare to murder a 6-year-old girl when you're really after her neighbor. Advertisement The movie is taut, tense, relentless. It shows why Shaun feels he needs to belong to a gang, what he gets out of it and how it goes wrong. Without saying so, it also explains why skinheads are skinheads: Any threatened group has a tendency to require its members to adopt various costumes, hair or presentation styles that mark them as members, so they can't deny it or escape it, and the group can exercise authority even at a distance. What happens at the end is part of history: Skinheads became allied with the neo-Nazi National Front. They became violent toward nonwhites and immigrants. It wasn't so much that they hated them, perhaps, as that they needed an enemy to validate themselves, because they felt as worthless as they said their opponents were. Whenever you see one group demonizing another group, what they charge the others with is often what they fear about themselves. For Shaun, this is more than he was looking for. Better to be lonely than to be deprived of the right to be alone."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Jersey Boys", "Review": "The last\r\nscene of \u201cJersey Boys\u201d is a curtain call of sorts. Set to The Four Seasons\u2019\r\nmemorable ode to deflowering, \u201cDecember, 1963,\u201d the scene explodes with bright,\r\nnoisy colors and jubilant voices. It hops from character to character, visually\r\nname-checking the entire cast as they sing and dance. The camerawork, editing\r\nand lighting foster a genuine sense of excitement. In this finale, \u201cJersey Boys\u201d\r\nfeels like the Broadway musical upon which it is based, showcasing the energy\r\nand joy that continues to leap off the stage every night in venues from Las Vegas\r\nto London.  Advertisement If only director\r\nClint Eastwood had directed more scenes like this. He ensured his\r\ncast would be up to the task by importing several veterans from the stage.\r\nThree of the Four Seasons cast in \u201cJersey Boys\u201d are from various incarnations\r\nof the show, including Tony-winner John Lloyd Young, whose Frankie Valli is\r\nvocally spot-on and a force to behold. Christopher Walken, no slouch to\r\nmusicals, is also on hand, doing a bit of a soft-shoe in the aforementioned\r\nfinale. Even \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d vet Vincent Piazza, as group member Tommy\r\nDeVito, holds his own with the more musically seasoned members of The Four Seasons.\r\n The singing talent\r\nis there, but Eastwood and writers Marshall Brickman (\u201cAnnie Hall\u201d) and Rick\r\nElise opt for a more realistic depiction of events. They transform \u201cJersey Boys\u201d\r\nfrom jukebox musical to movie biopic, exchanging one much-maligned genre for\r\nanother. In the process, the focus is shifted; the drama is played up and the\r\nmusic seems shoehorned in where convenient.  This\r\nimbalance is forgivable in scenes where the band deals with talent scout Joe\r\nPesci (yes, that Joe Pesci, here in the guise of actor Joey Russo) or interact\r\nwith one another. The problems arise in the mob-related material, which is\r\nseemingly endless. These plot elements are necessary to tell the full story,\r\nbut the lazy way they are depicted stops the movie cold. We've already seen \u201cGoodFellas,\u201d\r\n\u201cMean Streets\u201d and any number of mob-related tales, so Eastwood\u2019s take on them\r\nfeels lifeless. As the catalyst for most of these scenes, Piazza wrings his\r\nderivative character for all that he\u2019s worth. But Walken, as mob boss Gyp\r\nDeCarlo, is given little to do besides commit scene-stealing grand larceny in a\r\nweepy moment opposite Young\u2019s Valli. \u201cJersey Boys\u201d keeps the show\u2019s conceit of\r\nhaving each of the Four Seasons tell various aspects of the story. Tommy, Frankie,\r\nNick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) break the fourth\r\nwall at various points to talk to us directly. Since Tommy is both the band\u2019s\r\nheart and its downfall, he figures into everyone\u2019s narrative. Songwriter Gaudio\r\nbecomes the band\u2019s primary songwriter because Tommy acted on a tip from Joe\r\nPesci. Frankie sharpens and perfects his famous falsetto with Tommy\u2019s help. And\r\nNick rooms with Tommy for 10 years and sees the worst sides of him.  Advertisement Whether they\u2019re\r\nsinging or fighting, \u201cJersey Boys\u201d is at its best when it focuses on the band\r\nmembers\u2019 chemistry. The actors know their characters\u2019 voices well enough to\r\neffortlessly plow through as many Four Seasons songs as the original musical\r\ncontains. They sound spectacular, and there\u2019s enough of each song to satiate\r\nfans and newbies alike. But Eastwood shoots so many of these numbers in a\r\nmatter-of-fact, almost documentary style, static way that the two times he\r\nreally cuts loose are the film\u2019s best moments. The second time is the curtain\r\ncall finale; the first is Young\u2019s hauntingly emotional rendering of \u201cCan\u2019t Take\r\nMy Eyes Off You.\u201d If you know the song, you\u2019ll know what the big mid-number reveal\r\nis. Eastwood presents it with stunning gusto, and the reaction Valli gets at\r\nthe end is as close to a stand-up-and-cheer moment as \u201cJersey Boys\u201d gets.  Though no\r\nlonger playing to the back of the house, Young, Bergen and Lomenda still have a\r\ntendency to go big in front of the camera. It\u2019s most noticeable opposite Piazza\u2019s\r\nTommy, who despite his stereotype-ridden role gives the best performance in \u201cJersey\r\nBoys.\u201d Yet the vocal talent trumps any minor performance issues incurred. The\r\nfilmmakers made the right decisions for the leads. This movie will sell many\r\nsoundtracks. The elephant\r\nin the room is Eastwood himself. He is the wrong director for this \r\nmaterial,\r\nand this opinion comes from someone who loved \u201cMillion Dollar Baby,\u201d \r\n\u201cSpace\r\nCowboys\u201d and even those orangutan movies. He is the wrong choice, but \r\nnot for\r\nthe reason you think. Eastwood is adept at handling music in films, from\r\n \u201cBird\u201d\r\nto his country music homage to Garbo\u2019s \u201cCamille,\u201d \u201cHonkytonk Man\u201d (which\r\n I also\r\nlike without shame). But, for once, I have to agree with those who say \r\nhis style is too laid\r\nback. A movie as grungy, profane and blue-collar as \u201cJersey Boys\u201d needs to feel more alive. When the music\u2019s \r\nnot\r\nplaying, \u201cJersey Boys\u201d starts to lull you into mild lethargy. I wonder \r\nwhat\r\nfellow Jersey Boy Brian De Palma could have done with this."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Big Men", "Review": "If you want to see the ugly side of capitalism, one place you are sure to get a glimpse is anywhere established First World economies interact with Third World economies. That's where the drive for profit above all else is unhindered by a fully developed system of laws and regulations. In \"Big Men\", Rachel Boynton offers a case study in how the promise of big wealth brings out the ruthless self-interest of all the parties concerned. Along the way, she raises larger questions that lift this doc above being a simple lecture on how greed is bad and big oil is evil, making it into something with more heft. Advertisement The doc follows the key players in the massive Jubilee oil field discovered off the coast of Ghana. Jim Musselman, the president of Kosmos Energy, is a strapping Texan with ranching in his blood who turned to oil exploration. As the doc begins, in 2007, his company has made the discovery of a lifetime. The Jubilee field promises to make someone very, very rich. The question is who will reap the benefits. Will it be Musselman and his tiny company, which takes high risks in oil exploration in hopes of a big return like Jubilee? Will it be George Owusu, the local agent hired to promote Kosmos' interests in Ghana? Will it be the government of Ghana? Will it be the already rich and powerful of Ghana, skimming off the profits for themselves? Or will Ghana, seeing the example of how oil has ruined nearby Nigeria, follow a more enlightened path and find ways to raise the quality of life of the poor of Ghana? And what will happen when the oil boom, in high gear in 2007, hits the economic meltdown? As the film began, I will admit I thought I knew pretty much where Boynton was heading: Big oil bad, corrupt government bad, profit-sharing with the poor good but unlikely. And that's certainly the general trajectory here. The rich find new and novel ways to screw over the poor, but also each other. It's rather dazzling when the Kosmos Board of Directors lose faith in Musselman and fire him, and he gets a bit more blunt and honest on camera about how everyone involved is ready to throw anyone under the bus to increase their share. Of course, the delicious irony is that Musselman is saying all this just minutes after we've seen him throw George Owusu, the Ghanian agent, under the bus in an international investigation of corrupt business practices.  And frankly, Boynton's inclusion of substantial footage of Nigeria feels like a move necessary to the civics lesson rather than a natural outgrowth of the story she is telling. Yes, Nigeria offers a cautionary tale about how badly managed oil development and a corrupt government can lead to increased poverty and a social and ecological disaster. But it also feels a bit forced, as if Boynton is setting the poor desperate rebels of Nigeria into a didactic opposition to the Big Oil players she has been following. Advertisement The surprise of the film is twofold. First, Boynton doesn't make anyone into a cartoon villain. There are a few unsubtle moments, like showing a close-up of a Ghanian government official's gold-ring-bedecked hands while asking him about corruption. But on the whole, she allows Musselman, Owusu and others to emerge as real, complicated people. Musselman can wax philosophical about being kicked out of his own company and see exactly the moves on the international chess board that made him the inevitable fall guy for the investors, and muse on the new Ghanian administration that wants a bigger piece of the pie: \"They're just as corrupt as can be.\" That's pretty thick irony considering the people Musselman's company has been doing business with in the previous administration. (Of course, he can be so calm about it in part because he still owns Kosmos stock that makes him rich regardless of his job title\u2026). The second and more interesting twist is how Boynton raises the bigger questions. In interview after interview, we hear people ponder how self interest relates to the greater good. Is brutal self interest at the expense of others an inherent part of human nature? Is there a way to harness self interest for the greater good? What makes people act against their own self interest? As the documentary closes, the rich have gotten richer and the fate of the poor of Ghana remains an unanswered question. But it's those bigger questions about our nature and our capacity to think beyond self interest that will stick with you."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Gun Shy", "Review": "\u201cGun Shy\u201d is an action-comedy starring Antonio Banderas that is lacking only action, comedy and a performance by Antonio Banderas that is anything other than a complete embarrassment. At least with a good number of bad movies, you can sometimes see what they were attempting to go for and then analyze where and how they went wrong. In the case of this film, not only does it not work by even the most basic of entertainment standards, it is impossible to grasp what the result might have been like if it had actually worked, unless it was meant to be a part of an experiment designed to make 92 minutes seem as if they are lasting forever.  Advertisement Banderas plays Turk Landry, the one-time bass player for the popular heavy metal band Metal Assassin (whose big hit is the deathless classic \u201cTeenage Ass Patrol\u201d). He left the group years earlier to marry his supermodel girlfriend, Sheila (Olga Kurylenko). Now living in near-seclusion in Malibu, the dissolute Turk spends his days doing little more than guzzling beer\u2014he doesn\u2019t make music, he barely notices Sheila, and when a news report comes on making fun of him and referring to Sheila as Metal Assassins\u2019s \u201cYoko\u201d (presumably because she is also a smart businesswoman and a talented artist), he is so lazy that he has to bring in a couple of guys to hurl the TV into the swimming pool. Although Sheila does manage to spur him into getting off the couch to accompany her on a vacation to his birthplace of Chile (though he tries to pretend he is really from England even while retaining his normal accent), she cannot get him to go along with her on a sightseeing tour. Her group is subsequently kidnapped by pirates and when they realize who she is married to, they demand a million-dollar ransom for her return. It soon becomes apparent that Sheila is in no real danger\u2014her kidnappers admit that they have only been pirates for about nine hours and she finds herself educating them on such things as basic seamanship. For Turk, however, things are somewhat more complicated on his end. He has the million and is more than willing to relinquish it in exchange for Sheila, but first he is unable to get a hold of his manager to send the cash, only low-level employee Marybeth (Aisling Loftus). She gets him the money, but by this time, an ambitious U.S. government stooge (Mark Valley) gets wind of the kidnapping and tries to use the situation as a step towards career advancement by promoting it to his superiors as an act of terrorism and refusing to allow Turk to make the ransom payment by claiming that doing so would violate the Patriot Act. Much wackiness ensues as a vaguely resurgent Turk, along with Marybeth and a randy hostage recovery expert (Jesse Johnson) try to figure out how to get to Sheila and the pirates to make the trade while the government goon goes to increasingly desperate and violent lengths to prevent that from happening. Bearing all the hallmarks of a screenplay that has been justifiably sitting on a shelf for a long, long time before inexplicably being dusted off and put before the cameras\u2014it feels like a substandard action comedy from the early 1990s with jokes about Amazon and Facebook awkwardly stuck in at random to make it seem slightly fresher\u2014\u201cGun Shy\u201d somehow manages to come across as being both screechingly over-the-top and desperately, painfully dull at the same time. The script by Toby Davies and Mark Haskell Smith is absolutely awful\u2014even by dumb action comedy standards. The story is a mess, the jokes are ghastly, and the characters are pretty much slackwits and dullards across the board. Director Simon West is all thumbs here as well. The comedy scenes are not funny, the action scenes are not exciting and the one big attempt to blend the two, an extended fight sequence in which numerous innocent people are tased and a guy with a shellfish allergy repeatedly has shrimp rubbed in his face and eyes, is as ugly of a would-be set-piece that you will see this year. Advertisement Considering that \u201cGun Shy\u201d is a film that must have seemed without promise or hope even in the screenplay stage, you have to wonder what could have possibly induced Banderas to sign on to appear in it. My guess is that he saw the first couple of pages, read that he was going to be playing a gone-to-seed rock star and agreed to do it right then, before reading the rest and finding out that he would be spending the majority of the film sitting around and doing virtually nothing while wearing a goofy-looking wig and wouldn\u2019t get to get in touch with his inner rocker until a musical number during the end credits that give the proceedings the only shot of discernible energy. (For a film that has little story to speak of, it has so many different scenes taking place during and after the end credits that they should rename it \u201cMarvel's Gun Shy.\u201d) Until then, he just spends his screen time acting like an idiot while looking mortified at the inanities he has been asked to enact."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Bad Teacher", "Review": "\"Bad Teacher\" immediately brings \"Bad Santa\" to mind and suffers by the comparison. Its bad person is neither bad enough or likable enough. The transgressions of Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) are more or less what you'd expect, but what's surprising is that she's so nasty and unpleasant. Billy Bob Thornton, as the Bad Santa, was more outrageously offensive and yet more redeemed by his desperation. He was bad for urgent reasons. Elizabeth seems bad merely as a greedy lifestyle choice. As the film opens, Miss Halsey is engaged to a rich guy she leeches on but doesn't love. She's dumped and has to return to teaching, an occupation she had no talent for or interest in; she passes the time showing DVDs to her students while she naps, drinks and does drugs at her desk. This creates astonishment and indignation in the charmingly named Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), whose classroom is right across the hall. Advertisement The school characters also include new teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), amiable but juiceless; veteran teacher Ms. Pavicic (Jillian Armenante), a sweet dumpling; the hunky gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel), and the dolphin-obsessed Principal Wally Snur (John Michael Higgins).  Of these characters, the rival played by Lucy Punch is the most colorful, because she's the most driven and obsessed. The others seem curiously inconsequential, content to materialize in a scene, perform a necessary function and vaporize. There's no urgency, and that was the one quality \"Bad Santa\" dripped with. None of the film's major characters is a student, which seems odd. Yes, there's a kid who writes bad poetry and has a crush on the class sexpot, but his desperation seems well within comic bounds. There are no vindictive students, none with aggressive behavior, no little \"Omens\" in training. The casting of the students seems lacking in imagination, but then what does the screenplay give them to do? Cameron Diaz has proved that she is gifted with comedy. But here, her Elizabeth is a mean, antagonistic money grubber on autopilot. Where did she come from? Why did she get into teaching in the first place? Has she no heart? There are times in \"Bad Santa\" when we feel sorry for the poor SOB, but nothing in \"Bad Teacher\" inspires more than distaste for its lead character. Other problems: There is no chemistry, or indeed even much mutual awareness between Diaz and Timberlake. You know those annual Bad Sex Awards for the worst sex scene in a movie? Their dry-humping scene deserves an award for the decade. The scene itself is pathetic. The shot it ends on \u2014 the wet spot on Timberlake's blue jeans \u2014 had the preview audience recoiling.\rWhole chunks of the plot seem to have gone missing. Were drug charges ever filed against Miss Squirrel (in an attemped frame by Miss Halsey)? And how, oh, how, can we possibly understand the eventual development between Elizabeth and Russell the gym teacher? You know what that feels like? It feels like they called Diaz and Jason Segal in for one additional day of shooting to provide a preposterous happy ending. Jolly music keeps elbowing its way onto the soundtrack in an unconvincing attempt to cue us that we've seen a good comedy. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", "Review": "Haunted house movies awaken within us the 5-year-old afraid to go down the stairs with the basement lights off. Sure, there's a light switch down at the bottom, but you never know. \"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\" begins with an extraordinary house that should be haunted, even if it isn't. This is a mansion in Australia, I learn, much enhanced by art direction and set design, which I might be reluctant to occupy alone even with all the lights on. Into this house move a 10-year-old girl named Sally, her father and her father's girlfriend. The movie depends so much on the little girl, played by Bailee Madison with pluck, intelligence and a righteous temper. When children are endangered in horror movies, it's no fun if they just scream and run away. That's taking a cheap shot. Sally is brave and determined, and Madison is an effective young actress.  Advertisement Her father, Alex (Guy Pearce), loves her in a perfunctory and distant way. The girlfriend, Kim (Katie Holmes), is warmer and more sympathetic, because it's always the men who are dolts in these matters. They hope she'll like living at Blackwood Manor, which her father has purchased. The plan is, they'll renovate it and sell it at enough of a profit to put Alex's business back on its feet. I guess they bought it at a bargain price. The film begins with a creepy introduction in which crabby old Emerson Blackwood and his son come to terrifying ends years ago. Perhaps it has been empty ever since? My rule of thumb is, think twice about moving into any abandoned manor named Blackwood that has a history of mysterious deaths. Trust me on this. The film is based on a made-for-TV thriller from 1973, which starred young Kim Darby as Sally. Seeing that film reportedly so transfixed young Guillermo del Toro that at the age of 9, he determined to dedicate his life to making fantastical horror films, and has. Indeed, the use of a heroine and grotesque creatures is the hallmark of his great \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (2006). He co-wrote the screenplay and produced this film. This is only the second film by the director, Troy Nixey, but he shows a firm hold on atmosphere. He and the screenplay make good use of the inclination of adults to dismiss the fears of children as imagination running wild. The tension between what we know Sally has experienced, and the casual dismissals of the grown-ups is central to much of the film's tension. The little girl explains over and over again what she has seen. She draws pictures. There is ominous agreement from old Harris (Jack Thompson), the house's caretaker. Ever notice how houses named Blackwood Manor always have grizzled caretakers lurking about? There is even a local librarian who turns out to be quite an expert on old Emerson Blackwood. Alex doesn't want to know about it. He's in a financial corner, he has all his money tied up in the manor, and he doesn't fancy bankruptcy just on the basis of childish terrors. Kim is torn. She's looking forward to marriage. She loves Sally. They both have an annoying tendency to allow the child to wander the manor alone.  Advertisement It is an added element that the horrors mostly seem to reside in the basement. This isn't the sort of basement the word usually summons, but a lower living area, long since blocked off, with a fireplace flue behind which \u2026 something lives. This makes perfect sense to me. When I was a little boy a green worm with teeth lived inside the drain of our bathroom sink. Nixey provides us with a very gradual introduction to the inhabitants of the flue, which opens over a dark, deep space. Into this space we earlier saw Emerson Blackwood fall. Or was he pulled? Exploring the area, Sally innocently checks out the grating, and we hear ominous whispers and rustlings, and glimpse the body parts of\u2026 something.  These creatures are eventually seen more clearly, which I must say is a disappointment. The mastery of CGI allow filmmakers to show just about anything they can imagine, when sometimes it's scarier to show nothing at all. Consider the timeless \"Cat People\" (1942). We never saw a thing. But when the heroine goes alone for a late-night plunge in a swimming pool, she hears something growl, and pace, and nothing we could possible see could improve on that scene. I'll let you discover what these little creatures look like. Perhaps, like me, you'll wonder about their metabolism. There are a great many of them, apparently thriving for decades down there at the bottom with the old fireplace ashes. They're very agile and energetic, and scamper around and snarl and brandish things, and they demand to be fed the teeth of children. You wonder how long life can be sustained on an all-teeth diet. Now that Bill Clinton is a vegan, let him try that for a while. But I stray. This is a very good haunted house film. It milks our frustration deliciously. The adults are forever saying and doing the wrong things, and making stupid decisions, and Alex is bullheaded, and Kim is conflicted. And the shadows are deep and dark, and the screws in the grating of the flue seem to turn themselves, and no one will pay attention to little Sally, and somewhere in the audience will be a kid who gets inspired to make his own horror films."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Centurion", "Review": "The Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu once made a film called \"The Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice.\" \"Centurion\" might be thought of as \"The Color of Red Guts Over Mountains,\" because that, as much as anything, describes what it is about.  The story is stripped down to an epic, feature-length chase. Stranded behind enemy lines, a small band of Roman soldiers are hunted by a tribe of Celtic Picts through the forbidding Highland scenery of ancient Scotland. They run and run and jump and climb and eat a kind of prototypical free-range haggis from the belly of a freshly killed stag, then run and run \u2014 monotonously \u2014 some more.  Advertisement Most of the characters are so characterless that you can't tell who they are when they get impaled or beheaded, and you can't remember who they used to be after they're dispatched. Not that it matters. This leaves plenty of time for staring at spectacularly craggy landscapes in white, gray, blue and green, relieved by lovely splashes of bright red during the fighting and torture scenes, of which there are too few. Perhaps you're not used to thinking of imploding and exploding brain matter, flayed torsos and severed limbs in terms of abstract aesthetic beauty. Well, think again. Writer-director Neil Marshall (whose \"The Descent\" is one of the finest, most harrowing horror films of the new century) shoots his head-to-head (or axe-to-head) combat violence in jittery Strobo-Vision, a technique that paradoxically makes the explicit carnage look less realistic and more like cartoony \"Evil Dead\" splatter. The eruptions of red serve as welcome compositional elements, providing the only vibrant color from the warm part of the spectrum. Never mind who's getting slaughtered, that red is gore-geous.  The film starts with a long, CGI-assisted helicopter shot through the opening credits that takes us deep into the remote mountainous reaches of the Roman Empire in Northern Britain, where we encounter centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender, of \"Hunger\"), a scarlet slash across his bare chest, fleeing unseen predators and tumbling through the snowfields. As narrator, he introduces himself and tells us that \"this is neither the beginning nor the end of my story.\" Sure enough, 15 minutes later, we've circled back to this same moment in the narrative, and the movie isn't yet over by a long shot. What happens before and (mostly) after this is that the Ninth Legion, under the command of lusty Gen. Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West, immortal as McNulty on \"The Wire\"), is sent on a mission that goes disastrously wrong when the imperial forces are beset by Pictish fireballs. For the rest of the film, the aforementioned bedraggled handful of Roman survivors are stalked over mountain and dale by a murderous band of dogged Picts, which becomes the occasion for some jokey \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" references about cliffs and posses. Also featured is a feral mute she-wolf huntress named Etain (\"Quantum of Solace\" Bond girl Olga Kurylenko), whose tracking savvy is surpassed only by her fierce appetite for turning Romans into rag\u00f9.  Advertisement \"Centurion\" is a sort of A.D. 117 platoon movie, photographed principally in long shots (aerial shots, crane shots, distant tracking shots, creeping-up-over-ridges shots, stately establishing shots with views that go on for miles), so that the characters are reduced to tiny, faceless figures scrabbling across the wide-screen landscape until they disappear into it. For close-up contrast, there's the obligatory idyll at the forest hut of the enchantress Arianne (Imogen Poots), a beautiful, ostracized Pict witch who hides the men from their pursuers, feeds them and nurses (or bewitches) the wounded back to health. You've seen this scene so many times before in these kinds of movies that you know exactly what happens, and it does, but even when we get near enough to the characters to recognize their physiognomy, they remain dramatically featureless.  Like all war movies (indeed, practically all movies) in the last seven years, \"Centurion\" also features deliberate references to more recent guerilla insurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan, which aren't really subtle enough to be called subtext. They're text, taken straight from modern newsbites. As in: \"This is a new kind of war, a war without honor, war without end.\" Or the away-from-home soldier's eternal complaint: \"This place is the a--hole of the world.\" It will not come as a surprise to learn that \"Centurion\" has been rated R by the MPAA, but that's for language as well as violence. The Roman soldiers drop f-bombs and s-bombs hither and yon across the Cairngorms, reminding us of the piquant Latin and Celtic origins of the English language as it is spoken to this very day."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Trollhunter", "Review": "It is a misery to be a troll. You haunt the forests of Norway, live in clammy caves and inhabit bodies incapable of processing vitamin D, so that the sun can cause you to crumble into stone. Your obsession is hunting Christians, but because you live in a Norwegian wilderness far from cities, there are few Christians to be found \u2014 and since some trolls are taller than trees, they can see you coming. \"Trollhunter\" is a mockumentary allegedly edited from anonymous footage and certainly inspired by \"The Blair Witch Project.\" It has something going for it: We see a lot of trolls and we saw precious few witches. At first, the filmmakers aren't even looking for trolls; three young students are on the track of a man suspected of poaching bears. We meet Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud); his sound person, Johanna (Johanna Morck), and the cinematographer (Tomas Alf Larsen), none of whom, of course, is especially competent because a requirement of the genre is a lot of Queasy-Cam. Advertisement They're on the trail of a suspect, Hans (Otto Jespersen), who prowls the forest trails in a Land Rover with alarming scratches on its doors. Eventually Hans allows them to trail along, and they discover that the Norwegian government employs troll hunters in a secret program to stop the beasts, who are a threat to power pylons, the environment, and of course Christians. They sniff out Christians by their distinctive smell. That leads to some droll scenes in which Hans leads them in smearing their bodies with troll stench. That's funny. A lot of \"Trollhunter\" \u2014 but not enough \u2014 is funny. I imagine the best way to see the movie would be the way it was presented at Sundance, at a \"secret\" midnight screening at which the capacity audience allegedly has no idea what it is about to see. Trolls are very ugly, except to other trolls. There are various sorts, including mountain trolls and forest trolls. The shortage of Christians in their locales perhaps explains their ill humor. They spend a great deal of time roaring, bleating, squealing and snorting at a very high volume, which is, after a point, too much of a muchness. The fake-doc look nicely explains the partial glimpses and incomplete shots during the troll hunt, although we get a nice look at some of the beasts, who have amazingly ugly schnozzolas. There is a scene that seems like a loving tribute to monster movies since time immemorial, in which threatened humans huddle in a cave, and monsters can be seen sniffling at the cave's mouth. This solves the problem of incorporating effects (and miniatures?) into the shot.  At one point, it's explained that trolls cannot be seen in satellite photos. That must be because of their coloration and not their size, because one in particular seems to stand 50 feet tall, easy. Why did I waste time thinking about satellite photos, however, when I was presented with a more pressing problem: If trolls can't stand sunlight, which creates vitamin D and helps with bone calcium, why do they possess so much calcium that a leading cause of death is instant calcification, which is not a pretty sight? Unfortunately, the film ends abruptly before the troll hunters can explain that. Of course it's a requirement of the genre that all the children of \"Blair Witch\" end abruptly. But I digress.

{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Life on the Line", "Review": "At the end of this movie, before the closing credits, a few screens\u2019 worth of text informs the viewer of the casualty rate of the electrical lineman over the past few years, and gives the name of a website whose mission \u201cis to memorialize fallen electrical line workers, and care for the families who have lost or are impacted by a severe injury of a loved one in the line of duty. We strive to consolidate accident and injury information to share openly for a safer work environment.\u201d Its web address is http://fallenlinemen.org and the site is well worth visiting. Advertisement I point this out now because I am obliged to assess the movie that preceded it. That movie does not, I think, do the job it intended, which was, I think, to make the lineman's work accessible to the viewer and to honor the courage and sacrifice of those who labor to keep the nation\u2019s electrical grid safe and operative. This is one of those \u201cbased on true events\u201d movies that give you the distinct feeling that the true events deserved better.  After introducing the framing device of an interview with a lineman played by Devon Sawa, the movie begins again with a prologue set in 1998 Texas, with John Travolta, in unconvincing young-age makeup, as Beau Ginner, a Texas lineman working in the middle of a lightning storm. He fails to rig some wires properly; his coworker, who\u2019s also his brother, chastises him, goes up the pole, and is soon killed after lightning hits a wire. His sister-in-law is killed in an auto accident rushing to the scene. Ginner is left with his memories, his job, and his young niece Bailey, who grows up to be played by Kate Bosworth, who also played the sister-in-law.  Experience has made Beau a safety maven, and sentiment has made Bailey a \u2018round the way girl who has the potential to go to college (one would think so, at age 33, although I guess Bosworth\u2019s playing younger) but prefers to work in a diner and be a townie\u2014which means being part of the lineman extended family. Here is where the narrative complications come in, and boy is director David Hackl not up for them. Here we go: Bailey has a sort-of ex-boyfriend named Duncan (that\u2019s Devon Sawa\u2019s character) who\u2019s a bit of a bad boy, motorcycle and all. (He\u2019s also got an alcoholic mom, a lineman widow, played by Sharon Stone in dampened \u201cCasino\u201d mode.) He\u2019s decided to straighten out, so he gets a job working the line, much to the chagrin of Beau. Then there\u2019s Ron (Matt Bellefleur), a creepy ex of Bailey\u2019s who\u2019s hanging around all sorts of places where he isn\u2019t welcome. Beau and Bailey also have new across-the-street neighbors, Ryan Robbins\u2019 Eugene, a lineman who\u2019s also an Iraq war veteran with PTSD, and his wife Carline (Julie Benz), who\u2019s good-hearted and loyal up to a point, and who picks the wrong way to balk at Eugene\u2019s neglect and borderline abuse. As a major storm approaches their town\u2014you know this because every other scene or so a title comes up saying \u201c[X] Days Before THE STORM,\u201d with graphics like some cable news special or something\u2014the characters abrade each other in various ways, Bailey reveals a secret, and something\u2019s gotta give. In case you missed it, it\u2019s pretty clear that the storm is gonna make everything and more do that giving. These plot lines aren\u2019t simple, but they\u2019re not exactly convoluted either. Frequently while watching \u201cLife on the Line\u201d I thought how much better they\u2019d be handled\u2014straight and clean and without fuss\u2014in a 1930s or 40s working-man\u2019s melodrama from Warner Brothers, maybe one by a director along the lines of Raoul Walsh. He made one of the great men-in-a-dangerous-profession pictures, 1940\u2019s \u201cThey Drive By Night,\u201d about truck drivers. But \u201cLife on the Line\u201d muddles them hopelessly, first by way of its myriad and busy structural devices, and then by inserting flashbacks that have all the logic of hiccups, and then, finally, by overplaying its melodramatic hand.  Advertisement To John Travolta\u2019s credit, he doesn\u2019t phone in what could have been an indifferent role. His accent gets a little broad at times, but he\u2019s sincere and conscientious in his portrayal of a working man who doesn\u2019t want to be a hero, but will if he has to be. Sawa is better than okay too, as is Gil Bellows; only Bellefleur strays into egregious ham territory. The themes and the actors make you want the movie to be better, but the overreach combined with the sloppy sensationalism of the suspense scenes make \u201cLife on the Line\u201d the wrong kind of cinematic ordeal."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "The Letters", "Review": "Combine the subject of religious faith with the cinematic\r\ngenius of a Robert Bresson and you get a masterpiece like \u201cDiary of a Country\r\nPriest,\u201d a film stirring enough to move even staunch skeptics. Unfortunately,\r\nthe subject is more often approached by lesser talents, resulting in movies\r\nlike William Riead\u2019s \u201cThe Letters,\u201d about the life of Mother Teresa, a drama in\r\nwhich belief is reduced to well-meaning but inert treacle. To give the film credit where some is due: the look created\r\nby cinematographer Jack Green and production designer Aman Vidhate is handsome\r\nand commendably expensive looking, even when the setting is the most miserable\r\nslum in Calcutta. Whether it was the Vatican or another source that provided\r\nthe movie\u2019s funding, they got their money\u2019s worth in terms of production value. Advertisement On the level of dramatization, however, the film is almost\r\nan object lesson in how not to tell a\r\nstory like that of Mother Teresa. We start out learning that a woman with a\r\ntumor says she has been healed by a photograph of the recently departed nun,\r\nwhich sets Teresa on the fast track to sainthood. Investigating her candidacy\r\nfor the church, a Vatican priest (Rutger Hauer) visits Father Celeste van Exem\r\n(Max Von Sydow), who had been her spiritual advisor for many years, and who\r\nnarrates her story by using letters she wrote him over several decades. When his account begins, it\u2019s just after World War II and\r\nSister Theresa (Juliet Stevenson) is living in a Calcutta convent, where she\r\nteaches well-to-do Christian girls, and tries to allay their fears regarding the\r\nHindu-Muslim violence that\u2019s erupting due to the approach of India\u2019s\r\nindependence. Here as after, she\u2019s a model of blandly upbeat piety. The best\r\ncounsel she has offer her worried charges is, \u201cTry not to worry.\u201d This section of the film also introduces one of the film\u2019s\r\ncreakiest devices: having the political context explained by reporters talking\r\nwith each other. It involves dialogue as awful and straightforward as, \u201cSo you think India is going to suffer under\r\nthe burden of its birth as a modern nation?\u201d As we learn early on, Teresa is not content with her\r\nrelatively comfortable situation in the nunnery. After receiving instructions\r\nfrom God (which thankfully we don\u2019t hear) while on a train ride, she proclaims\r\nthat it\u2019s her mission to try alleviating the misery she sees all around her in\r\nCalcutta. But this is easier to proclaim than to do, necessitating a procession\r\nof dull, repetitious scenes in which her superiors at the convent resist her\r\ncampaign even as her appeals to the Vatican stretch on for months. Advertisement She eventually succeeds, and is granted permission to keep\r\nher vows and affiliation with the convent while being allowed to work in the\r\nslum outside it. There, her main challenge is overcoming the suspicions of its\r\nHindu residents. Initially, she\u2019s not out to provide food to the starving or\r\ncare to the ill. She says she just wants to teach the kids to read, but the\r\nslum dwellers think she aims to convert the tykes to Christianity.  Naturally, her purity of intent soon becomes apparent to\r\nmost of the skeptical Hindus, and her career as a savior of the slums is off\r\nand running. Some of her former students even elect to join her, creating\r\nconsternation among their parents and the convent higher-ups. This is, after\r\nall, a caste-bound society and upper-class girls touching the untouchables,\r\neven in Jesus\u2019 name, is frowned upon. Soon enough, though, Teresa\u2019s mission is\r\nsuccessful enough that she gets the Vatican to let her break free of the\r\nconvent and establish her own independent Missionaries of Charity, which leads\r\nto more conflict with the Hindus but also to the beginnings of her worldwide\r\nrenown for saintliness. The film\u2019s biggest problem is indicated by its title. Mother\r\nTeresa did leave behind a trove of letters. Though she wanted them burned, a\r\nselection that was published posthumously revealed her prolonged spiritual\r\nstruggles and sense that she was wholly removed from God. A few of these missives\r\nare quoted briefly in the movie, but they are completely at odds with what we\r\nsee on screen, where there\u2019s zero evidence of the protagonist\u2019s internal\r\nconflicts or devastating doubts. Stevenson\u2019s performance as the nun relies on a stooped\r\nposture, vaguely Yugoslavian accent and that blandly benign smile. Doubtless\r\nshe was not given the material for a more complex portrayal. Some films on\r\nfaith preach only to the converted. This one may leave even some of those\r\nunmoved. A final note: The film\u2019s music is credited to Ciaran Hope,\r\nbut unless the copy provided for review contained temp tracks, some of it seems\r\nto have been lifted directly from Hans Zimmer\u2019s score for \u201cThe Thin Red Line.\u201d"}

Now, I love me some Lulu and will always cherish that cinematically mod time capsule from 1967. But at least this most recent testament to the importance of education has much more on its brain than, say, dancing to groovy pop ditties.\u00a0Besides, science is hot right now as shown by the likes of \u201cInterstellar,\u201d \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d and \u201cThe Imitation Game.\u201d It helps immensely that the film\u2019s star, producer and Sidney Poitier fill-in, the eminently likable George Lopez in a rare dramatic role as a PhD-toting engineer forced to be a substitute science teacher, is clearly wearing his own heart on his sleeve in this true-life underdog story. Just as Poitier ended up serving as a mentor and father figure to his Cockney charges, Lopez\u2019s Fredi Cameron inadvertently becomes more than just an temporary instructor to the four Hispanic teens who beat the odds \u2013 as well as college-age teams hailing from MIT, Cornell and Virginia Tech \u2013 by winning a nationwide robotics contest.\u00a0 Advertisement But what truly saves \u201cSpare\u00a0Parts\u201d from being just a glorified after-school special is that these Mexican-born kids, who attend a scrappy working-class high school in Arizona, are all undocumented immigrants who live in constant fear that they or family members could be deported at any time. And without a birth certificate or other proof of citizenship, their chances for achieving their dreams are severely limited. The issue of so-called \u201cillegals\u201d could not be more timely and, if \u201cSpare\u00a0Parts\u201d does anything, it attempts to humanize the situation of those children who cope with this limbo-land existence without having had much choice in the matter.\u00a0 But admirable intentions can\u2019t entirely cover up major narrative flaws, and director Sean McNamara (who was behind the faith-based biopic \u201cSoul Surfer\u201d) spends too much time on the forced domestic melodramas and personal travails that each of the four students face and not enough on actually fleshing out their personalities. In fact, what should have been the main event \u2013 the actual competition that serves as the finale \u2013 arrives almost as an afterthought. Even Lopez\u2019s character turns out to have a heart-wrenching reason for his current situation, but it just gets lost in the shuffle. Each of the young actors has a distinctive appeal that isn\u2019t entirely capitalized upon and their rapport with Lopez and each other is what should be front and center. Making the biggest impression is Carlos PenaVega as Oscar, a driven-to-succeed senior whose undocumented status stands in the way of him pursuing his dream of enlisting in the Army. Instead, he turns to Lopez and asks to start a robotics club so he can enter the contest, which involves building an underwater vehicle. He ends up recruiting three other members: Cristian (David del Rio of \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d), a bullied computer geek who is the brains of the operation; Lorenzo (Jose Julian, Demian Bichir\u2019s son in \u201cA Better Life\u201d), a shaggy-haired mechanical whiz who isn\u2019t above breaking into vehicles now and then; and Luis (newcomer Oscar Guitirrez), a gentle giant who provides the muscles to carry the vehicle in and out of the water.\u00a0 Advertisement Of course, Lopez must have a love interest and she arrives in the welcome form of Marisa Tomei (in her second film opening this week besides \u201cLoitering With Intent\u201d) as a supportive fellow teacher who assists with some of the programming details involved with the robotics project. Naturally, she is a single mom with a sassy grade-school-age daughter who looks askance when Lopez shows up at their door. He quickly explains: \u201cWe have a coding lesson. That\u2019s not even a euphemism.\u201d Also on board is Jamie Lee Curtis as the school\u2019s unconventional principal who could easily be related to Eve Arden\u2019s principal in \u201cGrease\u201d as she makes announcements on the PA system about an anger management club that is mandatory \u201cfor the especially angry\u201d and comes up with not exactly by-the-book solutions to disciplinary problems. And it is good to see Esai Morales of \u201cLa Bamba\u201d fame looking handsome as ever, even if he is stuck with a thankless role as Lorenzo\u2019s perpetually disagreeable father. But, in the end, \u201cSpare\u00a0Parts\u201d proves to be more exhausting than it is inspiring. No A for effort here, just a passing grade for at least attempting to shine a light on a continuing problem that plagues the immigrant community."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Forever My Girl", "Review": "\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of Nicholas Sparks movies, you\u2019ll love \u2018Forever My Girl.\u2019\u201d And if you aren\u2019t? Consider yourself warned.  Actually, using this TV-ad version of a pick-up line in the service of selling a sentimental riff on second chances based on a series of popular YA books by author Heidi McLaughlin isn\u2019t an entirely bad idea.\u00a0 That\u2019s because the Sparks brand of big-screen adaptations was officially snuffed out in 2016 after No. 11, \u201cThe Choice,\u201d collected a measly $19 million in ticket sales. Therefore, one can\u2019t exactly fault the makers of \u201cForever My Girl\u201d for taking advantage of the void left in the cinematic universe for lovey-dovey schmaltz dressed up with family-values messages.  Advertisement Certainly, \u201cForever My Girl\"'s overtly predictable plot has more logic than any outing that takes place in what I like to call Sparks-landia, a sort of hybrid Harlequin romance-\u201cTwin Peaks\u201d bizarre-o world where kisses only happen when the spit-swappers are drenched with water, youthful flashback versions of characters look nothing like their older counterparts and tragedy is most likely to rear its head just as complete and utter happiness is within reach.  This yarn about Liam Page, an obscenely coddled country superstar (Alex Roe) who left his high-school\u00a0 sweetheart and fianc\u00e9e Josie (Jessica Rothe) high and dry at the altar eight years ago while fleeing\u00a0 small-town Louisiana doesn\u2019t traffic in drippy kisses, crazy coincidences or worldly-wise geezers. Instead, it is as bland as a mayonnaise sandwich on white bread\u2014after someone forgot the mayo. It is a movie where a lot seems to happen but it adds up to nothing much. Still, writer/dirctor Bethany Ashley Wolf has her own non-Sparks oddball plot points to contend with. That includes Liam\u2019s precious battered Nokia flip phone that contains Jodie\u2019s final message from years ago\u2014one he never replied to\u2014that takes up a goodly chunk of the running time. Also, grief over the loss of various departed loved ones and guilt over bad choices past and present drive the actions of the leads far more than any sense of re-ignited passion. While Wolf makes an admirable effort to populate the fictional Southern burg with a number of people of color, none of them are allowed to contribute in any meaningful way to the action. That includes what leads Liam to go back and finally face the music as well as Josie\u2019s wrath in the form of a literal punch to the gut. While watching the local news after a New Orleans concert, he learns that his best buddy from high school\u2014who happens to be African-American and a councilman\u2014has died in an accident. His desire to attend his pal\u2019s memorial might be sincere, but it feels more like an excuse to take a break from the pressures of fame. Liam is even too chicken to truly participate in the service, presided over by his pastor father (seasoned actor John Benjamin Hickey, a welcome counter-balance to the lesser knowns in the cast) who initially is not pleased to see that his prodigal son has returned.  Advertisement But what is most confusing about the direction the plot takes is that instead of trying to woo Josie back, Liam invests most of his efforts into winning over her Code-Red-level precocious seven-year-old daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson of \u201cAnt-Man\u201d)\u2014especially after doing the math and learning her name is Billie (Liam is Irish for William). Duh, of course, she is his kid. It is somewhat sweet that he starts making up for lost daddy time and is thrilled that Billie has inherited his talent for guitar strumming. But it feels like an eternity before actual romance enters the picture. Instead, fear of pet rabbits, the need for a child-size car seat and the ins and outs of ordering items online are dealt with. And, despite her protestations that she got along just fine without him, and even owns her own florist shop and everything, Josie is pretty much a pushover, despite whatever emotional speed bumps might crop up along the way.\u00a0  Not having read the book that \"Forever My Girl\" is based on, I have to trust the upset online fans who are peeved that Liam is no longer a bad-boy rocker and Josie is now a blonde instead of a brunette. Also at issue: Their child was originally a ten-year-old son. But Rothe\u2014not used to full advantage here\u2014has a certain star quality and can sing and dance, which you would only know if you saw her as one of Emma Stone\u2019s roommates in \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Roe is quite a doll, chest-hugging T-shirts and all, and has a good-enough voice to carry the not-bad original songs on the soundtrack. Besides, Travis Tritt kindly puts in a cameo and Blake Shelton is name-checked. Still, there is more pleasure to be had in the dwindling returns of CMT's\u00a0\u201cNashville\u201d than in this country soap-opera."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Being Charlie", "Review": "Nick Reiner, the 22-year-old son of director and actor Rob Reiner, isn\u2019t the first rich Hollywood kid to capitalize upon\u00a0 his experiences in rehab in order to enter the family business.\u00a0Just last year, Zephyr Benson, the 24-year-old son of \u201870s and \u201880s heartthrob Robby Benson (\u201cOne on One,\u201d \u201cIce Castles\u201d), wrote, directed, executive-produced and starred in \u201cStraight Outta Tompkins,\u201d about a well-off New York high-schooler who goes from recreational drug abuser to hardcore dealer.\u00a0Father Robby helped out as an executive producer and composed the film\u2019s score. But the end product was mostly a reflection of the younger Benson\u2019s still-in-the-formative-phase talents. Advertisement But the senior Reiner, whose filmmaking resume includes such durable classics as \u201cStand by Me,\u201d \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally \u2026\u201d and \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d actually directed, produced and helped shape his son\u2019s screenplay, which was partially influenced by their own contentious relationship over Nick\u2019s numerous failed attempts to stay clean. Interestingly enough, \u201cBeing Charlie\u201d (co-written with fellow recovering addict Matt Elisofon) proves to be a kind of\u00a0 career rehab for Dad. His behind-the-camera output has taken a regrettably persistent plunge in quality since the mid-\u201890s with such non-starters as \u201cAlex & Emma,\u201d \u201cRumor Has It\u2026,\u201d\u00a0 \u201cFlipped\u201d and \u201cAnd So It Goes.\u201d And about the only reason that the fountain of schmaltz known as \u201cThe Bucket List\u201d became a hit in 2007? It had a catchy title as well as first-time co-stars Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman as polar-opposite buddies on their death beds. Granted, \u201cBeing Charlie\u201d isn\u2019t the most original story. We have seen plenty of recalcitrant druggies and alcoholics in\u00a0 group counseling sessions on TV and film before (for me, nothing beats Edie Falco\u2019s amazing seven-season swan dive into the nightmare world of pain pill abuse on Showtime\u2019s \u201cNurse Jackie\u201d). But this dramedy about a troubled child born into privilege who runs away from a remote Utah facility on his 18th birthday and back to his parents\u2019 palatial Bel-Air mansion is an emotionally honest turn for the better for papa Reiner. There\u2019s a youthful kick to the dialogue along with a matter-of-fact edginess (including nudity, frank sexuality and crude language) in what feels like a vicarious portal into private woes that are public knowledge. In this case, Pop (\u201cPrincess Bride\u201d alum Cary Elwes) is David Mills, a retired actor turned politician who\u2019s in the midst of a campaign for the California governorship. The last thing he needs is for his junkie son Charlie (Nick Robinson of \u201cJurassic World\u201d) is to upend his chances to win during the final rounds of glad-handing. He gives this cynical, angry mess of an adolescent a choice: Either enter adult rehab, now that he has come of age, or be tossed out on the street and face charges for his Utah hooliganism. Advertisement Neither father nor son is averse to allowing their onscreen alter egos to come off badly. Robinson, whose boyish Sean Astin-like features and physique\u2014imagine a sardonic and bitter teenage hobbit\u2014provide a nice contrast to such lowlife behavior as stealing Oxycontin from a terminally ill old lady whose son has kindly given him a lift.\u00a0 Meanwhile, dad is a tough-love bully (mom, played by Susan Misner, is the comforting good cop) who greets his just-arrived son not with a much-needed hug but with a burly hairy stranger in an ugly Hawaiian shirt, who proceeds to commence with an intervention while spouting such well-worn clich\u00e9s as, \u201cNo one said that sobriety is easy.\u201d\u00a0 What would be easy is to hate David, but Elwes is able to summon a world of hurt, pain and frustration in the eyes of his character even while sporting a politician\u2019s plastic smile. So off Charlie goes into yet another treatment facility. But this one has a seemingly cool girl named Eva (Morgan Saylor) to break the monotony, who smokes clove cigarettes and matches him sarcastic comment-for-sarcastic comment. When he whines about being in rehab again, she counters, \u201cWhere would you like to be? Would you be OK with Iraq, Dafur, New Jersey?\u201d He smiles. \u201cMaybe not New Jersey.\u201d Eventually, they go to separate halfway houses split by gender. Turns out friendships are fine among program participants, but not romance. As a sympathetic counselor (hip-hop artist Common) explains to Charlie, \u201cGetting sober is a selfish thing. You got to help yourself first.\u201d Of course, his words will prove all too prophetic when a now-dutiful son still can\u2019t catch a break from his dad and resumes his old habits\u2014just in time for Election Day. While it\u2019s not exactly \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d \u201cBeing Charlie\u201d strives for authenticity in its main character\u2019s ups and downs even if the plot isn\u2019t as compelling as the performances. At least the material doesn\u2019t shy away from questioning the conventional wisdom behind such programs and suggests that they don\u2019t always fit the needs of everyone while profiting from repeat offenders. Also welcome are some original bits of inside-showbiz business that flavor the story. David, best known for a series of pirate films, is constantly pestered by adoring constituents who repeatedly parrot his \u201cYo ho ho\u201d catchphrase. One has to wonder how many times former \u201cAll in the Family\u201d star Reiner has been called \"Meathead\" over the years. Advertisement Also offering comic relief is the fact that Charlie is an aspiring stand-up artist who finds inspiration in such old-school joke tellers as Moms Mabley, George Carlin, Richard Pryor and Lord Buckley. Carl Reiner, granddad to Nick, would be proud. Even the fact that one of Charlie\u2019s rehab cohorts does a mean imitation of Nicholson\u2019s rebellious McMurphy in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest,\u201d as a means of survival, provides amusement.\u00a0 Working on \u201cBeing Charlie\u201d probably was a catharsis for Nick Reiner and it clearly has allowed his father to exorcise some of his lazier filmmaking tendencies of late. Like most family affairs, the film isn\u2019t perfect but it is memorable, and provides a passable high when it is over\u2014one that you haven\u2019t felt from a Rob Reiner production in ages."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Past Life", "Review": "Hollywood lost the knack of creating multi-leveled character dramas quite some time ago. For these, movie lovers now have to look to Europe, Asia\u2014and to the Middle East. The work of Asghar Farhadi, the Iranian writer/director, is knotty and ever engrossing, illuminating moral and ethical concerns in the contexts of domestic stories always rooted in immediate social reality. The recent films of the Israeli director Avi Nesher (who worked in Hollywood in the 1990s, largely on genre pictures) are not dissimilar\u2014full-bodied, complex, densely written. His latest, \u201cPast Life,\u201d is a story about reckoning with the past that begins with a bang. Advertisement The year is 1977. An Israeli choir is performing a concert in Berlin. In the audience an older woman peruses the concert program. She looks up the name of the lovely young woman giving a soprano solo during one piece. She recognizes that name. At a reception afterwards, the older woman, Agnieszka (Katarzyna Gniewkowska), approaches the young singer, Sephi Milch (Joy Rieger). Sephi speaks no German or Polish, and Agnieszka speaks no Hebrew. And yet, in the course of a fraught exchange during which Agnieszka grasps Sephi\u2019s wrist most aggressively, the point is made: Agnieszka knew Sephi\u2019s father, and Sephi\u2019s father was a murderer. Back home in Israel, the father we meet does not square with that description. Baruch Milch (Doron Tavory) is stiff and strict with his family but in his practice as a physician he\u2019s both no-nonsense and honestly compassionate. Sephi tells her older sister, Nana (Nelly Tagar) about her odd Berlin encounter and Nana, a journalist, takes up the story. Together they make some discoveries that disturb the hell out of them, and they confront their father. Baruch does not flinch. Rather, he welcomes the opportunity to unburden himself of the past and set the record straight. As a persecuted Jew during the Holocaust, he was protected by a Polish family. But he did not get out entirely \u201cclean\u201d so to speak.  The thread of discovery in this film\u2019s storyline is accompanied by others. There\u2019s Sephi\u2019s musical work. She\u2019s a singer, but also a composer, and her academy instructor is extremely discouraging. \u201cFocus on your singing, not your dreams.\u201d Her deliverance of sorts comes in the form of a visiting composer from Germany. Who happens to be a relative of the woman who accosted her at the concert in Berlin. In the meantime, Nana remains suspicious of her father, and her lack of faith in him turns into a disillusionment with life itself\u2014which is of little help to her spirits once she learns she has cancer.  Advertisement If \u201cPast Life\u201d stumbles at all, it\u2019s in the scenes in which it intercuts between Nana\u2019s medical traumas and Sephi\u2019s continued detective work on a trip to Warsaw\u2014the idea of a certain kind of faith constituting a sort of lifeline is made too literal for my tastes here. But the movie shines in all other respects. The characterizations are spectacularly convincing across the board, the acting honors those characterizations fully. The period detail is present but not ostentatious. And the movie\u2019s climax, in which all the threads are not-quite pulled together, is a very moving one, one in which forgiveness is sought, and the difficulty of bestowing forgiveness is acknowledged. This is a striking and thought-provoking picture."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Foot Fist Way", "Review": "The hero of \"The Foot Fist Way\" is loathsome and reprehensible and isn't a villain in any traditional sense. Five minutes spent in his company and my jaw was dropping. Ten minutes and I realized he existed outside any conventional notion of proper behavior. Children should not be allowed within a mile of this film, but it will appeal to \"Jackass\" fans and other devotees of the joyously ignorant. The hero is named Fred Simmons. He's played by Danny McBride with a cool confidence in the character's ability to transgress all ordinary rues of behavior. Fred runs a tae kwan do studio. He has the instincts of a fascist. His clients are drilled to obey him without question, to always call him \"sir,\" to respect him above all others. Some of his clients are 4 years old. He uses profanity around them (and to them) with cheerful oblivion. Advertisement To a boy about 9 years old, named Julio, he explains, \"'People are s#!t. The only person that you can trust is me, your tae kwan do instructor.\" Julio needs consoling after he's disrespected by little Stevie, who is maybe a year younger. To teach Stevie respect, Fred beats him up. Yes. There are several times in the movie when Fred pounds on kids. He doesn't pull his punches. Most people in the audience will wince and recoil. I did. Others will deal with that material by reasoning that the fight stunts are fake and staged, their purpose is to underline Fred's insectoid personality, and \"it's only a movie.\" Which side of that fence you come down on will have a lot to do with your reaction. A \"zero star\" rating for this movie could easily (in my case, even rapturously) be justified, and some fanboys will give it four. In all fairness, it belongs in the middle. Certainly \"The Foot Fist Way\" doesn't like Fred; it regards him as a man who has absorbed the lingo of the martial arts but doesn't have a clue about its codes of behavior. He's as close to a martial-arts practitioner as Father Guido Sarducci is to a Catholic priest. And the movie is often funny; I laughed in spite of myself. Fred's offensiveness applies across a wide range of behavior. He is insulting to his wife's dinner guests, tries to kiss and maul students in his office and asks one young woman who studies yoga: \"Have you ever heard of it saving anyone from a gang-rape type of situation?\" He has found very few friends. He introduces his students to his buddy from high school, Mike McAllister (Jody Hill, the director), who has a fifth-degree black belt and a penetrating stare that seems rehearsed in front of a mirror. Advertisement Fred and Mike worship above all others Chuck \"The Truck\" Wallace (Ben Best, the co-writer), a movie star whose credits include the intriguingly titled \"7 Rings of Pain 2.\" When Chuck appears at a nearby martial arts expo, Fred asks him to visit his studio's \"testing day,\" and then invites him home and shows him the master bedroom (\"the wife and I will bunk on the couch\"). That he assumes a movie star will want to spend the night is surprising, although perhaps less so when the Truck gets a look at Fred's wife, Suzie (Mary Jane Bostic). Fred leaves the two of them together while he leaves to teach a class, and is appalled when he returns to find Suzie and the Truck bouncing on the couch. What does he expect? Suzie has Xeroxes of her boobs and butt in \"work papers from the office\" and excuses her behavior at a party by saying \"I got really drunk -- Myrtle Beach drunk.\" McBride's performance is appallingly convincing as Fred. Despite all I've written, Fred comes across as a person who might almost exist in these vulgar times. McBride never tries to put a spin on anything, never strains for laughs. He says outrageous things in a level, middle-American monotone. He seems convinced of his own greatness, has no idea of his effect on others and seems oblivious to the manifest fact that he is very bad at tae kwan do. He is a real piece of work. I cannot recommend this movie, but I can describe it, and then it's up to you. If it sounds like a movie you would loathe, you are correct. If it doesn't, what can I tell you? What it does, it does well, even the point of its disgusting final scene. Note: The title is a literal English translation of tae kwan do."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "In the Land of Blood and Honey", "Review": "Although the United States and the United Nations had troops involved, I have a feeling that a good many Americans never worked up much interest in the Bosnian war. There were too many complexities for a soundbite. Was it Serbs against Croatians? Christians against Muslims? A free for all? Wasn't it all once Yugoslavia? Which side were we on? Or did we simply want all of them to stop fighting? I hope I don't sound snarky. The indifference of many moviegoers to world events affects the box office for any movie about such conflicts. It took a long struggle to get audiences worked up over \"The Hurt Locker,\" and even then, the key words were \"bomb disposal\" and not \"Iraq.\" Although we've spent a fortune in blood and resources in the Middle East, Hollywood has found audience indifference to events there. Even more so in the former Yugoslavia. When I mention Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia, how many nations have I named? Are they in fact nations? Here's a curveball: Where are the Balkans? Advertisement Given this reality, Angelina Jolie deserves admiration for making \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" as her first filmmaking project. She wrote it, directed it and cares deeply about its issues, having spent a lot of time on the ground there, unlike so many movie stars who only turn up for the photo op. Jolie has courage and convictions.  Her film is about a Serbian army officer named Danijel (Goran Kostic) and a Muslim artist named Ajla (Zana Marjanovic). Presumably Ajla is Serbian, too, but as a Muslim, she's hated by Christian Serbs. As part of the old Yugoslavia, the movie explains, all races and religions lived together in peace; a convenience of communism was that it dismissed such matters as bourgeois distractions from the class war. Now Marxism has fallen and humanity has returned to its familiar habit of hating thy neighbor. If I understand Jolie correctly, she believes the Christian Serbs have blood on their hands, having carried out genocidal massacres against Muslims. One of their pastimes is raping Muslim women. We see this in dismaying detail. However, Danijel's father, the veteran Serbian Gen. Nebojsa Vukojevich (Rade Serbedzija) has a chilling monologue recounting Muslim atrocities against Serbs. It's the same as it always is in sectarian warfare: The side you're on contains the victims, and the other side is the spawn of Satan. \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" settles down into a more limited melodrama. Danijel and Ajla feel a spark of love at a carefree dance on the last night of peace. The bomb that rips through a nightclub defines them as enemies, and not long after that, Danijel saves Ajla from certain rape and arranges for her special treatment in a prison. She gets her own sunny room, and in this privacy, they luxuriate in love in the afternoon. This begs the question of whether it is love, or whether Danijel wants to have sex with her and she feels it prudent to play along and buy her immunity with sex. Advertisement Danijel's brainstorm is to appoint Ajla the \"official artist\" of the Serbian army and set her to work painting the portraits of Serbian generals. As a pretext, this is fairly shabby, but it's a wonder how many powerful males would agree they should be the subject of an official portrait. Eventually, the bitter Gen. Vukojevich sees through his son's subterfuge, and then, well, you will find out yourself. The film does what all war films must, which is to reduce the incomprehensible suffering of countless people into the ultimate triumph of a few. \"Schindler's List\" is a great film that employed this tactic, and indeed almost all fiction films about Jewish prisoners during World War II are about those who survived. This has nothing to do with race, religion or nationality. It's all about the deeply embedded audience requirement to have an ending that provides happiness or at least catharsis.  One theme that Jolie foregrounds with particular emphasis is the way women on both sides are singled out for particular suffering simply on the basis of their sex. For some men, wearing a uniform provides them with a license to rape, and this is true I fear in every war. \"The Whistleblower,\" released earlier this year, starred Rachel Weisz as a United Nations peacekeeping officer in Bosnia who discovered that an American private security firm was kidnapping underage girls and using them to staff brothels. I found \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" to be moving and involving, but somehow reduced by its melodrama to a minor key. The scale of the ages-old evil and religious hatred in the region seemed to make the fates of these particular characters a matter of dramatic convenience. So what if Danijel shielded Ajla and his father found him out? It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Nuremberg: Its Lesson for Today", "Review": "Of all the many documentaries about the Holocaust, this was the first, made before the term was routinely linked to the event more properly called the Shoah. \"Nuremberg: Its Lesson for Today\" was edited from many hours of film taken at the 11-month Nuremberg Trial, which starting in 1945 placed 22 high-ranking Nazis on trial for crimes which together amounted to an outrage against decency. Assembled and edited by Stuart Schulberg with U. S. government funding, the film was exhibited throughout Germany in 1948 and 1949, and then taken from release and never seen in America. Advertisement It gave audiences the spectacle of seeing such iconic Nazis as G\u00f6ring, Borman, Hess and Speer, now humbled in an international courtroom, earphones clamped to their heads as they listen to the irrefutable evidence of their infamy. The film intercuts statements by the prosecution and defense and brief statements by some of the defendants.  \tAs the record of crimes is read out, he film edits in horrifying footage from other documentaries made for the U. S. Army by such as John Ford. I hadn't seen all of these images before. Jews being marched naked through the streets, gloating mobs empowered by flimsy armbands, skeletal \"subjects\" of \"medical experiments,\" the impossibly emaciated survivors of the death camps. An unspeakable sequence of corpses being piled into a mass grave, raising the question of why such film was shot, and why anyone agreed to be seen in it. The systematic extermination of six million Jews and nearly as many others was carried out boldly and openly, without apology, and when the unrepentant G\u00f6ring is asked in the dock if he ever said human life was worthless, his answer rings out: \"Jawhol!\" \tMost of the others seem repentant, and many in their final statements express resentment at what they see as Hitler's betrayal of their values, whatever they thought those were. It is revealing that even then, with the horrifying portrait of their evil deeds laid bare, they instinctively glorified Hitler so much that it was all his fault. Every single one of them was apparently only following orders, even those shown to have personally signed documents ordering the murder of children and those too weak to be useful slaves. \tThe film is not sophisticated; it is a bludgeon in words and images that cannot be presented otherwise. It was seen as a weapon of \"denazification.\" Some of it feels anachronistic, because at Nuremberg for the first time evidence was assembled and presented that has later become well known. Many Germans claimed at the time they didn't know what was being done in their names; for some of them it must have been true, and the purpose of this film was to show them their evil leaders, sitting in the dock--never, ever, in the footage here, ever looking at one another. Advertisement \tThe film, as I said, was never seen in America. This print has been assembled under the supervision of Sandra Schulberg, Stuart's daughter, and Josh Waletzky, who began with an archival print found in Berlin. They have made the decision to restore the original film. Good enough, but there could have been two modern additions. Subtitles would be invaluable to identify the defendants. And there could have been an explanation of why the film was suppressed.  At the time of the Nuremberg trial, it was a growing embarrassment that Stalin, an ally during the war, was as guilty of atrocities as anyone in the dock. And, as Robert McNamara much later said that Gen. Jimmy Doolittle told him after the bombing of Tokyo, that, too, was a war crime.  \tThis point is well made by Salon's film critic, Andrew O'Hehir, who writes: \"Even amid all the contradiction and ambiguity of the Nuremberg process, the argument made there was clear: All the nations of the world had to be held to the same standard, and every nation that waged aggressive warfare and committed war crimes, no matter how large or rich or powerful, would be judged accordingly.\""}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Merry Christmas", "Review": "Anna Condo's sarcastically titled \"Merry Christmas\" shows what happens when a group of upper-crust New Yorkers travel to the wilds of Pennsylvania to spend their Christmas holidays playing a murder mystery game at a remote bed and breakfast. The film spends no time on exposition, and so we have no idea who any of these people are in relation to one another before they put on outrageous Studio 54\u2013type outfits to immerse themselves in the disco dance club- themed murder mystery. The game is run by the B&B owner Kay, who questions each \"witness,\" and keeps the game from derailing over the course of the weekend. Meanwhile, the guests booze it up, play the piano, bicker constantly, and simmer tepidly with vague resentment and ennui. Through the playing of the game, the real life characters' true personalities emerge, and we can see that this is a pretty heartless bunch. Advertisement All of that would be fine (and even brilliant, perhaps) in the hands of, say, Luis Bunuel, but the overall effect in \"Merry Christmas\" is unfocused and lazy. The film feels like an acting game running its course, with various conflicts introduced throughout in a haphazard and \r\ncontrived manner. The problem is that the stakes are low to the point of non-existence, and there's just no excuse for that. \u00a0There is some attempt to create tension here, primarily through the world-weary cynical Brit Ted (Antony Langdon), who wants to open up a \"caviar bar\" in New York, mainly because he is sick of what he sees as the too-casual culture of today. He wants to see \"formality\" return to our public places, and he hopes some of his friends vacationing with him will invest in his \"caviar bar\". This is the only discernible \"want\" expressed in the picture, and it's hard to have any feelings about it one way or another. Even Ted seems bored by it. Filmed in two-and-a-half days at an actual B&B, the film is made up primarily of improvisation, and it shows. It gives one an increased appreciation for someone like John Cassavetes, whose great technical skill and understanding of story helped him create an environment of inspired and yet controlled chaos, where the audience truly believes that what they are seeing is spontaneous even though the actors are working within strict narrative guidelines. In \"Merry Christmas\", in contrast, we see a lot of people standing around chatting, making jokes, sipping wine, and having petty little arguments, but none of the moments have any underlying charge. The big conflict, which comes late in the game, is well done and effective (all of the actors are wonderful), but it is too little, too late. The camerawork is sloppy and awkward, with herky-jerk zooms and crazy pans to left and right looking for the event \r\nof the scene, often missing the faces we want to see by a mile. Halfway through, a homeless man who looks like either Jesus Christ or Rasputin shows up at the door and is invited to have a meal and join the game, even though he is nearly catatonic and entirely mute. Who is he? Is he part of the game? His appearance is a catalyst, for sure, and things get sort of ugly, not to mention the fact that everyone seems to be too busy patting themselves on the back for including a homeless man in their reindeer games to even notice that they are talking about him while he is right there. He disappears in the morning, leaving a cryptic note behind, which has intriguing possibilities, all left unexplored. A drunken conversation erupts about the concept of the \"idiot\" in Russian culture and literature, the wandering naive man baffled by wealth and cynicism, most accurately presented by Dostoevsky in his novel \"The Idiot'. But the idea is dropped. Too bad.  Advertisement There are moments when sparks fly, and that is due entirely to the gifts of the actors. The one African-American in the bunch (Angelique Cinelu) is asked at the table what it feels like to be the only black person present. Things get tense and awkward, and then explode later in another argument. Ted seems to bond with the B&B owner Kay, who is a born-again Christian with a floozy past. They banter about philosophy and sex and God, and there are all kinds of fascinating potentialities going on in their interactions, but it's all left behind and forgotten, like everything else in \"Merry Christmas\" that is potentially important or interesting.  Any one of these characters could have been a delicious villain. If you're going to create a bunch of characters as reprehensible as these, whose only experience of the recession is that \"last year we got to vacation in Aspen, this year we have to come here,\" then don't you want to create a higher-stakes environment for them, one in which they can really be set free? Don't you want to give them something better to do than just sit around and bicker?"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Fruitvale Station", "Review": "\"Fruitvale Station\" is about what we can imagine when we cast our gaze across the longstanding divides in this persistently, cancerously segregated American society. Like Paul Haggis' \"Crash,\" it is an ambitious do-gooder project aimed at penetrating hardened hearts. Unlike \"Crash,\" it has one solid, irrefutable piece of reality on which to anchor its fable-like teachable moments: The protagonist, Oscar Grant (the brilliant Michael B. Jordan), was a real 22-year-old man. The first thing we see in \"Fruitvale\" is the fatal moment that will lead to Oscar's death. Camera phone footage of Bay Area Rapid Transit cops beating Oscar and his friends on a subway platform ends with a gunshot. Advertisement The rest of the film dramatizes what Oscar was up to the day before he was killed, New Year's Eve 2009. I must paraphrase \"The Elephant Man\" to explain what it all amounts to: Oscar was not an animal. He was a human being. He had dreams and feelings. He cared for many people, and many people cared for him. His death left a giant crater in several lives. For those of you who understand that young black men are humans, not beasts, it might sound like a silly project to undertake. But consider what pop culture gives us to go on. For every complicated, vulnerable, flawed but basically decent black male character or celebrity there are a hundred loud, imbecilic thugs. Ho'wood spent six decades emasculating and lobotomizing black male characters, then traded on some cheap, crime-based empowerment narratives via blaxploitation.  The past three decades were about depicting the refurbished, physically potent and powerful black man as a moral and intellectual weakling. When we did get a glimpse of black male intelligence, it tended to be the psychopathic \"street smart\" variety. The pop icons among rap artists, the ones who dine with the corporate elite, promote prison culture, ruthless self-interest and jewelry. These images have fed racists, but they've also fed generations of black boys who learned that survival in a country that has little use for them means suppressing \"soft\" emotions and projecting a confidence that, in black skin, often comes off as arrogance. People who wanted to believe that blacks are inferior and black youth who took these images of aggressive inferiority as the underclass path to success joined hands to keep the dehumanization circus in business into the new century. Judging by its haunted atmosphere, \"Fruitvale Station\" knows all that history, and knows better than to confront it, fret over it or wag its finger at it. Writer-director Ryan Coogler simply lets us sample Oscar's daily routine and pressures. We get so caught up in his world, there's little time to respond to the cultural cues that would indicate to a certain segment of the audience that they're dealing with what \"Menace II Society\" called \"America's nightmare: young, black and don't give a fuck.\" Advertisement Oscar gives a fuck. He dresses like a homeboy and blasts his car stereo, but he is no thug. He's a father worrying about rent, bills and his daughter's schooling. He used to sell marijuana to get by, and losing his job at the local supermarket pushes him that much closer to dealing pot again. But he's been busted before, so another arrest could send him away from his daughter and her mother (the radiant Melonie Diaz) for a good while.  His explosive side stems more from the fact that he shares little of his mental burdens with anyone. At least the raging bull Jake LaMotta had the boxing ring. Oscar has few outlets, but his girlfriend and daughter and friends and family keep him \"lifted up\" \u2014 a term his mother (Octavia Spencer) uses when gathering them all to pray for Oscar to survive the bullet that pierced his lung. \"Fruitvale Station\" reminded me of a social realist classic by Ken Loach (\"Raining Stones,\" \"The Wind that Shakes the Barley\", \"Land and Freedom\"). Its volatile, deeply sensitive and charismatic protagonist is in the mold of Loach's working-class antiheroes. The only important differences are that Ryan Coogler's debut feature is set in the US, not the UK, and his hero is black. If these differences don't sound like much, try to imagine Trayvon Martin as a white kid. Would there be as many commentators speculating that Trayvon's attitude caused his own death at the hands of the man who stalked him with a gun? Or let's imagine the new cult classic, Nicholas Winding Refn's \"Drive,\" with Michael K. Williams in the lead role as a stoic, brutally violent protector, instead of blond sex symbol Ryan Gosling. In many ways, \"Fruitvale Station\" is as green and earnest as \"Boyz N the Hood,\" a debut film made by another alumnus of Coogler's alma mater, USC: John Singleton. Yet its ambition is closer to that of the most important American indie film in at least a decade, \u00a0Patrick Wang's\u00a0\"In the Family,\" a must-see that's now available on DVD. It's about a gay father (played by Wang) who's cruelly separated from his son after his partner, the boy's biological father, dies. The film becomes something much grander than a woe-is-he political statement as Wang slowly, stealthily brings various strangers into the picture.\u00a0These folks, inscrutable and potentially hostile at first, become the protagonist's passionate allies, revealing useful talents and resources we didn't expect. It's all because Wang's character draws them in with his sunny, embracing, fair-minded spirit.\u00a0 It's the same spirit that Oscar brings to encounters with those who don't automatically write him off. The genius of Jordan's performance, and the sense of portent that Coogler builds around it, is in showing how aware Oscar was that his freedom and even his life \r\ncould depend on overturning a superficial, unfair impression.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Samaritan", "Review": "One difference between film noir and more straightforward crime pictures is that noir is more open to human flaws and likes to embed them in twisty plot lines. \"The Samaritan\" isn't a great noir, but it's true to the tradition and gives Samuel L. Jackson one of his best recent roles. He plays Foley, a con man who was forced to kill his best friend and fellow grifter. He did 25 years in prison for murder, and as we meet him, he's just getting out on parole. He makes a promise to himself that he will never go behind bars again, and that means having nothing to do with crime in any form. He gets a job working construction. Advertisement It's not that easy. A man named Ethan (Luke Kirby) approaches him with an offer: An easy \"Samaritan\" con, which means the con man poses as a friend doing the mark a favor. Foley says no. Ethan continues to follow him, turning up everywhere. Foley tells him go to hell, using that anger beneath lowered brows that Jackson does so well. The film takes place in Toronto, not a city often identified with noir, but then noir has no geographical requirements. Perhaps that accounts for the mid-Atlantic polish of a crime boss like Xavier (Tom Wilkinson), who has given Ethan a compelling reason to mastermind the con: He will kill him if he doesn't.  Here, as so often, Wilkinson has a compelling screen presence. He's a British actor I first remember particularly noticing in \"In the Bedroom\" (2001), but he was in many films before and since \u2014 more than 100 credits in all. You may recall him from \"Michael Clayton,\" and he has the most touching role in the current \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.\" Anyway, Ethan has his reasons to recruit Foley. And he eventually reveals another one, which I won't reveal. The strategy is to make it necessary for Foley to return to a life of crime, and Ethan has cards in his hand that Foley doesn't even suspect. The film does a good job of establishing Foley's lonely single life. He works, he lives in a little flat, he hangs out at a bar from the old days, he learns most of his onetime pals are dead or locked up. And now there must be a woman. All noirs have one, usually one with secrets. In the bar, he befriends Iris (Ruth Negga), a slight, sweet-faced girl who needs defending. There's something about her vulnerability that appeals to him. She's like a wounded bird. Hers isn't an erotic appeal, at least not obviously, but who knows where it could lead? Advertisement I think we're at the point in the story now where I'd better make my excuses and leave. In a proper noir nothing is at it seems, and I'll leave it at that. I will observe, however, that director David Weaver, who co-wrote the script with Elan Mastai, does a precise job of springing his surprises and drawing all the plot threads together into a knot, which he yanks in one of those delicious showdown scenes where personal urgencies and moral compulsions get all mixed up with death and blood. Jackson was a co-producer on this film, probably because he liked the complexity of the role. \"The Samaritan\" has the patience to establish its setup, and that's important in a noir, in which action deferred is more important than action indulged. The final resolution is perhaps a little hasty. But there's something here. Note: The film, which opens Friday at Facets Cinematheque, is available everywhere via IFC on Demand."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Clown", "Review": "Jon Watts made waves at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival with\r\nhis throwback thriller \u201cCop Car\u201d getting enough attention that he was given a\r\nGolden Ticket to join Club MCU by directing 2017\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming.\u201d\r\nInterestingly, Watts had another film in the can that had never been released,\r\n2014\u2019s \u201cClown,\u201d produced by Eli Roth, and just this week is getting a small\r\ntheatrical and VOD release. Why was \u201cClown\u201d buried? Is it an example of a film\r\nthat is only being seen because of its creator\u2019s subsequent fame and should\r\nhave been left in a shallow cinema grave? Or is it evidence of the talent\r\nthat Watts would later show on a larger stage? The answer is somewhere in\r\nbetween. While \u201cClown\u201d is far from the disastrous misfire that typically stains\r\nVOD horror movies (most range from awful to \u201cI never want to see a movie again\u201d),\r\nit comes apart about halfway through, losing a very difficult tonal balance.\r\nHaving said that, there\u2019s more to like here than the studio burial would have\r\nyou believe.  Advertisement It\u2019s actually most likely that the studio is semi-burying \u201cClown\u201d (and didn't screen it for critics) because they\u2019re a little scared of it. While it\u2019s not as all-out gory as some\r\nof the films also produced by Eli Roth, it hinges on a no-no even in horror\r\ncinema\u2014the violent, bloody, sometimes cannibalistic death of children. Horror fans will watch adults, especially morally\r\ncorrupt ones, get drawn and quartered, but putting kids in jeopardy is\r\ngenerally considered a bridge too far. Seeing kids eaten by a killer clown?\r\nKind of hard to put into a trailer. Long before he\u2019s devouring rugrats, Kent (Andy Powers) is an\r\naverage family man. When a clown doesn\u2019t show up for his son\u2019s birthday party,\r\nhe finds an old suit in a house he\u2019s trying to sell in his role as a\r\nrealtor. The party goes off without a hitch but he falls asleep on the couch in\r\nhis full clown gear. The next day, he notices that the red rubber nose won\u2019t\r\ncome off and the wig seems to have fused with his real hair. When he tries to\r\nget the suit off, even with a handsaw, he fails. As if spending the rest of\r\nyour life looking like a vagabond Ronald McDonald isn\u2019t bad enough, Kent notices that he\r\nhas an new taste for the blood of children. A man (Peter Stormare, in full Stormare Mode) with\r\na history with the clown suit tells Kent and his wife (an ineffective Laura Allen) that decapitation\r\nis the only answer before the demon in the suit takes over Kent completely. The first act of \u201cClown\u201d works because it lays a lot of its\r\narc at the feet of a totally-committed performance by Powers. To pull off the\r\nstory of a man who can\u2019t get out of a clown suit requires \u201cNicolas Cage in\r\nVampire\u2019s Kiss\u201d levels of commitment and Powers is completely in for the ride.\r\nWatts\u2019 tone is also playful in this first act, such as when Kent tries to blow\r\nhis brains out and ends up with a rainbow spray on the wall. (Spoiler: It doesn\u2019t\r\nwork.)  The problem with \u201cClown\u201d is that it eventually tries to get\r\nserious and loses its way in two key places. First, there\u2019s kind of a gross\r\nscene in which a bully gets his comeuppance in a most grotesque way that doesn\u2019t\r\nwork tonally (and when kid death doesn\u2019t work tonally, it really doesn\u2019t work). More long-term, the final act basically turns\r\nKent into a child-eating demon, taking Powers out of the film as an actor and\r\nforcing Allen to do a lot of heavy emoting to try and\r\nsave her husband. It\u2019s around here that one starts adding up the film\u2019s missed\r\nopportunities as well. It doesn\u2019t really provide any truly frightening \u201cscary\r\nclown\u201d imagery to add to that crowded subgenre and it takes no opportunities to\r\nbecome something deeper in terms of commentary on fatherhood, masculinity, even\r\nchildhood icons, etc. It\u2019s really just a \u201ckiller clown movie.\u201d One has to give\r\nWatts and Powers credit for really going for it and not pulling back from their\r\ndisturbing concept, but that credit runs out before the movie is over.

{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "One Week and a Day", "Review": "\u201cOne Week and a Day\u201d is an incredibly tactful tragicomedy from debut writer/director Asaph Polonsky about two parents figuring out what to do next after their son dies. In the long list of movies about death, this is one of the most original in recent memory, if for its emotional delicacy in sparing us hollow, tear-gushing grandiosity, and for its attitude on life: In most movies about grief, you are waiting for the characters to cry. This is a marvelous story about loss in which you are waiting for them to laugh.\u00a0 Advertisement The movie starts end of the week-long morning period of shiva, which is being held for Ronnie, the son of Eyal (Shai Avivi) and Vicky (Jenya Dodina). The friends and family have left (and their reccurring neighbors/former friends are dead space, about the only major writing flaw in this film) while the middle-aged married couple try to regain their balance in the world. Eyal becomes fixated on getting back a blanket that his son had in the hospital, a trip that leads him to a now-occupied hospital room but a bag of Ronnie's medicinal marijuana. Eyal's supposed to be focused on securing the two burial plots next to his son, before they are reserved by someone else. Instead, he is concerned with putting the weed to use, but he can\u2019t roll a joint and he has never smoked before.\u00a0 Polonsky's film has a pivotal sequence early on where Eyal, portrayed vividly as both boyish and destroyed by Avivi, tries to roll up the papers and keeps ripping them. It\u2019s not a laugh-out-loud funny moment but its cathartic humor shines within such grave simplicity: you just want this sad man to get high. The whole presence of marijuana in Polonky\u2019s story ushers in delicate comic relief, especially as Eyal and the viewer are given a moment to escape the sobering phenomenon of his and Vicky\u2019s grief. But it only adds more layers to the tone of this incredibly thoughtful screenplay, the kind that creates honest drama out of acute dialogue and just a few characters and locations.\u00a0 Eyal eventually receives help in rolling and smoking joints from his son\u2019s old friend Zooler (Tomer Kapon), a dopey, smiley young guy who becomes yet another symbol of Polonsky\u2019s directorial confidence and emotional intelligence. He\u2019s the character with the most color and least visible trauma, like Sean Penn\u2019s Spicoli taken down a notch. But he is a fictional being of such unwitting compassion that he too enhances this story. Even when he performs a balls-to-the-wall air guitar solo act\u2014viewed in one take from behind the shoulders of an unamused Eyal\u2014he remains a sincere contrast to the sadness that a film like this needs to handle very carefully.\u00a0 Advertisement But death is an independent process too, as expressed through the actions of Vicky and a quietly devastating performance by Dodina. She presents herself as more put together than Eyal because she has more emotional distance. Vicky has a cold cool to her while heading out to see the grave or when she\u2019s especially unamused by Eyal\u2019s pot. And while Eyal skips work after the shiva, Vicky tries to resume her job as a substitute teacher, only to find out that the school insists on keeping the already-hired substitute. A sense of normalcy finally comes to her life when she is called about a dentist appointment she had initially forgotten. When she\u2019s finally in the dentist\u2019s chair, alone with her thoughts and unable to speak, she provides images of unexpected catharsis, thanks in part to Dodina\u2019s intricate stoicism. As the film follows these three characters in their day after shiva, it takes on an unexpected form as a quirky comedy, albeit with a lot of soul. Polonsky does this with a couple of very sweet scenes featuring a girl whose mother is in the same cancer ward Ronnie used to be, doing some playacting that involves stealing lab coats and pretending to be doctors. While that idea might sound twee, in Polonsky\u2019s film it soars because of the emotional weight in place, the significance such a small act has to each character and the delicacy with how Polonsky overplays none of it. In one of its most unforgettable successes, \u201cOne Week and a Day\u201d restores a sense of heart, and a positive definition, to the often condescending idea of a crowd-pleasing film. The emotional effect is one that must be seen, and felt, to be believed.\u00a0 Even then, Polonsky's debut has more to say. In its final act, the movie reckons with the sadness Eyal and Vicky have been able to distract themselves from, and achieves unexpected power by introducing us to a completely new character. This person has their own life story, and Eyal just listens. It becomes a fitting gesture from Polonsky\u2019s gorgeous film, which gradually crescendoes with the beauty of unexpected compassion, all while concerning the stark reality that life goes on, no matter who dies.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Il Divo", "Review": "They would seem to be opposites, but on the basis of two recent films, the longtime Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and the longtime fashion emperor Valentino were surprisingly similar. Both are seen as intensely private, rarely happy, single-minded in pursuit of their ambitions, cool in their personal relationships, and ruling as if by divine right. A difference is that Valentino was never accused of criminal activities. Another difference is that they\u2019ve inspired radically different films. \u201cValentino: The Last Emperor\u201d is reverential; \u201cIl Divo\u201d is fascinated by what it presents as Andreotti\u2019s lifelong career of skullduggery. Still serving the Italian state as a senator for life at the age of 90, he entered politics in 1946 and was prime minister during most of the years between 1972 and 1992. During much of that time, he was widely believed to have associations with the Mafia, and \u201cIl Divo\u201d shows him imagining a confession to his wife in which he links himself to 236 deaths. One of those might include the murder of Aldo Moro, his political rival, who was kidnapped by the Red Brigades and killed after 54 days when Andreotti shockingly refused to negotiate a ransom. Advertisement What you would not guess from this history is that \u201cIl Divo\u201d is a deadpan, horrified comedy. The writer-director Paolo Sorrentino is fascinated by Andreotti\u2019s wicked intelligence, his awareness that so many believe the worst of him, his enigmatic mask. He fascinated his contemporaries; Margaret Thatcher once said of him, \u201cHe seemed to have a positive aversion to principle, even a conviction that a man of principle was doomed to be a figure of fun.\u201d He said of himself: \u201cPower is a disease one has no desire to be cured of.\u201d He knew where all the strings were attached and once told a pope: \u201cYour Holiness, forgive me, but you don\u2019t know the Vatican like I do.\u201d What is astonishing is that a film like this could be made about a man still living. One imagines Andreotti reflecting that it only enhances his larger-than-life image. His Christian Democrats ruled postwar Italy until 1992, by which time the party was in such disrepute that it no longer survives. Yet he prevails. He prevails, and the legend is only enhanced by the great performance here by Toni Servillo, an actor who succeeds in making him hypnotizing by supplying him with an almost cheerful lack of the slightest magnetism. Here was a man who suppressed the usual charm of a politician, perhaps aware he worked better as an enigma. Was he thinking of himself when he famously said, \u201cYou sin in thinking bad about people; but, often, you guess right.\u201d The film proceeds like a black comedy version of \"The Godfather,\" crossed with Oliver Stone\u2019s \"Nixon.\" It assembles a roll call of figures in postwar Italian politics, society and crime, uses an abundance of names and dates in captions, and makes us despair of keeping track until we realize we\u2019re not intended to \u2014 the purpose of all these facts is simply to evoke the sheer scope and breadth of Andreotti\u2019s machinations. The more we learn, the more fascinated we become, as Servillo portrays him as poker-faced, hunched, impassive, observing all, revealing little, wise and cynical beyond measure. Imagine Dick Cheney without the jolly charisma. Advertisement After I saw \u201cIl Divo,\u201d I suppose I should have felt indignation. I suppose I should also have felt that way after \"The Godfather.\" But such films present such mesmerizing figures that I simply regard them, astonished. I wonder if just before a snake strikes you, you think: What an amazing snake! The Italians, you have to admit, get good value for their money. Who could possibly follow Andreotti as prime minister? Try Silvio Berlusconi. Note: \u201cIl Divo\u201d was also the nickname of Julius Caesar, a nickname suggesting \u201cthe divine one.\u201d Andreotti\u2019s other nicknames: Beelzebub, the Hunchback, the Sphinx and the Black Pope."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Muppets Most Wanted", "Review": "\"Muppets Most Wanted\" opens with a self-referential song that comments on the fact that sequels are never quite as good as the film that inspired them and then goes on to prove the point.   When everyone's favorite frog, bear, pig, and whatever Gonzo is returned in 2011 for \"The Muppets,\" the result was a surprising creative success. And just as the pond-hopping \"The Great Muppet Caper\" followed on the heels of \"The Muppet Movie\" over thirty years ago, it makes a certain degree of sense that this generation's Muppet sequel would also be a crime-laced adventure for the wisecracking vaudevillian puppets. However, the creative team behind this follow-up have misplaced and mis-prioritized so much of what worked about \"The Muppets\" that it's hard to believe sometimes that it's not an entirely different crew. \"Muppets Most Wanted\" has the smell of straight-to-DVD sequel from top to bottom; something that only superficially resembles what came before.  Advertisement The most significant and bizarre problem with \"Muppets Most Wanted\" is a lack of a protagonist. That might sound silly for a film cast largely with puppets but \"The Muppets\" gave us multiple characters to follow, including not just the introduction of the charming Walter but the return of Kermit alongside engaging characters played by Jason Segel and Amy Adams. In a baffling screenwriting move, Bobin and Nicholas Stoller not only separate Kermit from his friends for most of the film's running time but don't fill in that gap with another lead to follow. It is a story without an anchor, a film that bounces back and forth between its sometimes entertaining subplots but without a hint of thematic density. Yes, I know it's \"just\" a lighthearted family diversion but the reasons \"The Muppet Movie\" and \"The Muppets\" resonated was because they touched on issues that were identifiable to both kids and adults\u2014we all knew what Kermit meant when he said it wasn't easy being green or had our own rainbow connection to find. \"Muppets Most Wanted\" touches on little more than silly accents.  Now that \"The Muppet Show\" is back on the international radar in the world of these films, Dominic Badguy (a winning Ricky Gervais) swoops in to encourage Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, and the rest of the gang to go on a world tour. Of course, with a name like Badguy, their new manager has a dastardly plan up his sleeve. On their first stop in Germany, Kermit is kidnapped and shuttled off to a Russian gulag, where he is meant to take the place of an international criminal \"bad frog\" named Constantine, who just happens to look exactly like Kermie, just with one of the cinematically historic signs of evil\u2014a facial mole.   While poor Kermit is trying to convince his guard Nadya (Tina Fey) that he's a framed frog and keep on the good side of fellow inmates played by, among others, Ray Liotta, Danny Trejo, and Jemaine Clement, Constantine is working with Dominic on their endgame, stealing The Crown Jewels while using The Muppets tour as a cover. Essentially just to get the gang to a number of fun locales (and allow for endless stream of cameos from the likes of Salma Hayek, Christoph Waltz, Chloe Grace Moretz, Saoirse Ronan, and dozens more), the items needed to lift the jewels are spread out around Europe. As more of the Muppets start to wonder at Constantine/Kermit's odd behavior, Sam Eagle and an Interpol agent named Jean Pierre Napoleon (an inspired Ty Burrell) track the crimes being left in their wake. In the screenwriters' most egregious error, we spend more time with Constantine than any of the classic Muppets, and I longed for someone to root for other than Kermit in a Siberian prison. It would have been so much smarter to have Walter, a solid new hero from the last film, figure out the deception immediately and then work to unveil it for everyone else.  Advertisement There are undeniably inspired bits in \"Muppets Most Wanted\"\u2014one is tempted to recommend it just to see Ray Liotta performing a number from \"A Chorus Line\" in a Russian gulag, and Burrell's running gag about the differences between European crime solvers and his American counterpart gets laughs\u2014but the comedic tone is inarguably more frantic and haphazard than arguably ever before in this series. Even the songs, again composed by \"Flight of the Conchords\" vet Bret McKenzie, have the tone of afterthought; B-sides to ideas explored in the previous film. The music gets notably stronger as the film goes on but the first few numbers had me longing for something as catchy and clever as \"Life's a Happy Song\". The best Muppet movies have been so closely associated with their music over the years and no one is going to be humming a single bar of a \"Muppets Most Wanted\" track on the way to the parking garage.  While it doesn't help that \"Muppets Most Wanted\" is an unacceptable 112 minutes long, I must admit that it's never gratingly bad. It's not as creatively bankrupt as the worst family films as the creators still have that anything-for-a-laugh aesthetic that demands you only wait a few seconds between jokes. At its best, it captures the show's often-manic pace, shuffling one bit off the stage as the next one starts up. There are laughs here and there but The Muppets haven't been one of our most enduring franchises thanks to films that can be labeled little more than sporadically entertaining."}

Is this in dispute? Are there any theologians who support such actions? Of all the most severe punishments of both religions, this is the one most skewed against women, and the one most convenient for men. To be sure, no witches have been burned at the stake in many long years, and few ever were. But women are still stoned to death in some Islamic countries, including Iran, where \u201cThe Stoning of Soraya M.\u201d is set. The practice survives in backward rural areas, and the law turns a blind eye. It is rare, and Iran denies it, but the French journalist Freidoune Sahebjam\u2019s best-selling The Stoning of Soraya M. (1994) appears to be quite authentic. A woman really was stoned to death on trumped-up adultery charges, brought for the convenience of her husband, who desired to marry a young girl. Advertisement Cyrus Nowrasteh\u2019s \u201cThe Stoning of Soraya M.\u201d does not dramatize this story in a subtle way. You might argue that the stoning of a woman to death is not a subtle subject. But it would be helpful to have it told in a way that shows how almost the entire population of a village allows it to happen, even though most of them know of the woman\u2019s innocence and her husband\u2019s vile motives. How does a lynch mob form? Instead, we\u2019re given a village populated primarily by overacted villains and moral cowards. Against them is one strong voice: the widow Zahra, Soraya\u2019s aunt. She\u2019s played by Shohreh Aghdashloo, the Oscar nominee from \u201cHouse of Sand and Fog\u201d (2003). She knows all the players and all the motives and publicly calls them on it, to no avail. She\u2019s a \u201ccrazy woman,\u201d says the husband, Ali (Navid Negahban). The phrase crazy woman can fall easily from the tongue, and it\u2019s worth remembering that in Victorian England a wife could be locked in an asylum for life on only her husband\u2019s signature (see the great novel The Quincunx). Ali the husband is an immoral monster. His intended child bride has not been asked if she wants to marry him; the marriage has been arranged. The village mullah goes along because Ali threatens to blackmail him about an old prison sentence. The mayor knows it is wrong and doubts Allah desires it but lacks the courage to do much more than mutter. The stoning sequence itself is one of the most unbearable experiences I have had at the movies. I learn it lasts nearly 20 minutes. Soraya (Mozhan Marno) is buried in a hole up to the waist. Village boys collect stones of a good throwing weight in a wheelbarrow. We see blow after blow, as blood pours from her face and body. She accepts this as her fate, as indeed it is. She did nothing that was not innocent and kind. Advertisement The stoning took place in 1986, after the Islamic Revolution. Fundamentalists were in power then and enforced their strictures. The measures they introduced are being challenged today in the streets of Iran, and similar extremism is the practice in our dear friend Saudi Arabia. Those with objections fear crushing reprisal. The enforcers have power, position and wealth to gain and dare their enemies to go against what they say is God\u2019s will. The message is that if a religion requires practices that seem evil to its members, they should resign from that religion. If it condones a death penalty that is visited unequally on members of a specific gender, race or class, it is immoral. There cannot be a reward for following it blindly, because only a thoughtful choice has meaning. At heaven\u2019s gate you cannot say, \u201cI always followed the herd.\u201d \u201cThe Stoning of Soraya M.\u201d has such a powerful stoning sequence that I recommend it if only for its brutal ideological message. That the pitiful death of Soraya is followed by a false Hollywood upbeat ending involving tape recordings and silliness about a car that won\u2019t start is simply shameful. Nowrasteh, born in Colorado, attended the USC Film School. Is that what they teach there? When you are telling the story of a woman being stoned to death, you may not be able to use everything you learned in class."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Film Critic", "Review": "If we agree with famous Baltimore contrarian H.L. Mencken that a\u00a0critic\u00a0must, above all things, have a \"capacity for gusto,\" then Victor Tallez (Rafael Spregelburd), the Buenos Aires\u00a0film\u00a0critic\u00a0moping his way through Hern\u00e1n Guerschuny's \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is failing spectacularly in his calling. The \"capacity for gusto\" has been sucked out of him. He sees too many\u00a0films, and all of them are bad. He has lost touch with the unwashed hoi polloi, who adore clich\u00e9d rom-coms, who approach things with (as he sees it) an uncritical eye. He rolls his eyes at gusto. Tallez is a clich\u00e9 himself, the\u00a0critic\u00a0who scoffs at popular taste, who feels the entire world has derailed into a pit of sentimentality and bad art. \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" pokes fun at\u00a0criticism\u00a0(at least Tallez's cranky prissy brand of it), and while lampooning self-serious intellectual\u00a0critics\u00a0is akin to shooting fish in a barrel, \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" takes a light and knowing tone, spoofing the sacred cows of the\u00a0critic\u00a0world, and cramming every scene with visual\u00a0film\u00a0clich\u00e9s that act like a \"Where's Waldo?\" of cinema.\u00a0 Advertisement The opening of \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" shows the back of Tallez's head as he walks through the Buenos Aires streets, all as he drones on in French about his \"maladie du cinema.\" \"Films\u00a0are suffocating me,\" he states flatly, and the condition is incurable. Set against grainy black-and-white street-scene images, reminiscent of the French New Wave, Tallez comes across as a dissociated gloomy figure, trapped in the confines of his own head. At the end of the opening, he drones, again in French, \"At one point one may want to know why I think in French.\" [Beat.] \"I have no idea.\" Of course, an Argentinian\u00a0film\u00a0critic, who sees the world as a French New Wave\u00a0film, who is working on an \"exhaustive\" study of Godard, would \"think\" in French.\u00a0 Tallez is a nationally syndicated\u00a0film\u00a0critic, and seems glumly proud of the fact that he hasn't given a review \"Four Seats\" (his newspaper gives \"seats\" instead of \"stars\") in years. He spends his days in a monotonous manner, going to press screenings, then out for coffee with a group of\u00a0critics. Back at the office, his boss rails at Tallez, scolding him for his harsh reviews (\"You are a terrorist of taste\"). Tallez's harshest critiques go to rom-coms, and he lectures his credulous niece (Telma Crisanti), who loves rom-coms and can recite \"Jerry Maguire\" from memory, on what is wrong with the genre. Tallez describes the rom-com clich\u00e9s: \"Do not forget to put rain, lots of rain. And a run. We don't know why, but they always run.\" (Cue image of Billy Crystal running to find Meg Ryan in \"Harry Met Sally.\") Tallez is a drip.\u00a0 Of course, over the course of \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic,\" Tallez meets an adorable and carefree woman named Sofia (Dolores Fonzi), who challenges all of his hard-won contempt for rom-coms. Sofia breezes into his life, wearing a big furry beret, carrying her Pink Panther bike helmet under her arm, a Manic Pixie Dream Girl par extraordinaire. She has no job, she is \"quirky\" (one of her quirks is kleptomania), she takes Tallez to experimental performance art pieces (Tallez drones in French on the voiceover: \"My God. Enough. Kill me.\") and, strangely enough, she has nothing better to do with her time than to hang out with this crank and show him how beautiful life can be. In its own fluffy way, Sofia is a critique of the movie clich\u00e9: woman as inspirational figure sprinkling fairy-dust over gloomy self-absorbed men drawn into their magical circle. When they first kiss, fireworks go off in the sky. Tallez has entered the rom-com of his nightmares and finds that it's not actually all that bad.\u00a0 Advertisement Guerschuny (who wrote and directed) takes a self-conscious and self-aware approach. \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is loaded with references to other\u00a0films, and the style changes drastically as the various subplots kick into gear. When Sofia enters, suddenly the\u00a0film\u00a0becomes a rom-com, with cute music and montage sequences, where she tries on adorable hats at a street market. In a darker subplot, Tallez is stalked by a young director, furious about Tallez's review of his\u00a0film. The director sneers at Tallez, \"It took me 5 years to make it. It took you 5 minutes to destroy it.\" The director shows up everywhere, in crowd scenes, across streets, glaring through the space at Tallez, and as that rises in importance, the\u00a0film veers into a thriller, complete with dark empty movie theatres, and ominous tracking shots.\u00a0 The most interesting thing about \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is how it poses the possibility that there may be more truth in clich\u00e9s than Tallez perhaps wants to acknowledge. The reason mass audiences respond to rom-coms (for example) is that such\u00a0films\u00a0approach the truth of the matter of Love, even in their non-realistic, sometimes tiresome ways. Love is something universal, and who you fall in love with is a matter of the greatest importance to regular people who are not characters in a movie. Rom-coms acknowledge that sense of importance, and the urgency of those clich\u00e9d moments (running through the rain, or running through an airport to stop your beloved from getting on a plane to Antarctica, or whatever, everyone is running), express that urgency in a formula that often works. If it didn't work, it wouldn't be used so much. As embarrassing as it is to Tallez, he discovers that falling in love with someone actually does feel like fireworks going off over the bay.\u00a0 Hern\u00e1n Guerschuny is a longtime\u00a0film\u00a0critic\u00a0(he runs the magazine Haciendo Cine) and \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is his debut. Many of the details in \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" are spot-on: the conversations at press screenings (arguing about whether a\u00a0film\u00a0is good/bad enough for The Berlinale), people making statements about how they hate comedy because \"there's nothing to discuss\", the constant references to cinema, the casual comments made during conversation, like: \"In high school I spent more time following the career of some director of photography than getting a girl's phone number.\" Much of \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is an in-joke aimed at an insular sub-culture, and so it lacks a sense of significant commentary on its subject matter (think of \"In a Lonely Place,\" or \"Adaptation,\" or \"Barton Fink\" for comparison). \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is an extended spoof more than anything else (it may have worked better as a short\u00a0film), and its targets are pretty shallow, but it still includes many entertaining and insightful elements.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Squeeze", "Review": "Here\u2019s a movie that would benefit from being broken up by late-night television commercials. \u201cThe Squeeze\u201d plays like something you\u2019d stumble across on USA Network back in the days of\u00a0\u201cUp All Night.\u201d All that\u2019s missing is TV host Rhonda Shear and an ad for that spray paint-based fake hair in a can. \u201cThe Squeeze\u201d even has the courtesy to end with The Proclaimers\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles),\u201d a 25-year old song that will never shake its association with the dismal Johnny Depp movie \u201cBenny and Joon\u201d. Were I not 70 pounds heavier and decades more wrinkled, I\u2019d have sworn I was watching this in 1993. Advertisement The only way you might glean a favorable review\u2019s worth of enjoyment from \u201cThe Squeeze\u201d is if you like being sucked into '90s-era basic cable black holes. There is little else worth mentioning about this derivative, clunky, haphazardly written and visually dull sports movie except the performances by Christopher McDonald and Michael Nouri. My entire star rating goes to their antagonistic gambler characters. They say a movie is only as good as its villains. These villains are too good for \u201cThe Squeeze.\u201d The film opens with a flash-forward of our golfer hero Augustus Maximus Baccus (Jeremy Sumpter) being threatened by Nouri\u2019s character, Jimmy Diamonds. Diamonds demands that Augie throw\u00a0tomorrow\u2019s\u00a0golf game or else he\u2019ll be killed. We\u2019ll have to wait 45 minutes before we see Jimmy D. again, because we\u2019re immediately sent back to the past to learn more about Augie. Before we learn All About Augie, however, we\u2019re assaulted by the onscreen words I wish all moviedom would ban: \u201cBased on a true story.\u201d That phrase often serves as an excuse for filmmakers to poorly shape scenarios and drama. They think we\u2019ll buy anything because it\u2019s supposedly true. Well, truth may be stranger than fiction, but it doesn\u2019t always result in good fiction. We\u2019ll meet the real Augie in a snapshot during the closing credits. If this movie accurately reflects the real story, the only question I have for him is \u201chow does one live a life built entirely out of old movie clich\u00e9s?\u201d Please teach me how to do this. But I digress. It\u2019s hard to get a bead on what \u201cThe Squeeze\u201d wants to be tonally. At its core is yet another one of those tales where small-town folks somehow outwit big-city criminals with schemes so rudimentary and predictable that it\u2019s hard to fathom how the criminals managed to stay employed in lives of crime. The first 15 minutes feel like a typical Christian movie, with Jesus and God appearing in almost every line of lousy dialogue. Then it veers away from that tone (you\u2019ll know exactly when it does) and becomes a drama about the perils of easy money. Then, it takes a very suspect dive into Las Vegas sleaziness, complete with a minority character serving as an exotic Other representing sex and drugs. It then dives into a completely suspenseless winner-take-all golf game/hustle that ends in what I think is supposed to be comedy. Advertisement The story kicks off when the radio broadcast of Augie\u2019s record-breaking win at his hometown golf course catches the ear of an out-of-towner named Riverboat (Christopher MacDonald). Riverboat likes to gamble on golf, and he\u2019s apparently quite the success. He and his partner \u201cThe Bank\u201d (Katherine LaNasa) seduce Augie with wads of cash he can obtain by helping them hustle unsuspecting fellow gamblers. Augie looks more like a pizza delivery guy than a\u00a0successful golfer (the movie literally admits this), so he\u2019s the perfect candidate. Plus, he needs the money to help his family out. It\u2019s one of these golf hustles that introduces Augie to Las Vegas, Jimmy Diamonds and the fists of Jimmy\u2019s henchmen. As expected, there\u2019s a gorgeous, small-town girl waiting patiently for our hero to get his act together and return to her. In \u201cThe Squeeze\u201d she\u2019s called Natalie (Jillian Murray) and she\u2019s the sassy, sexy, mature and patient voice of reason whose warnings are never heeded in movies like this. You don\u2019t have to be Riverboat nor Jimmy Diamonds to know not to bet against the possibility that Natalie will assist in saving Jimmy\u2019s ass before The Proclaimers torment us with their end-credits earworm. Writer-director Terry Jastrow has a history producing golf specials and documentaries on TV. Knowing this, I wish he\u2019d just made a documentary about the real Augie. Jastrow\u2019s love of golf shines through when he\u2019s lensing the golf scenes, but the drama itself is subpar. The real Augie simply telling his story to the camera would be far more compelling and entertaining than this. In Jastrow\u2019s defense, the director does get hole-in-one level performances out of MacDonald and Nouri. Nouri isn\u2019t given enough screen time to be as effective as MacDonald, but their scenes together make one forget about Sumpter\u2019s bland character. At one point, Jimmy Diamonds asks \u201chave you ever seen the Devil?\u201d as Riverboat enters the room, and MacDonald fits Satan\u2019s shoes nicely. Dressed in suits and a ubiquitous hat, oozing charm and chewing on a Southern accent with the tenacity of Meryl Streep channeling Foghorn Leghorn, MacDonald makes the movie. Even when he\u2019s forced by the screenplay to appear uncharacteristically sinister (something Nouri\u2019s character does better), MacDonald never loses his successful grasp on Riverboat. \u00a0\u201cThe Squeeze\u201d rides off into the sunset with the wrong duo of characters, leaving the villains in an awful, out of left field comic situation. This would have been forgivable sitting in my apartment back in 1994, watching the cable I stole. As a $15 NYC movie ticket in 2015, it\u2019s a sucker bet I wouldn\u2019t take. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Tales of Halloween", "Review": "\"Tales of Halloween\" is a party of a movie made up of ten different shorts, celebrating more than just a holiday but the tricking and treating found year-round in horror films. Lined by an amicable sense of dark humor and a sporadically amusing bloodlust, this hit-or-miss compilation could bring Halloween cheer to genre fans, especially if a prop candy bar named Carpenter, or narration from Adrienne Barbeau, sounds like a horror convention dream come true.\u00a0Before getting into what makes \"Tales of Halloween\" a relatively mixed bag,\u00a0let's start with the delightfully cuckoo. The\u00a0genre giddiness within Darren Lynn Bousman's \"The Night Billy Raised Hell\" is downright contagious, especially as it goes full speed on the pranking potential of Halloween,\u00a0albeit performed by a devilish little boy and a\u00a0crazy old man. It's one of the smaller bites in the full course but it has the most flavor, as a full aesthetic package (with\u00a0cartoonish sound design) and a bonkers sense of humor that continues to push its boundaries right up to the end. It's also a refreshing chaser to opening short \"Sweet Tooth\" (by\u00a0Dave Parker), which doesn't have the same imagination in its tale of a ghoul who punishes on those who\u00a0don't share their candy (the ghoul itself is frighteningly designed).\u00a0 Advertisement Another high point comes towards the end of the shorts series with Mike Mendez's \"Friday the 31st,\" which pits a comically shameless Jason Voorhees knock-off against a very unexpected force; slasher genre jokes ensue, and a lot of blood sprays people in the face. In comparison, it improves upon the previous battling neighbors short \"This Means War\" (directed by John Skipp and Andrew Kasch) by harnessing the efficiency of scant dialogue in a visually interesting short, while being more inventive with its final showdown, a swan dive into gory madness.\u00a0 For a genre that tends to see women in a certain, shallow way (see: the non-sarcastic costume design for the women as opposed to the men throughout these mini-films), two shorts in particular here try to challenge these representations, but both fail overall. \"Tales of Halloween\" creator Axelle Carolyn's short \"Grim Grinning Ghost,\" about a woman who might be stalked by a ghoul, is damned by the sluggish pacing that haunted her debut \"Soulmate.\" And then there's Lucky McKee's \"Ding Dong,\" about a woman who becomes a witch to her husband after the loss of a child and inability to conceive. It's another project with his tedious \"but I'm a feminist!\" attitude, providing a representation both winking and literal of a personal horror, one not justified by a conclusion that's ultimately ineffectual, if not dangerous by its end. But, it does have some ace make-up work in making the emasculating wife a very sinister red.\u00a0 As for the lesser shorts that truly move in and out of the anthology, each at least boasts some type of perk. Paul Solet's \"The Weak and the Wicked,\" which oddly uses the same kind of twist from his more recommendable feature \"Dark Summer,\" has a cool Sergio Leone influence within its anticlimactic tale of bullying; lead actress Grace Phipps steals the show with a snap of her fingers, the fate of the bullied protagonist proving to be less interesting. Or, there's Adam Gierasch's \"Trick,\" which has more finesse in its cinematography than macabre story, as it clumsily dumps body parts on the common punchline that no one can be trusted on Halloween. Even Ryan Schifrin's grating \"The Ransom of Rusty Rex\" has an exciting nod to previous anthology \"Twilight Zone: The Movie,\" which then volleys the gesture of approval with a John Landis cameo.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Tales of Halloween\" wraps up with one of its biggest cheeses, director Neil Marshall (\"The Descent\"), who unleashes a flesh-eating Jack-o'-Lantern's murder spree a la a direct-to-video splatter-fest shrunken into a few minutes, tying together all of the film's previous tales. Like nearly all of the nine shorts before it, it ends on a klutzy note. Nevertheless, this very funny short has the bloody, goofy taste of \"Tales of Halloween,\" a project that is overall better produced than it is directed. The compilation\u00a0indulges with constant cameos and references, but is best as a showcase for a few promising filmmakers from indie horror (including cinematographers, make-up designers, and some writers), many of whom are primed for a spookier nightmare."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Free Birds", "Review": "Everything about \"Free Birds\" feels perfunctory, from its generic title and holiday setting to its starry voice cast and undistinguished use of 3-D.  The puns and pop culture references are bountiful in this Thanksgiving-themed animated adventure, but even by the standards of a kids movie, the wordplay is pretty lame. To play the filmmakers' game, there is simply too much stuffing in this bird: too many characters, subplots, gags and ideas, which include time travel, nutrition and genocide. Director and co-writer Jimmy Hayward (\"Horton Hears a Who!\" \"Jonah Hex\") offers a film that\u2019s sufficiently colorful and cluttered with wise-cracking creatures\u2014talking turkeys, to be specific\u2014but with the possibility of death lurking about at all times, it never feels particularly lively. And it certainly doesn\u2019t help that Hayward\u2019s script, which he co-wrote with longtime Kevin Smith collaborator Scott Mosier (from a story by David I. Stern and John J. Strauss\u2014why must these films always be cobbled together by committee?) bears such resemblance to superior movies.  Advertisement The time-travel element is reminiscent specifically of \"The Terminator\" and \"Back to the Future,\" while the glorious \"Chicken Run\" depicted the idea of fleeing fowl in far more clever, charming fashion. But the best parts of \"Free Bird\" actually occur in the beginning, in the present day, before anyone has gone anywhere.  Owen Wilson provides his familiar, nasal twang as the voice of Reggie, the smartest turkey on the farm and the only one who questions why he and his buddies get to eat so much corn every day. He realizes that the \"turkey paradise\" his pals dream of is actually their own vicious slaughter before ending up as the main course in a delicious Thanksgiving meal.  When Reggie tries to warn his fellow turkeys about their imminent demise, they offer him up to the farmer for sacrifice. This puts him in the perfect position when the President of the United States arrives (whom Hayward voices in a Clintonian rasp) to choose a turkey to receive the annual pardon. Reggie gets to fly to Camp David, where he luxuriates in the wonders of trashy telenovelas, fuzzy slippers and pizza delivery.  It\u2019s no coincidence that the most fun Reggie\u2019s ever had in his life is the most fun we have, too.\u00a0 From here, \"Free Birds\" flies in a wildly different direction, with Reggie being kidnapped and forced into a secret mission by a large, intense and possibly delusional turkey named Jake (Woody Harrelson).  Jake insists that The Great Turkey has visited him and entrusted him with the responsibility of traveling back in time to Plymouth Colony in 1621, just before the first Thanksgiving, to keep turkeys off the menu and save his brethren for all eternity. (Never mind that turkey exists in sandwiches and chili and burgers and many other wonderful food items.) And what do you know? There just happens to be a time machine at Camp David (which goes by the code name STEVE and is voiced by George Takei). Magically, Reggie and Jake commandeer the craft and reach their destination. But once they arrive in the past, they find themselves the targets of Myles Standish (Colm Meaney), who\u2019s trying to hunt as many turkeys as possible to feed the starving colonists as well as the nearby Native Americans for their upcoming feast. A feisty turkey named Jenny (Amy Poehler) and her father, the tribal leader Chief Broadbeak (Keith David), rescue them and the four join forces to a) destroy the humans\u2019 weapons, b) rescue their captive brethren, and c) prevent turkey from becoming the staple of Thanksgiving feasts forever. Nothing in this complicated, convoluted narrative is ever particularly thrilling or funny. The romance that forms between Reggie and Jenny feels needless and uninspired, while the heart-tugging family drama at the end seems unearned and forced. Worst of all, \"Free Birds\" aims for historical significance by using the turkey slayings as a metaphor for the cruelties Native Americans have suffered.  In the end, very little about \"Free Birds\" is appetizing.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Fast & Furious", "Review": "\"Fast & Furious\" is exactly and precisely what you'd expect. Nothing more, unfortunately. You get your cars that are fast and your characters that are furious. You should. They know how to make these movies by now. Producer Neil Moritz is on his fourth, and director Justin Lin on his second. Vin Diesel and other major actors are back from \"The Fast and the Furious\" (2001). All they left behind were two definite articles. This is an expertly made action film, by which I mean the special effects are good and the acting is extremely basic. The screenplay rotates these nouns through various assortments of dialogue: Race. Driver(s). Nitro. Meth. Sister. FBI. Border. Dead. Mexico. Murder. Prison. Traffic violations. Tunnel. Muscle car. Import. Plymouth. Funeral. Helicopter(s). Toretto. Ten seconds. Corona. Cocaine. Advertisement The plot. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has been in the Dominican Republic for the last six years but now returns to the United States, where he is a wanted man. Probable charges: vehicular homicide, murder, smuggling, dating an FBI agent's sister. Reason for return: Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), the girl he loved, has been killed. After Toretto's arrest all those years ago, he was allowed to escape by FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker). O'Conner's back, this time on a task force to track down Dom and also the leader of a drug cartel. This provides a scaffolding on which to hang the body of the movie, which involves a series of chase scenes, fights, explosions and sexy women who would like to make themselves available to Toretto, to no avail. He is singleminded. The pre-title chase scene is pretty amazing. Toretto and his group team up in four racing vehicles to pursue a truck hauling not one, not two, not three, but four enormous tanks of gasoline. Their method: Toretto drives close behind the fourth tank, girl climbs out of sun roof, stands on hood, leaps to ladder on back of tank, climbs on top, runs to front of tank, leaps down, uncouples tank from third one. The reason the girl does this while Toretto drives is, I guess, well, you know what they say about women drivers. Ever see a truck hauling four enormous gas containers? I haven't. On a narrow mountain road? With a sudden steep incline around a curve, when it narrows to one lane? Not me. Why are they going to this trouble? So their buddies can have free gas for a street race that night in L.A.? I say let them buy their own damn gas. The race is down city streets with ordinary traffic on them. Then the wrong way on an expressway. Not a cop in sight. Where are the TV news choppers when you want them? This would get huge ratings. I dunno. I admire the craft involved, but the movie leaves me profoundly indifferent. After three earlier movies in the series, which have been transmuted into video games, why do we need a fourth one? Oh. I just answered my own question. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Whistleblower", "Review": "Here is a film to fill you with rage. It is based on the true story of Kathryn Bolkovac, a police officer from Lincoln, Neb., who accepted an offer to join the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. While there, she uncovered direct evidence that underage girls were being held captive and bought and sold in a profitable sex trafficking operation. When she presented her evidence to her superiors, it was ignored. When she persisted, she was fired. There is more. The American private security firm, DynCorp International, whose operatives committed these crimes and tried to cover them up, is still employed by the U.S. government in Iraq and Afghanistan, and was used in Louisiana after Katrina. Although its activities were at the center of Bolkovac's report, she found that local police and U.N. peacekeepers themselves were also deeply involved.  Advertisement Although \"The Whistleblower\" is a fictional film, these facts were supported by a British labor tribunal that investigated her claim against DynCorp, finding the corporation's defense \"completely unbelievable.\" That high officials in the U.N. Human Rights Commission also were aware of the sex trafficking is unbelievable to me.  The movie, constructed as a relentless and frightening thriller, stars Rachel Weisz in one of her best performances, portraying Bolkovac as a quiet, intense woman who has heroism thrust upon her by the evidence of her own eyes. Investigating complaints of rape and forced prostitution, she visits private clubs where underage girls are exhibited and fondled, held captive, threatened with death and actually sold to individuals to take and do with what they desired. These young women were lured to Bosnia under false pretenses. Their passports were taken so they could not escape across borders. Because of the curfews in effect in the area at the time, local citizens could not leave their homes at night, and so the customers at the clubs were, by definition, law-enforcement personnel not under curfew.  In her almost singlehanded investigation, Bolkovac is often seen in scary nighttime situations; walking down a street or entering her apartment seems risky. The movie is not above employing images of female vulnerability to manipulate us, and it succeeds. What makes it so effective is that Weisz doesn't play her character as any species of action heroine, but simply as a competent, dutiful cop who is naive enough to believe her job should be performed by the book. After she comes to know some of the victims personally, after they trust her, the job becomes more of a mission. David Strathairn co-stars as Peter Ward, one of Bolkovac's few colleagues who seems trustworthy. Vanessa Redgrave plays Madeleine Rees, a real-life official of the Human Rights Commission, who offers moral support and also warnings that Bolkovac's life may be in danger. Monica Bellucci is Laura Levin, a bureaucrat who refuses to help repatriate young women, because, in cruel logic, they have no passports. And David Hewlett is Fred Murray, Bolkovac's superior officer, who is himself part of the cover-up. Advertisement The film's director and co-writer, Larysa Kondracki, infuses the film with an atmosphere of pervading male menace, which, after all, is based on facts and court findings. In wartime, the rape of civilians is often considered one of the spoils, and no doubt it is a morale-booster for troops who feel in danger. It is also a cruel blow against enemies \u2014 but these girls are not enemies but simply and pathetically victims.  The male world in which Bolkovac moves contains many men who regard her as a sex object, and see sexual aggression as an expression of their masculinity. In this boys' club, it is expected that members will go along, participate or turn a blind eye. There is unspecified but clearly sensed danger if they don't. On one hand, they can party and enjoy sex. On the other, they can lose their jobs, their salaries, their pensions and perhaps their lives. For 20 years the news has reported from time to time of crimes alleged by employees of paid defense contractors. These cases rarely seem to result in change, and the stories continue. We can only guess what may be going unreported. \"The Whistleblower\" offers chilling evidence of why that seems to be so."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Far from Men", "Review": "Albert Camus\u2019 short story, \u201cThe Guest,\u201d rather resembles\r\nErnest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Killers\u201d in that it uses an almost anecdotal storyline\r\nto illuminate major\u2014hell, one might even say \u201cexistential\u201d\u2014themes. Camus\u2019 work\r\nhas only three characters: a police officer, his prisoner, and a schoolteacher\r\nthe police officer charges with taking said prisoner to a court and jail a\r\ncouple of hours away. The teacher\u2019s refusal sets the tale in motion,\r\ndemonstrating how choice is destiny, but sometimes choice is not an option.\r\nHemingway\u2019s somehow even sparser story focuses on its two title characters, and\r\na man called The Swede, their victim, who offers his murderers no resistance;\r\nrecounted second hand, the tellers of the tale ponder The Swede\u2019s stoic\r\nacceptance of his fate.  Advertisement \u201cThe Killers\u201d was made into a movie in the late \u201840s, one\r\nthat extrapolated The Swede\u2019s backstory in full. A pretty great film noir\r\ndirected by Robert Siodmak and starring Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner. But an\r\nalmost entirely different animal in spirit than Hemingway\u2019s great story.\r\nSimilarly, writer/director David Oelhoffen expands the parameters of Camus\u2019\r\nstory, set in Algeria in the early \u201850s, in \"Far From Men\".\u00a0 Schoolteacher Daru, a quiet,\r\nself-possessed man, is played by Viggo Mortensen; his charge, Mohamed, by Reda\r\nKateb. This expansion of the story sees Daru escorting Mohamed even as he\r\nencourages the prisoner to break away. As the two men grow to trust each other,\r\nthe impossibility of Mohamed\u2019s situation is illuminated. Yes, he is guilty of a\r\ncrime. The crime, he says, was the result of a him-or-me-and-my-family\r\ndecision. Left to hang by themselves, though, his actions will create an endless\r\nand destructive cycle of recrimination. If he escapes, he insists, nothing will\r\nbe solved. Only his own sacrifice will make things right. \u201cGetting killed by\r\nthe French is the only solution.\u201d  Daru has a hard time grasping this. Their journey offers other\r\nchallenges as it progresses. There is rain. The Algerian rebellion against\r\nFrench rule had begun. It hasn\u2019t had much impact on the mountain village where\r\nDaru teaches, but Daru and Mohamed meet some soldiers on their trip, which\r\nprovides an opportunity for some backstory. It also recalls, in a low-key way,\r\nan episode from Leone\u2019s \u201cThe Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.\u201d There is a very understated brothel,\r\nrecollecting \u201cThe Last Detail.\u201d There is a lot of stark natural beauty,\r\ncaptured very well by cinematographer Guillame Deffontaines. And there is\u2026not a\r\nlot more, as it happens.\u00a0 In addition to muffing the d\u00e9nouement of the story on\r\nwhich it\u2019s based, \u201cFar From Men\u201d is also the kind of movie in which sobriety and a stalwart sense of seriousness yield more inertia than profundity. Its solemnity\r\nnever becomes actively oppressive, but it shuts out not just humor but grace.\r\nWhat it falls back on, rather than the troubling truth illuminated in Camus\u2019\r\nstory, is the movie-standard gaze of compassion, here proffered by Mortensen,\r\nwho, it must be admitted, does it well. His French isn\u2019t bad either, although\r\nhis character gets a backstory that explains its sometimes halting quality\r\n(French natives are worse sticklers for accents than American movie critics, as\r\nit happens). His work, and Kateb\u2019s, are exemplary. It\u2019s also pleasant to see\r\nthe great Angela Molina, so memorable in Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s final film \u201cThat Obscure\r\nObject of Desire,\u201d pop up here in a small role. But the movie remains something\r\nof a Distinguished Slog. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Cloud Atlas", "Review": "Even as I was watching \"Cloud Atlas\" the first time, I knew I would need to see it again. Now that I've seen it the second time, I know I'd like to see it a third time \u2014 but I no longer believe repeated viewings will solve anything. To borrow Churchill's description of Russia, \"it is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.\" It fascinates in the moment. It's getting from one moment to the next that is tricky. Surely this is one of the most ambitious films ever made. The little world of film criticism has been alive with interpretations of it, which propose to explain something that lies outside explanation. Any explanation of a work of art must be found in it, not taken to it. As a film teacher, I was always being told by students that a film by David Lynch, say, or Warner Herzog, was \"a retelling of the life of Christ, say, or 'Moby Dick.' \" My standard reply was: Maybe it's simply the telling of itself. Advertisement Yet \"Cloud Atlas\" cries out for an explanation, and surely you've noticed that I've been tap-dancing around one. I could tell you that it relates six stories taking place between the years 1849 and 2346. I could tell you that the same actors appear in different roles, playing characters of different races, genders and ages. Some are not even human, but fabricants. I could tell you that the acting and makeup are so effective that often I had no idea if I was looking at Tom Hanks, Halle Berry or Jim Broadbent. I could tell you that, and what help is it? I could tell you that each segment is a refashioning of the story contained in the previous one. That the same birthmark turns up in every period of time. That a repeated motif is that all lives are connected by a thirst for freedom. That the movie was inspired by the much-loved novel of the same name by David Mitchell. That in the novel, the stories were told in chronological order, and then circled back again from end to beginning. That the movie finds its connections through the reappearances of the same actors in different roles and deliberately refers to one story from within another. Now are you wiser? I'm treading water. And now could follow a very long paragraph introducing and describing the different characters played by the actors. But you would lose your way all the same, because many of the performances and disguises are so cunningly effective. I could tell you that Halle Berry's work as a mid-1970s investigative reporter works well for me, and the gnarly wisdom of Tom Hanks as an old man telling tales is the most impenetrable.  I despair. I think you will want to see this daring and visionary film, directed by Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer and Andy Wachowski. Anywhere you go where movie people gather, it will be discussed. Deep theories will be proposed. Someone will say, \"I don't know what in the hell I saw.\" The names of Freud and Jung will come up. And now you expect me to unwrap the mystery from the enigma and present you with a nice shiny riddle? Advertisement Sometimes the key to one movie can be suggested by another one. We know that the title refers to early drawings of the shapes and behavior of clouds. Not long ago I saw a Swedish film, \"Simon and the Oaks,\" about a day-dreaming boy who formed a bond with an oak tree. In its limbs, he would lie reading books of imagination and then allow his eyes to rest on the clouds overhead. As he read a book about desert wanderers, the clouds seemed to take shape as a ghostly caravan of camels in procession across the sky. I was never, ever bored by \"Cloud Atlas.\" On my second viewing, I gave up any attempt to work out the logical connections between the segments, stories and characters. What was important was that I set my mind free to play. Clouds do not really look like camels or sailing ships or castles in the sky. They are simply a natural process at work. So too, perhaps, are our lives. Because we have minds and clouds do not, we desire freedom. That is the shape the characters in \"Cloud Atlas\" take, and how they attempt to direct our thoughts. Any concrete, factual attempt to nail the film down to cold fact, to tell you what it \"means,\" is as pointless as trying to build a clockwork orange.  But, oh, what a film this is! And what a demonstration of the magical, dreamlike qualities of the cinema. And what an opportunity for the actors. And what a leap by the directors, who free themselves from the chains of narrative continuity. And then the wisdom of the old man staring into the flames makes perfect sense."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain", "Review": "I laughed out loud when comedian Kevin Hart said \"thank you and good night\" at the end of \"Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain,\" because I thought he was kidding. Hart was just hitting his stride (literally \u2014 he was telling a joke about riding a horse) when his show abruptly ended. Since I wasn't the only one who chuckled, a wave of genuine shock rolled through the theater where I saw it when the credits started rolling. A smattering of applause was drowned out by murmurs of surprise. Like me, people were calculating their \"running time to movie theater ticket price ratio\" and coming up with an unsatisfying quotient.  Advertisement \"That's it?!\" asked a woman behind me. \"How long was that s*#t?\"  \"A hour and 10 minutes,\" replied the disappointed voice next to her.  \"We should have waited for the damn bootleg!\"  I wanted to kiss this woman, because she read my mind. I paid $15 for a 71-minute stand-up comedy movie whose first 20 minutes feature no stand-up comedy whatsoever. With credits, that's 47 minutes of jokes, several of which are only mildly funny, if funny at all. To say I felt ripped off is an understatement. Granted, most comedy routines run 30-60 minutes on Comedy Central or HBO, but considering that I was sitting in a theater rather than in my drawers on my couch, I expected more. \"Richard Pryor: Live in Concert,\" the greatest stand-up movie ever made, runs 78 minutes, 72 of which is Pryor's master class of hilarity. \"Eddie Murphy: Raw,\" whose opening skit format \"Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain\" mimics, spends about 7 minutes on its skit before providing 80 or so minutes of Murphy having a nervous breakdown onstage. Chris Rock's classic \"Bring the Pain\" runs an hour, but he didn't make you leave your house to see it.  I provide these numbers as a gauge for my expectations, but I acknowledge your mileage may vary.  Perhaps I would have been more forgiving if \"Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain\" didn't make me wait so long for Hart to take the stage. The film opens with an unfunny party scene shot with a camera shaky enough to make me sick. This is followed by an interminable trip into the comedian's navel. Hart addresses the camera to comment on being called a \"LAB,\" or a \"local-ass bitch.\" (My old Black ass needs an Ebonics review; I've never heard that one before.) To prove that he has international appeal, Hart shows clip after clip of his performances from around the world. I noted that not ONE of these clips features Hart telling a single joke. Instead, it's him saying \"thank you [fill in the location]!!\" ad nauseum. It goes on so long that I actually fell asleep. When I awakened, Hart's little cartoon plane was still flying to locations to prove he was a big star. Didn't we know this before we bought our tickets? Why did we need a commercial for Kevin Hart opening a movie we paid to see? The montage continues with numerous people professing their love for Hart, telling us how they found him on the Internet. Even people who can't speak a word of English gush adulation, which reminded me of Murphy's \"Raw\" comments about foreigners who can only understand the curses in his routines. I was hoping one such person would ambush Hart in the clips, speaking an unintelligible language peppered with English profanities. No such luck befell me, just more clips of fans and Hart's entourage sleeping on a bus. Advertisement When Hart finally does take the stage at sold out Madison Square Garden, a stage equipped with geysers of fire he occasionally employs for comic punctuation, I crossed my fingers and hoped for big laughs. And laugh I did on occasion, because Kevin Hart is indeed a talented comedian. This is just not his best material. There's an unfortunate \"been there, done that\" feeling to \"Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain,\" with the comedian riffing on the usual Def Comedy Jam/BET ComicView targets: psychotic Black women, clueless friends who mess up your ability to successfully cheat on those psychotic Black women, White women, fights, etc. These can be hilariously funny topics but they just feel tired here. Hart uses the N-word way too much for my taste, but that's the price you pay for Black comedy. Pryor did it, and was hilarious and shocking. Hart uses it as both a term of endearment and a dis. Prowling the stage, Hart uses his stature for maximum comic effect (he's 5'2\"). His physicality is his biggest asset. As he throws himself around the stage with reckless abandon, one can understand why he's become such an Internet sensation. He talks fast, and has an underlying honesty that can be very effective. I like Hart, but I wasn't feeling him this time. The audience at \"Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain\" was what polite company calls \"an urban crowd.\" I'm not polite, so I'm going to call them \"a buncha loud-ass people from my 'hood.\" They talked back to the screen, which I'm used to, and their commentary was funnier than \"Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain.\" I admit to talking back to the screen once, which stunned me because I never do that. I was so frustrated by the pre-concert nonsense that I heard a familiar voice yell out \"Can we get some f#*king jokes up in here?\" My request was eventually granted, served with a heaping side of buyer's remorse. Wait for this to show up where it belongs \u2014 on cable.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Smurfs: The Lost Village", "Review": "When the brain trust at Sony Pictures Animation decided a few years ago that the Smurfs, the unremittingly chipper cartoon creations of the Belgian artist known as Peyo, were worthy of the big-screen treatment, they made the inexplicable decision to present both \u201cThe Smurfs\u201d (2011) and \u201cThe Smurfs 2\u201d (2013) as live-action/animation hybrids. The creatures were be rendered as slick CGI creations, voiced by the likes of Katy Perry, John Oliver and the late, great Jonathan Winters, and interacted with the flesh-and-blood likes of Neil Patrick Harris, Sofia Vergara and Hank Azaria. While the two films made money, they didn\u2019t exactly engender the kind of audience devotion, even among younger viewers, to warrant continuing down that same path. Therefore, when it came time for the inevitable reboot, the decision was made go for the full animation approach instead. While \u201cSmurfs: The Lost Village\u201d may not be better or more entertaining, the acknowledgment that it is aiming solely for the kiddie audience this time around at least makes it slightly more palatable than its predecessors.  Advertisement As is seemingly the case of nearly every Smurf project of note, \u201cSmurfs: The Lost Village\u201d is concerned with the existential plight of Smurfette (Demi Lovato), who is not just the only female Smurf in existence but the only one whose name doesn\u2019t serve as a handy descriptor as to their central purpose in life. Of course, this is because Smurfette is not precisely a Smurf per se as she was once a piece of clay brought to life by the fiendish Gargamel (Rainn Wilson), as part of one of his plots to snag the creatures and harness their magical powers for his own malevolent purposes. Happily, avuncular Smurf leader Papa Smurf (Mandy Patinkin ... yes, Mandy Patinkin) filled her with Smurf magic that turned her from evil to good (and which changed her from a brunette to a blonde, but never mind). One might think that not having your life story mapped out by your name would be a blessing but this nevertheless sends poor Smurfette into the depths of despair\u2014of course, being a Smurf, those depths aren\u2019t all that deep. Anyway, Smurfette has a breakthrough moment when she wanders a little too close to the wall separating the Smurf village from the Forbidden Forest. She spots what appears to be another Smurf before it disappears through the wall, leaving behind only questions and an oddly colored hat. Since she and her friends are supposedly the only Smurfs in existence, Smurfette is curious and surreptitiously sneaks out, along with friends Hefty (Joe Manganiello), Clumsy (Jack McBrayer) and Brainy (Danny Pudi), to journey into the Forbidden Forest for answers with both Papa Smurf and Gargamel in pursuit of them. After a journey that not even the most sensitive toddler would describe as \u201charrowing,\u201d they stumble upon a veritable Lost City of S where\u2014wait for it\u2014all of the Smurfs are females (with voices supplied by the likes of Ariel Winter, Meghan Trainor, Ellie Kemper and Michelle Rodriguez ... yes, Michelle Rodriguez) under the watchful eye of SmurfWillow (Juila Roberts). Although wary at first of each other, the two groups learn to work together as a team to fight off Gargamel and save their respective villages. Considering that all a film of this type has to do to be considered a success is hold the attention of a bunch of tykes for 90 minutes, \u201cSmurfs: The Lost Village\u201d sort of achieves that particular goal (there were no noticeable meltdowns in the audience that I saw it with) but doesn\u2019t really try to do much of anything else. The storyline is silly, will seem overly familiar to anyone with even the slightest past exposure to the franchise and stretches the traditional sad moment before the inevitable happy ending for so long that it may wind up upsetting some of the more sensitive young viewers who haven\u2019t grasped that it's all just a story. I must also confess to being a little disappointed by the lack of imagination on display in regards to the new tribe of Smurfs that are encountered\u2014aside from their gender (which is more of a concept in the Smurf world than anything else) and the color of their hats, there is hardly any difference between them and the more familiar ones. This will presumably prove beneficial to the makers of the merchandise, who can presumably retrofit older models into the \u201cnew\u201d characters with a minimum of time, money and effort but won\u2019t do a lot for anyone else. Advertisement That said, I must also confess that even though the film more or less made me itch as a whole, there were a couple momentary diversions. The trek through the Forbidden Forest offers up a number of cheerfully surreal visions that are genuinely striking\u2014sights such as a glow-in-the-dark bunny rabbit and plants that are essentially eyeballs on stems are rendered in wild color patterns and presented with such wild abandon that they come close to evoking the madness of such old-school animation legends as Max Fleischer and Tex Avery. I also found myself chuckling towards the end when a character is being chased by something and starts yelling out \u201cSmurfentine,\u201d in obvious homage to one of the high points of the Alan Arkin and Peter Falk classic \u201cThe In-Laws\u201d (1979).  Of course, any review of \u201cSmurfs: The Lost Village\u201d is an exercise in pure futility\u2014if you are old enough to be interested in reading a review of it, you are almost by definition too old for it and parents just want to be assured that it won\u2019t traumatize their young ones. To that end, while I cannot recommend it in good faith, I can assure parents that as a way of keeping the kids occupied for 90 minutes or so, it more or less gets the Smurf job done."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Chronic", "Review": "Tim Roth gives a career-high performance in this meticulous, disturbing film written and directed by Michel Franco. Roth is also an executive producer on the picture, having been extremely impressed by Franco\u2019s 2012 \u201cAfter Lucia.\u201d Roth plays David, a nurse who works with patients in hospice and other extreme-need situations. The film chronicles a few of his more fateful cases, and, eventually, his attempt at a rapprochement with his own family.\u00a0 His first patient is Sarah, who is dying of a wasting disease (David later tells someone that it\u2019s AIDS, but given that he\u2019s also told these people that Sarah was his wife, we aren\u2019t sure whether to believe him). In medium-distance shots, long in duration, we see David bathing her, arranging her for sleep and more. Roth is well known for playing edgy, tetchy, impetuous characters, but here he\u2019s doing the opposite: he\u2019s portraying patience, something that\u2019s probably a challenge for any actor. Roth is up for it.\u00a0 Advertisement David gets very close to his patients. Some might say creepily close. Aside from the fact that he refers to Sarah as having been his wife after she passes, when he starts working with his next patient, an embittered stroke victim named John (played by the playwright and director Michael Cristofer), he not only starts buying books on architecture to keep his patient occupied; he visits a couple of the houses that architect John has built, maintaining a pretext that he\u2019s the architect\u2019s brother. This behavior seems questionable on a surface level, but after a bit of contemplation one can extrapolate David\u2019s side of it. His telling of these provisional lies maintains not only his privacy, but also the privacy of his patient. Is it an unusual solution to the potential problem? It sure is. But it\u2019s effective.\u00a0 However, David\u2019s indulgence of John\u2014particularly his allowing his patient to use his iPad to access Internet porn\u2014lands him in a very unpleasant circumstance with John\u2019s family, and David\u2019s employers. David bristles at accusations of sexual harassment, but only briefly. Moving on, he reconnects with his immediate family. And he makes a new connection with a cancer patient who eventually requests of David an extreme solution to her dilemma.\u00a0 To give away much more than this might have the effect of diluting what discerning movie lovers will find a singular experience. Franco\u2019s style is ultra-serious and exceptionally austere. He uses no music, either within the narrative frame or outside it. He does not cut quickly, and always composes his shots with rock-solid perspective. He is unblinking in what he depicts: patients who have soiled themselves being tended to with unhurried care by David, for instance. But because Franco\u2019s views are so steady, he achieves a kind of detachment that gives the film a sense of bearing graceful witness rather than wallowing in depredation. One can imagine how a sadist such as Ulrich Seidl would handle this material, and shudder. Franco is up to something much more considered, and maybe spiritual.\u00a0 Which brings us to the matter of the movie\u2019s abrupt and disconcerting ending. It is abrupt, and disconcerting. And not, to be frank, entirely new: it draws on a device that\u2019s been kind of overused in contemporary cinema, both art house and mainstream. What\u2019s different here are the moments directly preceding it. What does David know, and when does he know it, are the questions it brings up. I was able to watch the movie in a format that allowed me to explore that further than I might have been able to in a theatrical viewing. But I\u2019m still frustrated. I am curious as to how other viewers will react.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Happening", "Review": "\"If the bee disappears from the surface of the earth, man would have no more than four years to live.\" -- Albert Einstein An alarming prospect, and all the more so because there has been a recent decline in the honeybee population. Perhaps it is comforting to know that Einstein never said any such thing -- less comforting, of course, for the bees. The quotation appears on a blackboard near the beginning of M. Night Shyamalan's \"The Happening,\" a movie that I find oddly touching. It is no doubt too thoughtful for the summer action season, but I appreciate the quietly realistic way Shyamalan finds to tell a story about the possible death of man. Advertisement One day in Central Park, people start to lose their trains of thought. They begin walking backward. They start killing themselves. This behavior spreads through Manhattan, and then all of the Northeast. Construction workers throw themselves from scaffolds. Policeman shoot themselves. The deaths are blamed on a \"terrorist attack,\" but in fact no one has the slightest clue, and New York City is evacuated. We meet Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), a Philadelphia high school science teacher; the quote was on his blackboard. We meet his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel); his friend, Julian (John Leguizamo), and Julian's daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). They find themselves fleeing on a train to Harrisburg, Pa., although people learn from their cell phones that the plague, or whatever it is, may have jumped ahead of them. Now consider how Shyamalan shows the exodus from Philadelphia. He avoids all the conventional scenes of riots in the train station, people killing Philadelphia, not New York, and shows the population as quiet and apprehensive. If you don't know what you're fleeing, how would you behave? Like this, I suspect. Julian entrusts his daughter to Elliot and Alma, and goes in search of his wife. The train stops -- permanently -- at a town. The three hitch a ride in a stranger's car, and later meet others who are fleeing, from what or to what, they do not know. Elliot meets a man who talks about a way plants have of creating hormones to kill their enemies, and he develops a half-baked theory that man may have finally delivered too many insults to the grasses and the shrubs, the flowers and the trees, and their revenge is in the wind. By now the three are trekking cross-country through Pennsylvania, joined by two young boys, who they will eventually lose. They walk on, the wind moaning ominously behind them, and come to the isolated country home of Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley), a very odd old lady. Here they eat and spend the night and other events take place, and Elliot and Alma find an opportunity to discuss their love and reveal some secrets and speculate about what dread manifestation has overtaken the world. Too uneventful for you? Not enough action? For me, Shyamalan's approach is more effective than smash-and-grab plot-mongering. His use of the landscape is disturbingly effective. The performances by Wahlberg and Deschanel bring a quiet dignity to their characters. The strangeness of starting a day in New York and ending it by hiking across a country field is underlined. Most of the other people we meet, not all, are muted and introspective. Had they been half-expecting some such \"event\" as this? Advertisement I know I have. For some time the thought has been gathering at the back of my mind that we are in the final act. We have finally insulted the planet so much that it can no longer sustain us. It is exhausted. It never occurred to me that vegetation might exterminate us. In fact, the form of the planet's revenge remains undefined in my thoughts, although I have read of rising sea levels and the ends of species. What I admire about \"The Happening\" is that its pace and substance allowed me to examine such thoughts, and to ask how I might respond to a wake-up call from nature. Shyamalan allows his characters space and time as they look within themselves. Those they meet on the way are such as they might indeed plausibly meet. Even the TV and radio news is done correctly, as convenient cliches about terrorism give way to bewilderment and apprehension. I suspect I'll be in the minority in praising this film. It will be described as empty, uneventful, meandering. But for some, it will weave a spell. It is a parable, yes, but it is also simply the story of these people and how their lives and existence have suddenly become problematic. We depend on such a superstructure to maintain us that one or two alterations could leave us stranded and wandering through a field, if we are that lucky."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Sunset Edge", "Review": "\"Sunset\u00a0Edge,\" a coming-of-age drama that's also Southern Gothic ghost story, is an unusual, ambitious failure, mostly because the film's hyper-naturalistic style is meant to evoke a supernatural mood. We watch as emotionally withdrawn teenagers communicate with each other through negligible dialogue. And their lazy summer hijinks--taking selfies, drinking sugary soda, and exploring an abandoned trailer park--seem to have been filmed entirely in natural light. Hand-held cameras follow downcast young characters as they pore over abandoned furniture, musty photographs and other left-behind debris as if the film's lead protagonists were the first people to navigate Pompeii's ruins. \"Sunset\u00a0Edge\" consequently presents its characters as adolescent sleepwalkers (though \"adolescent\" is redundant in this context). But despite its tantalizing central conceit, \"Sunset\u00a0Edge\" is executed so listlessly that its creators often strain for significance that they never fully grasp.\"Sunset\u00a0Edge\" thrives on mystery, though it's not atmospheric enough to be really mysterious. In theory, the film's nesting doll plot structure is intriguing: the first story (plot A) gets going, then pauses while the second story (plot B) catches up to where the first left off. Plot A is like a kinder slasher movie scenario. A group of teenagers haunt the ruins of\u00a0Sunset\u00a0Edge, a dilapidated trailer park. These kids are so introverted and non-threatening that the longest conversation they have is a Socratic monologue about the group's infinitely small place in the universe (apparently, they're like a grain of sand on the beach!). They then wander around a little more. Time passes. One member of the group, Haley (Haley Ann McKnight), goes missing after photographing herself by a wood-lined clothesline. Then plot B kicks in, and we meet Malachi (Gilberto Padilla), the last of\u00a0Sunset\u00a0Edge's living inhabitants.Notice how little plot there is in that plot description. \"Sunset\u00a0Edge\" is a mood piece, so much of your enjoyment of the film's events depends on your interest in exploring the film's decadent milieu. These kids solemnly tromp around unlit homes without doing any serious rummaging; they're too respectful to rummage, they're just poking around other people's homes because they're there, or something. Advertisement So these kids reverently explore the woods surrounding\u00a0Sunset\u00a0Edge, never getting too rowdy, never touching alcohol, never cursing, or horsing around too much. Then they're joined by Malachi, a mysterious stranger who remembers how fraught his home life was before\u00a0Sunset\u00a0Edge\u00a0lost its residents. Plot B is where the film's subtext--about the uniquely teenaged inability to understand death and the violent, confrontational nature of life--is most comprehensible. \"Sunset Edge\" has a secret at its heart, but it's only interesting in terms of the thematic ripples it creates in the film's eerily still narrative waters.Unfortunately, those ripples aren't strong enough to sufficiently shake up Plot A.\u00a0Malachi's story is only relatively compelling: when he interacts with his family during flashbacks, he doesn't move around like a lost wind-up toy the way that Haley and her friends do. Still, if you look at Plot B as a discreet narrative, you'll find that Malachi's sub-plot is nothing but eliptically edited flashbacks, vague dialogue, fussily mannered cinematography, and a big revelation that's actually kind of predictable. Malachi is, in other words, not that different from Haley and her companions. he walks around as if on egg-shells, and watches as his family behaves without compelling or discernible logic. They act like ghosts, and he tries to make himself scarce.\u00a0Knowing that Malachi's mood is a reflection of the tense atmosphere that surrounds\u00a0Sunset\u00a0Edge\u00a0doesn't necessarily make the existential experience of watching \"Sunset\u00a0Edge\" that much more compelling. In fact, if I were to tell you what it's like to watch \"Sunset\u00a0Edge,\" I'd tell you it's a lot of shots of tree branches swaying in the breeze, and freakishly quiet kids wandering through empty homes. Characters don't think in this film, they just absorb information so they can think about what they're looking at after the film is over. That may be true to life, but it's not exactly dramatic dynamite. More often than not, \"Sunset\u00a0Edge\" feels like a drawn-out first act for what might have been a decent movie."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "21 Years: Richard Linklater", "Review": "Matthew McConaughey stole Richard Linklater's second feature, \"Dazed and Confused,\" with his performance as the eternal high school stud Wooderson, so it makes a certain sense that he'd steal the documentary \"21 Years: Richard Linklater,\" a feature-length look at the director's movies that's disproportionately focused on \"Dazed.\" Ruminating on the Austin-based writer-director's oeuvre, McConaughey improvises monologues with an infectious grin, and uses his hands like a preacher or motivational speaker. The documentary runs 78 minutes, at least 15 minutes of which concern \"Dazed\"; the recent Oscar and Emmy winner tucks them into his back pocket like a tin of snuff. If nothing else, McConaughey's goofball autodidact's intensity certifies that there is, in fact, a \"Matthew McConaughey\" type of character, and that McConaughey originated it. Advertisement \"Boom! We go to set, I get my '70s Chevelle,\" the actor says, remembering the film's 1992 production in Austin, Texas. \"It's gonna be my first scene in the movie, and I'm going, 'Fuuuuuuck, here we go!', and I'm really nervous, I'm going, 'Who am, I what am I about, what's my man, what's my man, what's my man, what's my man,' and I remember in my head hearing Wooderson's voice going: 'All right, I'm about pot, rock 'n' roll, my car, and p----y.' Well, I'm high, I'm in my Chevelle, I'm listening to Nugent, and I heard 'action.'\" Later, in a section describing Linklater's calm, reflective demeanor, McConaughey says he once told the director, \"You're so Buddhist you don't even know you're Buddhist.\" Directed by Michael Dunaway and Tara Wood, \"21 Years\" does not cover every Linklater film, just highlights that keep popping up whenever the director's films are discussed. These include \"Dazed\"; \"Slacker\"; the experimental animated features \"Waking Life\" and \"A Scanner Darkly\"; \"School of Rock\"; \"Bernie\" and\u00a0\"The Newton Boys\" (in which McConaughey costarred); the remake of \"The Bad News Bears\"; and the \"Before\" films. The latter, a collaboration between Linklater and actor-writers Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, is described as the lowest grossing trilogy in cinema history. (That might or might not be true, but it's fun to say.) There's nothing about Linklater's secret magnum opus \"Boyhood,\" which was still under wraps during the filming of this documentary and is referred to only as \"the 12 year project.\" Delpy, Hawke, Jack Black, Keanu Reeves, Billy Bob Thornton and other Linklater performers talk about Linklater's film shoots, and try to illustrate his personality and interests; the filmmakers insist on illustrating their anecdotes with animated cutaways that feel redundant and sometimes desperate. (Surely Matthew McConaughey's charisma is enough to hold our attention for a minute or two, without \"help\"?)\u00a0 Linklater does not sit for any interviews. He is an absent presence. In one way, this is endearing: it suggests that Linklater either didn't want to seem self-aggrandizing, or didn't want to seem to be guiding anyone else's interpretations, including the viewers'.\u00a0But in another way, it hurts the film, because the other participants (mostly actors) lavish praise on Linklater without analyzing the technique or themes of his movies in much detail. The most insightful comments about Linklater as an artist, cultural observer, and community organizer come from Austin Chronicle founder Louis Black. He had a cameo in \"Slacker\" and has known Linklater for years, but\u00a0seems to have a\u00a0more detached point-of-view than the actors who've worked with the director at least once, and would presumably like\u00a0to again.\u00a0 Advertisement The 'tribute to an old pal\" structure makes \"21 Years\" feel less like a yeasty stand-alone theatrical feature than a shaggy dog supplement that might be packaged in a set of Linklater DVDs, or screened at a surprise birthday party for the filmmaker. It contains just enough analysis to interest those outside Linklater's personal circle, but not much more.\u00a0Interviewees wax eloquent about Linklater's fascination with subcultures and what it's like to work with him, paying special attention to his laid-back way of controlling and directing action, and his ability to help actors find the notes he wishes to them strike without being too obvious about it. If you admire Linklater, you'll enjoy this documentary, but an \"American Masters\" episode would still be preferable. The outtakes that run during the credits\u2014a few of which feature Thornton in absurd-profane mode\u2014are warm and funny."}

Although the 1938 version is better\r\nknown, both takes are interesting (the Hawks version allows one to see him\r\nplaying with ideas that he would come back to again throughout his career). Sadly, the similarly titled \"Dawn\r\nPatrol\" is an odious stew of murder, revenge, casual racism and overt\r\nmisogyny that is all the worse because of its apparent celebration of those\r\ningredients.  Advertisement Scott\r\nEastwood, last seen showing his pecs in \"The Longest Ride,\" stars as\r\na Marine named John. As the story opens, he is being marched across a\r\ndesert at gunpoint while telling his attacker the story of how he wound up in\r\nthis particular position. In the summer of 2008, he was an ordinary surf bum\r\ncontent to ride the waves off of Venice Beach with his brother, surfing ace Ben\r\n(Chris Brochu), and dad Trick (Jeff Fahey) while fighting off the Mexicans who\r\ndare to intrude their turf. Tensions are exacerbated when Ben's\r\nex-girlfriend, Donna (Kim Matula), takes up with Miguel (Gabriel DeSanti), and\r\nhe responds by drunkenly grabbing her away from Miguel and carting her down to\r\nthe shoreline for what begins as a sexual assault and ends with a marriage\r\nproposal, while John smacks around Miguel a couple of times in the most low-key\r\nand apologetic manner possible. Sure, this might leave you to think that Ben\r\nis a drunken jerk with rage issues but you would be wrong\u2014he just wants to\r\nsurf without having to deal with the surferazzi (yes, this is a term used in\r\nthe film) or his pothead mother (Rita Wilson) who want to exploit his talents\r\nfor money. Alas, not everyone is on his level of enlightenment\r\nbecause a couple of days later, he is found murdered on the beach. John is\r\nconvinced that Miguel is responsible for the killing\u2014he even saw the guy's car\r\nin the area just before finding the body\u2014but when the police are unable to\r\nprove it or to even come up with his last name, John's grieving parents essentially\r\ndemand that he \"man up\" and take matters into his own hands.\r\nAfter putting up what barely qualifies\r\nas token resistance, he goes about doing just that and, in news that will shock\r\nfew of you, it all goes sideways from there. \"Dawn\r\nPatrol\" is so rotten in so many ways that there is a temptation to look at\r\nit at first as some kind of demented deadpan spoof of films that celebrate\r\ngrotesque macho codes above all else, and it is only with a gradual sense of\r\nhorror that it becomes apparent that not only are we meant to take it seriously\r\nbut that it thinks that it is saying something profound. The screenplay by Rachel Long & Brian Pittman is nothing more than a bunch\r\nof stupid incidents that make little sense, lead to a pathetically obvious\r\nsurprise revelation and are presented via a flashback frame that is borderline\r\ntorturous at times without adding anything of value to the proceedings.\r\n(Suffice it to say, director Daniel Petrie Jr. fails to lend the material the\r\nsort of \u00e9lan or quiet dignity that he\r\nbrought to such previous efforts as \"Toy Soldiers\" and \"In the\r\nArmy Now.\")  Advertisement The casual racism and sexism on display is\r\noftentimes appalling, especially since the attitude it displays towards them\r\nsuggests at least a tacit endorsement. (The characterization of Donna as a\r\nvapid and frequently topless tramp who exists solely as a sexual receptacle is\r\nparticularly gruesome, all the more so considering that the screenplay was\r\nco-written by a woman.) There is not a single character in it that any sensible\r\nperson would want to spend even the slightest amount of time with and none of\r\nthe actors are able to make them into anything either. (Eastwood basically does\r\nthe same thing he did in \"The Longest Ride\"\u2014stare vacantly while\r\nshirtless\u2014and his performance is the highlight.)\u00a0 Look, if\r\nyou want to see a film that serves as a cautionary tale about how the\r\nsingle-minded desire for revenge can have unexpected repercussions for everyone\r\ninvolved and utilizes smart writing, whip-smart direction, strong performances\r\nand a nice sense of irony, I have the perfect movie for you. It is \"Wild\r\nTales,\" the jaw-dropping Argentinian black comedy consisting of several\r\nvignettes involving people trying to get the best of those who have done them\r\nwrong.

{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "S\u00e9raphine", "Review": "You might not look twice at her. Seraphine is a bulky, work-worn housecleaner who gets down on her knees in a roomy print dress and fiercely scrubs the floor. She slips away from work to steal turpentine from the church votive candles, blood from the butcher and clay from the fields, and these she combines with other elements to mix the paints she uses at night, covering panels with fruits and flowers that seem to look at us in alarm. Seraphine de Senlis, who died in a French mental institution in 1942, today has her paintings in many museums. She did not paint for money or fame, although she grew heady when they began to come her way. She painted because she was instructed to by her guardian angel. Sometimes while painting, she would loudly sing in praise of the Holy Virgin. In this miraculous film we learn nothing of her low birth or early life; we only see her daily toil and nightly ecstasy. Advertisement \"Seraphine\" arrives from France as the year's most honored film, winner of seven Cesars from the French Academy, including best film and best actress. The actress is Yolande Moreau, who combines, as some people do, a plain face with moments of beauty. Notice her fleeting little smile of complicity as she steals fuel from candles before the Virgin. Moreau plays Seraphine as a straight-ahead charger, a little stooped, marching always with energy, plunging into work, not saying much, shy, but very much who she is. Her physical bearing tells us what we need to know about her mental state. Her life is changed forever when Wilhelm Uhde (Ulrich Tukur) comes as a boarder to the home she works in; it offers a pastoral setting in Senlis, her hometown near Chantilly, and she observes that Uhde needs relief from stress. He's a famous German art critic and a Paris gallery owner, already famous as an early champion of Picasso and Braque; he discovered Rousseau. He glimpses one of Seraphine's little paintings of apples, asks to see more, is convinced she is a primitive genius. (In the film, we appear to see her actual paintings.) Seraphine observes everything, worries about Uhde, sees that he is sad, offers him some of her homemade \"power wine,\" tells him that when she is sad, she walks in the forest and touches the trees. We even see Seraphine climbing one, in her late 50s, for the view. She lives in bitter poverty, hounded by her landlady, doing laundry for a few francs, doling out her coins at the local store to buy canvas and the paints she cannot mix herself. Uhde admires her work, which she cannot believe, gives her some money, makes her some promises and then disappears: As a German, he flees France at the outset of World War I. Ten years after the war, he and his sister return to Senlis. He assumes Seraphine is dead. At a town hall exhibition by local artists, he sees a work unmistakably hers, but larger and more finished. He is overwhelmed, as many others would be. Advertisement \"Seraphine\" is not a rags-to-riches story. The director, Martin Provost, who wrote it with Marc Abdelnour, focuses intently on Seraphine's delusions, on the manic state that overtakes her at the prospect of fame and fortune, about how she hides far inside so that Uhde cannot reach her. I've seen many films hoping to understand the nature of great artists; one that comes close is \"Vincent: The Life And Death Of Vincent Van Gogh\" by Paul Cox. This is another. It \"explains\" nothing but feels everything. It reminds me of two other films: Bresson's \"Mouchette,\" about a poor girl victimized by a village, and Karen Gehre's \"Begging Naked,\" shown at Ebertfest this year, about a woman whose art is prized even as she lives in Central Park. People like these are not entirely to be pitied. Their art is a refuge. All artists fall into a reverie state while working. Some experience a joy that obliterates their circumstances. The problem is that when they're not creating, they have to go right on living."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Bessie", "Review": "HBO\u2019s \u201cBessie,\u201d premiering Saturday on the network, is a\r\nflawed drama that nonetheless warrants a look simply because of the bright\r\nspotlight it gives the underrated talents of star Queen Latifah, who does quite\r\neasily the best work of her career here. This sexually-charged, intense look at\r\nBlues icon Bessie Smith often feels defiantly episodic, as if\r\nco-writer/director Dee Rees is purposefully trying to sketch a portrait of a\r\nlife in incomplete brush strokes, but Latifah, who is in nearly every scene,\r\nnever falters in her portrayal of a woman who was too edgy, too real, and too\r\ntough to be famous before the world came crashing down around her.  Advertisement In the first full scene of \u201cBessie,\u201d the title character\r\n(Queen Latifah) is getting hot and heavy in an alley when her paramour goes a grope\r\ntoo far and starts to get violent when she refuses. She does not give in, grabbing\r\na glass shard off the pavement and stabbing her attacker, before going on stage\r\nto sing a number. Bessie takes no shit from anyone. Even those who would offer\r\nher good advice or further her career are often pushed aside by pride and ego\r\nas much as artistic integrity. Across most of \u201cBessie,\u201d we see the title\r\ncharacter confronting authority, patriarchy, the white male establishment, etc.\r\nShe is presented with an opportunity to find a broader audience but compromise\u2014she\r\nrefuses. She encounters a violent KKK sect trying to shut down a performance\u2014she\r\nmeets violence with violence. In one great moment, Langston Hughes warns her to\r\n\u201cplay\u201d to her white, snooty crowd before she heads into a party to perform. She\r\nshoots him down with a glance. Bessie Smith was a vaudeville smash in the 1920s, successful\r\nenough to have her own train on which she toured the country, and to inspire\r\nNina Simone and Billie Holliday. She rose to fame purely through talent and\r\nsheer will, but demons like addiction and the ceiling she eventually hit by\r\nrefusing to bend to the will of white producers kept her out of the spotlight,\r\nand even sunk her so low that her family was threatened. \u201cBessie\u201d hides none of\r\nSmith\u2019s demons or resilience. Reportedly in the making for 22 years from a\r\nscript by Horton Foote, it\u2019s easy to see why \u201cBessie\u201d was a film inevitability.\r\nThis is a great story of a relatively unheralded talent.  And everyone involved should be grateful that Queen Latifah\r\nagreed to take on this challenging role, one that she had reportedly been\r\ncircling for over a decade. She is powerful, fearless, and, when needed,\r\nvulnerable in a role that could easily win her an Emmy and a Golden Globe.\r\nCriticisms of \u201cBessie\u201d fall away when this performance is considered,\r\nespecially when one balances the emotional intensity of the final act with the\r\nbravado of the first two. Bessie never feels like a dramatic creation; she\r\nresonates with truth, whether it be in the longing that led her to multiple\r\naffairs (including ones with characters played by Mike Epps and Tika Sumpter),\r\nor in her downright allergic reactions to what she saw as fakeness in her profession.\r\nBlues legend Ma Rainey (Mo\u2019Nique) tells Smith early on, \u201cYou got to put something else in it. The blues is not about people\r\nknowing you, it\u2019s about you knowing people.\u201d Queen Latifah really got to\r\nknow Bessie Smith in ways that other actresses couldn\u2019t have.  Advertisement Sometimes scripts that have been around as long as \u201cBessie\u201d\r\nget over-worked, over-edited, over-analyzed to the point that they lose some of\r\nthat screenwriting \u201cmagic.\u201d The first half of \u201cBessie\u201d feels a bit too\r\ncalculated, too episodic in a way designed to give Latifah and her co-stars\r\n(including the great Michael K. Williams) the right number of big moments\r\nwithout linking them together in the arc of a life. And regular TV cinematographer Jeffrey Jur shoots too much of the film like a TV movie. It doesn't have the cinematic scope or visual language I wish it did outside of the musical numbers. As for storytelling, I found myself too often asking, especially in the first half, \"What are we supposed\r\nto take away from this story?\" Maybe nothing. Maybe we're just supposed to know more about an underrated musical icon. For that reason, \u201cBessie\u201d is best appreciated as a character/performance\r\npiece. Like you would if you went to an actual Blues concert, just enjoy the\r\nstar in the spotlight, sharing some of herself and some of the visions of her\r\nsongwriters in every note."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Frozen Ground", "Review": "Anchorage, Alaska, circa 1983, looks and feels like a pioneer town in the Wild West in \"The Frozen Ground,\" Scott Walker's new crime thriller (and first feature). It's a town teeming with strip clubs, drug addiction, prostitution, and runaway girls whom nobody would miss if they went missing. And they do go missing, in droves. Based on the true story of Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen (played here by John Cusack), and detective Glenn Flothe (named, in the film, Jack Holcombe, and played by Nicolas Cage) who, in investigating a series of missing persons reports as well as a couple of dead girls dug up by animals out in the wilderness, starts to wonder if all of these events aren't somehow connected.  Advertisement \"The Frozen Ground\" trucks in cliche, as most serial killer and police procedural films do, but the strength of the acting (from the leads down to people with only one or two lines) helps ground the film. Filmed in a frenetic style, with gigantic moving frenzied closeups, and an almost total lack of establishing shots, \"The Frozen Ground\" is best when it lands, and stays, on the faces of the leads: Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, and Vanessa Hudgens.  When we are looking at their faces, we don't need to be reminded of the stakes.  They're there in plain view. It's hard to do something new in the serial killer genre, especially since the field is so over-saturated, from the 24/7 Investigation Discovery channel to \"Criminal Minds\"'s weekly obsession with how dangerous it is to be a woman because one minute you're walking down the street, minding your own business, the next minute you're chained up in a dungeon. All of those familiar elements are here. Jack Holcombe even has a resentful wife (Radha Mitchell), complaining to her husband about how hard he works, before doing an unmotivated about-face in a later scene. Why do movies so rarely know what to do with wives of workaholics?  Why are they usually given the role of nag, before coming around in the final hour?\u00a0 But \"The Frozen Ground\" is not trying to re-invent the wheel, and it also isn't trying to imitate \"Seven\" or \"Silence of the Lambs.\" It is interested in Holcombe's increasingly urgent investigation, and the pushback he receives from higher-ups who don't want to re-open what were considered to be closed cases. There's one shot of Nicolas Cage sitting in a dark office, staring up at a bulletin board, covered with snapshots of missing women. That one shot establishes so much: his feeling of urgency, the sense of how huge this thing could be if anyone could find the missing links, and the loneliness of his quest.  Advertisement Robert Hansen's name may not be as well-known as Ted Bundy, or John Wayne Gacy, but his murderous spree in 1970s and 1980s Alaska puts him in the Serial Killer Pantheon. Despite a troubled and violent background with tons of red flags, Hansen was able to maneuver undetected in Anchorage for many years, abducting young women, raping them, taking them via private plane out into the inaccessible wilderness surrounding Anchorage and then hunting them like game. He was married, with kids.  He worked as a baker.  People liked him, but he was quiet and kept to himself. He had a great cover persona, as most of these characters do.  Flothe finally got a warrant to search Hansen's house, and found an aviation map covered with X's, to mark the spot of his burial grounds.  Many of the victims were never found.  We'll never know the number of women he actually killed.  Hansen was sentenced to 461 years in prison with no possibility of parole.  Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens) is the teenage prostitute who managed to escape from Hansen's clutches, and went to the police to tell her story.  She was not believed, because of her background.  This is handled in a manner bordering on vaudeville, with one cop regaling a group of cops with the contemptuous comment, \"I mean, how can a prostitute be raped?\" They all laugh in agreement.  This is not to say that such situations do not happen in police stations all the time, but the scene feels heavy-handed. The scenes between Nicolas Cage and Vanessa Hudgens are the film's best.  Nicolas Cage is so grounded here, so real and simple. The whole film really hinges on Holcombe trying to make Cindy trust him so that she will testify and be a reliable witness, and this is where Cage shines. His entire performance is about two things only: thinking and listening. He has a power of listening that is totally authentic, and he is quite generous to his young co-star. He is not concerned with himself, because Jack Holcombe isn't either. He listens to Cindy talk on a level that could be described as subterranean, with a cop's instinct for what isn't being said. Advertisement And Cindy is, to put it mildly, a handful. She has a pimp (played by 50 Cent, who also is one of the producers of the film), but things have gone south in that relationship. She wanders up and down the \"Ho Stroll\" in Anchorage, and gets a job dancing in a strip club. She does coke and crystal meth.  She has nowhere to live, and stands on the sidewalk in the driving snow. (There is a breathtaking scene that has nothing to do with anything else, where Cindy, alone on a deserted side street, comes across a gigantic moose, which has wandered into the city. Moose and Cindy stand for a while, staring at each other. The snow falls. It is a moment that is beyond meaning, beyond plot, reminiscent of the encounter with the deer on the railroad tracks at dawn in \"Stand By Me.\") John Cusack dials the burner down low, a smart choice, giving the character the guy-next-door persona which was so much a part of Hansen's successful M.O. When we see him in the flashbacks, with one of the girls he abducted (Gia Mantegna, in a gut-wrenching performance), he is calm, almost taciturn, even when he punches her in the head. He's almost kind and supportive with his victims, telling them they are \"good girls.\" Cusack has placed his voice at a very interesting part of his register, making him sound (and seem) benign. It's a voice that almost isn't there. He is a hunter, a predator. He has worked hard at his camouflage. Mixed in with the super fast hand-held action of the majority of the film are periodic aerial shots (Patrick Murguia is the cinematographer) of the forbidding Alaskan wilderness, mountains, glaciers, frozen rivers. These shots are constant reminders of what a vast field Hansen had to play in, and the impossibility of ever finding the missing."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Just Another Love Story", "Review": "Apart from a little nudity, \"Just Another Love Story\" could have been inspired, almost shot by shot, from a 1940s film noir from RKO, when it would have started with Robert Mitchum dying on the sidewalk in the rain. This is a vigorous thriller from Denmark that tells the classic noir story of a flawed cop trapped between a good wife and a bad woman. The twist is, the woman doesn't know she's been bad, since she has amnesia. It gets better. Jonas is a Copenhagen homicide scene photographer, happily married, with two kids. One day, his car stalls, another car slams into him, runs head on into a third car and flips into the ditch. The other driver, Julia, is critically injured. He visits her in the hospital and is greeted with joy by her family, who assumes he must be the Sebastian she told them about, the new fiance she met in Vietnam. He had to return on a later flight. Advertisement At this point, if Jonas (Anders W. Berthelsen) had seen any noirs at all, he would say: \"I don't know who Sebastian is, but my name is Jonas.\" He pauses for a fatal instant and is swept into another life. Because Julia (Rebecka Hemse) doesn't remember much and can't see well, she has no choice but to agree with her family that this is Sebastian. Her father gives him a blank check, her family embraces him, and Jonas topples into a double life. Oh, but it's more than that. Most noirs are. One thing about them is that they're rigidly moralistic. If you cheat on your wife, you're going to pay for it. This is true even if your wife knows nothing about it, the other woman can scarcely be blamed, and you start out only trying to accommodate an accident victim and her worried family. Ole Bornedal, the film's writer and director, works at a considerably quicker pace than traditional noirs, and ingeniously introduces ironies and complications I will not even hint at. The closing scenes of the plot spring one surprise after another. They seem laid on thick, but we have to admit, given all that leads up to them, they make sense. \"Just Another Love Story\" works in nice little touches. I liked Jonas' partner in photographing crime scenes, who deals with the violence and gore by laughing about it. There's a scene where a horrifying situation is described, and the guy shakes, he's chuckling so hard. Why is this shown? Well, if you photograph murder scenes, you deal with it the best you can. The whole movie flavors its plot with quirky observations and asides. It's interesting that two of the best thrillers of the last several months, \"Tell No One\" and \"Just Another Love Story,\" have come from Europe. Both movies gain because they star actors unfamiliar to us. They gain because there's room in them for close observation of the characters. They gain most of all because they don't slow down the plot for unnecessary special-effects scenes -- fights, chases, things like that. Unless such scenes are necessary or very well done, essentially they just put the plot on hold while the filmmakers flex their muscles. Here the plotting has all the muscle that's required.

They love to eat people, whom they call \"human beans,\" or simply \"beans.\" When Sophie hides from the bigger giants and they clomp around looking for her, the first thing the BFG does is find Sophie's glasses and hide them in his pocket. He does it so that the bigger giants won't see them and know for sure that he's hiding a child, but there's a more basic motivation: to prevent them from getting crushed. \"Do you have my glasses?\" she asks him late in the film, during another action scene. \"Of course,\" he says. Advertisement The movie is filled with gestures that meaningful. Like the BFG, it cares about the little things, and it moves with a grace that belies its size. It's a film about about dreaming and storytelling, parenting and childhood, nostalgia and pragmatism, and the necessity of standing up for yourself even when you know you can't win. But most of all, it's a film about two unlikely friends.  There's a little bit of plot, mostly having to do with how the BFG will deal with the really big giants who scare him and call him \"runt\"; this stuff resolves itself so quickly that it's as if the story realized it was getting late and the kids needed to get to sleep. The movie is less interested in twists and turns than in watching the giant and Sophie interact. It's the kind of film that pauses to let characters tell each other stories and that recounts a dream by throwing shadows upon a wall. There are fart jokes, but unlike most movie fart jokes, they're not crudely desperate. They're joyously strange in that Roald Dahl way, and they don't just happen when a scene needs, well, gas; the movie builds toward them patiently, the better to keep kids on the edge of their chairs waiting for that first flap-flap sound.  I can imagine a some adults finding the movie dull; \"Nothing happens,\" they'll say. \"And it's too nice.\" But I can imagine other adults loving the film for helping them\u00a0 remember what it's like to be young enough to hide from a movie monster because he's big and weird-looking and then laugh because he's kind of silly, or to want a conversation between the BFG and Sophie to go on a bit longer because the giant has a funny voice and a funnier walk (he lifts each leg as if it's heavier than it is\u2014as if he's a real giant, not a runt).  The giant keeps dreams in jars. Some are good dreams. Others are\r\n scary. The giant doesn't want Sophie to experience the scary dreams, not because there are monsters in them (though sometimes there are) but because they say hurtful things to the dreamer. The giant can be lyrical and inspiring, especially when he talks about how he loves the land and tries to listen to it. \"The funniest stories I hear are from the trees themselves,\" he tells Sophie. \"All the secret whispers of the world.\" But most other times he garbles ordinary words into malapropisms: \"Feature of habit.\" \"De-lumptious.\"\u00a0 Advertisement The movie is never too exact about its meanings; they're fluid, changing to reflect a given situation. That means the giant can be an adult who has brought a child into his \r\nworld and is scared she might die because of something he did, or failed to do. But he can also be a child who lets himself be mothered by Sophie, a kid who was forced to grow up too fast. From a distance, the shambling, silver-haired BFG often suggests a doting but scatterbrained grandfather. The \r\nbigger giants in the land of the giants stalk around like irresponsible,\r\n petty, volatile parents who have no idea how to give or accept love \r\nbecause they never learned how. (The BFG tells Sophie that giants don't \r\nhave parents.) \u00a0 Most scenes in \"The BFG\" take their time unfolding. Many consist of Sophie and the BFG talking as real friends might. Some are scored with John Williams' default \"Isn't this a marvelous adventure?\" music, which slightly dulls their sense of wonder, but others are so quiet that you can hear insects whirring and the wind moving through the grass. During action scenes, Spielberg doesn't hammer your eyeballs with fast cuts to keep you interested; he stages a lot of the conversations in long takes and keeps the camera far back, the better to allow you to appreciate the way the characters move through the frame, how they carry themselves, what they do with their hands. Close-ups are doled out sparingly, to amplify emotional moments or\u00a0 deliver the punchlines to comic ones, as when the giant eats a meal prepared by humans and Spielberg cuts to a shot of the utensils they've provided: a sword, a pitchfork and a shovel.\u00a0 Every few seconds there's an image that delights for delight's sake, such as the way the giant, sneaking out of London at night with Sophie hidden in his satchel, uses his wits and the wings of his long coat to camouflage himself: assuming the silhouetted shape of a tree; leaning back into the dark hollows of a building while covering a streetlight bulb with his hand. Spielberg and his regular cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, have an eye for bold graphic images: the giant's reflection seeming to stand upside-down on the bank of a lake he's just dived into; one of the bigger giants shielding himself against rain by hoisting up a human-sized umbrella; the BFG striding through a\u00a0 \"gate\" that marks the border of the land of giants: a zigzag rock formation, crooked like a swimmer's elbow. This is a kind-souled movie about kind souls. Sophie's glasses make it through just fine.   Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "War Story", "Review": "There\u2019s minimalist filmmaking that\u2019s quietly intriguing, and\r\nthen there\u2019s emotional detachment that\u2019s stultifying to the point of being nap-inducing. \"War Story\" falls into the latter category. Director Mark Jackson\u2019s drama is a chilly study in grief\r\nstarring Catherine Keener as a war-zone photographer shattered by her\r\nexperiences in Libya. But Jackson and co-writer Kristin Gore have structured the\r\nfilm as a mystery, so we don\u2019t really know who Keener\u2019s character is or what\r\nhappened to her until about an hour into the 90-minute running time.  Advertisement Instead, Keener\u2019s Lee smokes and sulks. She pops pills and\r\navoids calls from her editor. She holes up in the darkness of a sparse Sicilian\r\nhotel room that she insists the maid shouldn\u2019t clean. (Actually, all of her\r\ninteractions with other people are uniformly terse.) When she does leave the\r\nroom, bleary-eyed, Jackson follows her in long, Dardennes-style tracking shots\r\ndown bland hotel hallways and through cloudy city streets. There is a numbing\r\nevenness in tone to every place she goes and everything she does. Certainly, a film about a woman suffering from\r\npost-traumatic stress disorder shouldn\u2019t be a laugh riot, but it should at\r\nleast offer some glimmers of humanity to engage us and keep us hanging on. \u201cWar\r\nStory\u201d is all about withholding key information, but it\u2019s too languid to be\r\nengrossing in the first place. It takes an awfully long time to establish Lee\u2019s\r\nisolation; the first 13 minutes are essentially wordless. All kinds of choices are baffling here, beginning with the\r\nplacement of Keener in this kind of role. So much of what has made her so\r\nappealing for so long\u2014especially in her work with Spike Jonze and Nicole\r\nHolofcener\u2014is a zesty naturalism, a directness and an earthiness that allow\r\nher to make an instant connection, regardless of the character. All of that has\r\nbeen stripped away here, and what\u2019s left is a dour shell. But Lee thinks she may have found her salvation when she\r\nmeets Hafsia (Hafsia Herzi), a troubled, young refugee in need of an abortion.\r\nHafsia happens to resemble a young woman in Libya whom she photographed\r\nmourning over the body of her slain brother. In this doppelganger, Lee sees an\r\nopportunity for spiritual redemption \u2014or perhaps just a distraction from her\r\nown troubles. Their relationship is vague as is so much else in the film, but\r\neventually it seems to border on co-dependency, with the two women hiding\r\ntogether in the hotel room and even sharing the same bed, platonically. Even\r\nthe introduction of Hafsia doesn\u2019t liven things up; she\u2019s as low-key and\r\nenigmatic as Lee is. Advertisement A meeting with a longtime friend and colleague finally sheds\r\nsome light on Lee\u2019s plight. He\u2019s played by a barely-there Ben Kingsley in a\r\nmassive waste of a towering talent. Speaking of baffling decisions, Kingsley is\r\nbasically on screen for about five minutes, and when we first see him meeting\r\nup with Keener, it\u2019s from a distance at a high angle. Their discussion takes\r\nplace in a dark room in one long, extremely backlit take.  This is supposed to be one of the most significant moments\r\nin the film but because of these aesthetic choices, it just doesn\u2019t register. Kingsley\u2019s\r\nsingle scene makes you long for more of him; he\u2019s a forceful presence in a film\r\ndesperately in need of them.  Perhaps Jackson is trying to recreate for us as viewers the\r\nfoggy, drug-induced state in which Lee has placed herself as a means of\r\nprotection or denial or self-soothing. It\u2019s hard to figure it out, as is the\r\nintentionally abrupt, open-ended conclusion which feels like a slap in the face\r\nafter enduring such a slog."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "I Do... Until I Don't", "Review": "Even if \u201cI Do\u2026 Until I Don\u2019t\u201d were not the work of very promising actor/writer/director Lake Bell, it would still be a strange disappointment. Bell is just one of the notable actors here, as joined by Ed Helms, Mary Steenburgen, Paul Reiser, Amber Heard and Wyatt Cenac. It\u2019s baffling, more than anything, as to how all of this talent could create something so uncharacteristic to their collective abilities to make us laugh, or feel something.\u00a0 \u201cI Do\u2026 Until I Don\u2019t\u201d offers scenes from three different marriages. Alice (Bell) and her husband Noah (Ed Helms) run a blinds business that is in need of a boost, and not just from a good pun, which makes for a stale sequence where the couple brainstorm out loud different puns for their business. Alice is also struggling to get pregnant, which is Noah\u2019s fixation even when the power goes out at their small store.\u00a0 Advertisement Across town, an older couple, Cybil (Mary Steenburgen) and Harvey (Paul Reiser), are years into their marriage and can\u2019t believe they made it this far. Harvey gets a motorcycle in order to appease some type of crisis, while Cybil tries to reconnect with her estranged daughter, Milly (Hannah Friedman). They might be the most interesting couple in the story, even if their beats are familiar.\u00a0 The couple written with weakest writing are the young hippies Fanny (Amber Heard) and Zander (Wyatt Cenac). Their problem, if it can be considered that, concerns the fragile bond of their polyamorous ways (which we soon learn are more complicated). They mostly serve to offer the movie cheap hippie jokes about them not understanding personal space, or that they haven't even told their young son that TVs exist.\u00a0 True to the unimaginative way in which this movie visually tells its story, these subjects become the focus of a documentary by BBC talent Vivian Prudeck (Dolly Wells), a hammy, snooty woman who seeks to prove her thesis that marriage is a sham. Instead, she pitches her film subjects on the idea that marriage should be treated like seven-year contract, and renewed if so desired. This idea isn\u2019t followed through so much in the documentary that Vivian does make with her subjects, but it soon becomes apparent that she will do anything to get footage to prove her point. Aside from making her a tiresome idea of a phony intellectual, she becomes an easy villain, while pushing the couples to the bullet points this movie treats like epiphanies: Relationships are hard; communication can save relationships; love is the answer, etc.\u00a0 There is a baffling lack of originality to the story that always arises. It starts with Vivian\u2019s English accent doing a voiceover about how love and marriage are not sustainable, which is revealed to be a lecture that Alice is attending. Large jokes then include easy targets like Fanny and Zander\u2019s hippy existence, or a massage parlor that emphasizes on happy endings. The framing device of a documentary about relationships proves not just common as well but underutilized, with most of the marital strife taking place where Vivian is not filming. There\u2019s even a baby about to pop in the finale. It\u2019s ideas like this thrown into the story, along with the group\u2019s idea to later get revenge on the marriage cynic, that show how this movie merely wants to be liked while struggling to have personality.\u00a0 Advertisement As well, there\u2019s a strange slightness that comes with its rough draft construction. It\u2019s a movie that\u2019s working through something, as with its portrayals of different relationships that are challenged by communication (spouses, mothers, sisters, friends). But the stakes are rendered low from the start concerning the lifespan of the couples, even with Bell\u2019s game cast trying to sell different depictions of marital strife. Resolutions seem to come rather quickly, with little more than the script\u2019s nice gesture to show lovers resolve their differences.\u00a0 There's little to take away from this film, aside from the anamorphic view of Long Beach, where bright sunny days contrast a desaturated look with some Woody Allen free flow. And as Bell seems to own clich\u00e9s more than challenge them, or let comic jokes lay flat, \u201cI Do\u2026 Until I Don\u2019t\u201d marks a strange turn from the characteristic creativity of her previous efforts. It isn\u2019t as painful as breaking up, but it gets close."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Miracle Season", "Review": "One of the most immediately noteworthy things about this movie is how clean everybody and everything in it is. \u201cThe Miracle Season\u201d opens with voiceover from Kelly (Erin Moriarty), telling the audience about how amazing it is to find a friend who makes you believe you can fly. Kelly and said friend, Caroline (Danika Yarosh) are seen as little girls and then teens, goofing around in a slightly converted barn that has nary a dust mote floating in it. Soon we\u2019re tooling around with teens Kelly and \u201cLine\u201d (that\u2019s Caroline\u2019s nickname) in a spotless sea-blue convertible; the girls are dressed in immaculate jerseys and shorts; they park outside a bakery and even the early autumn leaves on the sidewalk look as if they\u2019ve been freshly rinsed and meticulously placed. Stars Hollow looks like a neighborhood from a particularly grungy \u201cLaw and Order: SVU\u201d episode by comparison. And West High School, where the girls play volleyball, makes the high school in \u201cLove, Simon\u201d look like the one from \u201cThe Blackboard Jungle.\u201d Advertisement Caroline and Kelly themselves are similarly well-scrubbed. Line is very lively but wholesome; her mischievous streak is never malicious but aims to push her friends to do things they might never have tried. As when she pushed Kelly to invite a handsome new neighbor to the season kickoff party at the dust-free barn Line\u2019s dad owns, or when she impulsively challenges her teammates to partake in a pizza-eating contest, which move doesn\u2019t sit well with her no-nonsense volleyball coach, Kathy Bresnahan, played by Helen Hunt. Coach Bresnahan is particularly irked because her team was the state champion of 2010, and \u201cBres,\u201d as her charges call her, doesn\u2019t want that to be a fluke.    The reason the movie\u2019s set in 2010 is because it\u2019s based on a true story, and the true story gets rolling with a tragedy: Caroline\u2019s death in a driving accident just as the season\u2019s getting underway. The movie\u2019s particular cushy sheen, engineered by director Sean McNamara, means that of course the accident is not depicted. But Caroline\u2019s character has been well enough embodied by Yarosh\u2019s performance that the loss registers, and the devastation of her teammates, not to mention her surgeon father, played by William Hurt, is felt.    To a certain extent. Given the title, you know that this movie is not selling suspense but inspiration. The dispirited team can\u2019t shake off the loss at first, but thanks to an example reluctantly set by Kelly, it starts to find its footing again. The determination to win \u201cfor Line\u201d pushes everyone, until the coach asks the near-impossible: that the team clear the board and get to the quarter-finals by taking fourteen games in a row.    I imagine it\u2019s hard to simulate volleyball games, and I don\u2019t have to imagine in order to remark that they are difficult to make exciting on film. So this movie goes for the heartstrings and tear ducts more than the sports-conscious. The results are pretty mixed. God bless William Hurt. The script gives him every excuse to phone in the part of Caroline\u2019s father by obliging him to speak lines like \u201cI may be the surgeon, but you\u2019re the hero out there.\u201d Despite that, he\u2019s straight and genuine throughout. As is Hunt, whose character\u2019s emotionally shut-down fa\u00e7ade gives way in a powerful scene near the end.    Problem is, every time the movie gets near an authentic emotion, it barely pauses before making a run to the next Katy Perry song cue. (Seriously, both \u201cRoar\u201d and \u201cFirework\u201d are featured herein.) Given the care that the adult and teen actors invested in trying to honor their real-life counterparts, this feels lazy. If you like Katy Perry songs that much, you may feel differently.\u00a0  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Possession", "Review": "\"The Possession\" is a serious horror film about supernatural possession that depends on more than loud noises to scare us. Like \"The Exorcist,\" the best film in the genre, it is inspired by some degree of religious scholarship and creates believable characters in a real world. That religions take demonic possessions seriously makes them more fun for us, the unpossessed. The possession of the title is an actual object, a dark wood box, ingeniously locked shut. It has a carved inscription in Hebrew informing the finder that the box entraps a dybbuk, an evil spirit that will cleave to the soul of anyone unlucky enough to release it. Dybbuks are a familiar element in Jewish folklore.\u00a0 Advertisement After a startling opening sequence in \"The Possession,\" the box turns up in what is actually a likely place, a yard sale. It is purchased by a young girl named Emily (Natasha Calis), who lives with her sister, Hannah (Madison Davenport), and their father, Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), after his divorce from the girls' mother, Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick). All of this unfolds as a plausible narrative and doesn't depend on a young girl's hysteria or tragedy between her parents (that comes later). It is just as it's billed: A dybbuk box, inspired in fact by an actual box described in a well-known article published in the Los Angeles Times. Whether the real box caused the phenomena on display in the film I somehow doubt, but I don't want to open it in order to find out. The father and two girls have just moved into a new suburban house, one of those places with fresh paint and empty rooms; its very sterility makes a contrast with the Old World gloom of a dybbuk. After opening the box, Emily begins to act strangely, becomes fiercely possessive about the box, disturbs her father and teachers, and inspires her mother to suspect and mistrust her ex-husband. Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan play the couple with firm realism and without showy histrionics. One of the scariest things about \"The Possession\" is that the characters are all real before Emily begins to change. The film, directed by Ole Bornedal, makes the contents of the box macabre without going nuts with special effects. There's also a small container holding a curious mechanical insectoid object, various other obscure artifacts, and somehow most frightening of all \u2014 moths, lots of moths. Moths in a box sealed for centuries are far more sinister than CGI dragons and suchlike. In a fascinating second act, Clyde consults a Jewish professor at the school where he coaches basketball, learns the translation of the words carved on the box and seeks help from a community of Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn. A group of old men in a synagogue fearfully puts distance between themselves and the box. But the rabbi's younger son, Tzadok (Matisyahu), believes it's his duty to help when a life is in danger, and this leads to a frightening attempt at exorcism. Advertisement Matisyahu makes a sympathetic exorcist. I looked him up. He bills himself as the Hasidic Reggae Superstar. Apparently in real life he has some problems with dybbuks. But he's effective here, as an earnest young man who sings along with his iPod but has also absorbed much theological lore from his father. The scene where he goes mano a mano with the dybbuk will remind lots of people of Max von Sydow's face to face with a demon in \"The Exorcist.\" Comparisons can be made with Linda Blair's suffering in that film, and Natasha Calis' tortured performance here. Fair enough. \"The Exorcist\" has influenced a lot of films, and this is one of the better ones."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Once Upon a Time in Venice", "Review": "After decades of kicking ass and taking names as one of America's foremost action stars, it's somewhat easy to forget that Bruce Willis began his career as a comic actor. Before \"Die Hard,\" there was \"Moonlighting,\" where Willis, alongside Cybill Shepherd, perfected casual, barbed banter as well as his sly wit. He still employs the latter in many of his features, usually in one-liners in between shootouts, but it's rare that a film asks him to prioritize his comedic talents over his considerable action prowess. Advertisement The best thing that can be said about \"Once Upon a Time in Venice,\" a very light action comedy from Mark and Robb Cullen, is that it allows Willis to cut loose and have fun. He plays Steve Ford, a private eye in Venice Beach who appears to mostly just skateboard, sleep around, talk shop with his recently-divorced, mildly depressed best friend Dave (John Goodman, also cutting loose and having fun), and occasionally solve minor mysteries. The film mostly consists of two-hander scenes where Willis gets to crack wise with various character actors, and generally be a likable screen presence. It's genuinely nice to see him work in that mode. But though Willis, Goodman, and roughly half of the large supporting cast (which includes Thomas Middleditch, Adam Goldberg, Wood Harris, and Kal Penn, just to name a few) acquit themselves well, \"Once Upon a Time in Venice\" largely suffers from profound laziness. Its bare bones plot isn't the issue (Willis' beloved pup has been stolen by Jason Momoa and his drug gang) since it mostly strives for an ambling, shaggy dog tone, but it has no rhythm. It awkwardly shuffles along from scene to scene while introducing various inane plot points that abruptly conclude before they're developed. There are plenty of thinly-sketched characters whom the film discards or forgets at will until they're suddenly necessary for any given scene. It's amiable and pleasant, but never exactly funny. It features a completely unnecessary, wholly smug voiceover, courtesy of Middleditch. Plus, for a 90-minute film, there's way too much padding to speak of, especially in the first \"act,\" if you can call it that.\u00a0 The Cullens clearly wanted to tell a character-based story starring Willis as a lax private dick who acts his shoe size rather than his age, and to their mild credit, they have all the material for that kind of feature. Willis fits the part well and they pepper the film with enough incident to both keep the story afloat and allow a threaded character study. Unfortunately, the Cullens deal primarily in the superficial, which all but negates this effort. They do the bare minimum to ground Willis' character in reality without going through the effort to give him much characterization, let alone depth. They hint at some backstory (he's a disgraced cop and there's suggestion of a troubled past home life), but they mostly want to ignore the work of development and skip right over to the fun stuff. In other words, this ain't \"The Long Goodbye.\" Advertisement To be clear, there's nothing wrong with \"Once Upon a Time in Venice\" prioritizing \"fun\" over things like plot or character. The problem arises when the film relies on performances to carry that torch and then provides its cast nothing in the way of support. \"Once Upon a Time in Venice\" frequently sags underneath its own general lethargy, and not even the snarkiest John McClane can fix that. It's a shame, too, because whenever Willis and Goodman are on screen together, you can see glimpses of what \"Once Upon a Time in Venice\" could've been with just a little more discipline."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Doc & Darryl", "Review": "\u201cThere\u2019s a real me without the uniform.\u201d\r\n\u2014Darryl Strawberry In 1983, Darryl Strawberry won the Rookie of the Year for\r\nthe amazing season he had with the New York Mets. In 1984, Dwight \u201cDoc\u201d Gooden\r\njoined the same team and won the same award after a ridiculous year that\r\nincluded 17 wins and over 275 strikeouts. The next year, Gooden won the Cy\r\nYoung and the team won the World Series in 1986. These weren\u2019t average baseball\r\nplayers. They were icons. They were demigods. They were prepared to redefine\r\nthe sport, dominating for a decade or more on their way to the Hall of Fame. They\r\nwere also addicts, two men who fought battles against drug and alcohol\r\naddiction in a city and an era that downright encouraged it. Co-directors Judd\r\nApatow and Michael Bonfiglio united the pair again in a Queens diner for their\r\nepisode of ESPN\u2019s excellent sports documentary series \u201c30 for 30\u201d called \u201cDoc\r\n& Darryl,\u201d airing this Thursday, 8pm CST. The two reminisce a bit, but more is\r\nrevealed in one-on-one interviews with the men that focus on the real people inside the uniforms more than the fame they earned on the baseball diamond. Advertisement Darryl Strawberry came from an incredibly dark background in\r\nLos Angeles, where his father abused him on a regular basis and even threatened\r\nhis family with a shotgun. He had what he calls \u201cscars\u201d coming into the league,\r\nwhen he was the #1 pick for the New York Mets. He also had one of the most\r\nbeautiful and seemingly effortless swings that the sport has ever seen. But he\r\nbrought the lessons of an alcoholic father to New York in the mid-\u201880s, a city\r\ndefined by excess. To handle the pressure of being the #1 pick, Strawberry\r\nstarted getting high every day. And he\u2019d go out partying every night, even\r\nclaiming he once hit two home runs with a blinding hangover. And then he\r\ndiscovered cocaine. Joining Strawberry on this crazy train was the similarly preternaturally\r\ngifted Doc Gooden, a man who also had a background of addiction and pressure.\r\nHis father wasn\u2019t abusive, but he was an alcoholic, and Gooden speaks even\r\ntoday of the pressure in not letting down his own man when he started playing\r\nball. Gooden had an arm like a whip, able to pinpoint a fastball in a way that seemed literally unfair. I speak from experience here, becoming a huge baseball\r\nfan in the early to mid-\u201880s. I was a huge\r\nDoc Gooden fan. Like some of the interview subjects in \u201cDoc & Darryl\u201d\r\n(including superfan Jon Stewart, manager Davey Johnson, Tom Verducci, and\r\nco-Met Keith Hernandez) say, Gooden felt like a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d pitcher.\r\nAnd then he discovered cocaine. For a time, Doc & Darryl were highly functioning\r\naddicts. In fact, both men speak of the legendary \u201986 Mets as a team of\r\njunkies, men who would pop amphetamines on their way out to the field so they could\r\nperform better. They were called \u201cgreenies,\u201d and if you didn\u2019t take them it was\r\nperceived that you weren\u2019t trying hard enough. Two very young men in Gooden and\r\nStrawberry ended up on a team that would make them stars, but one also has to\r\nwonder if the speed and aggression of New York didn\u2019t feed their addiction. Would\r\nthey have turned out the same in Seattle?  Advertisement Perhaps they would have, because \u201cDoc & Darryl\u201d is careful not to place\r\nblame on anyone but the two men in its title and their addictions. At a few\r\npoints, Apatow & Bonfiglio almost move too quickly, especially when it\r\ncomes to a rape charge (that Gooden denies) and domestic abuse (that Strawberry\r\ndoes not). And there are some scary chapters that the whole production seems to\r\nzip through, including a suicide attempt by Gooden and a fascinating concept,\r\nnot really suggested until the end by Bob Forrest of \u201cCelebrity Rehab\u201d (on\r\nwhich Gooden appeared) that fame allows men like Gooden and Strawberry to never\r\nhave a rock bottom. Gooden will always be recognized and always be cheered, even in the darkest pits of his addiction. For\r\nthe record, Strawberry seems honestly happy and open (he admits things like \u201cI\r\nhurt a lot of people\u201d), having turned his pain into a life with the church and\r\nfounding the Darryl Strawberry Recovery Center in Florida. Gooden seems to still struggle,\r\nmaking headlines for relapses as recently as last year, and he comes across\r\nnervous through a lot of the film\u2014a good man still fighting the fight. Michael Bonfiglio did the excellent 2012 chapter of \"30 for 30\" on Bo Jackson, so he knows a thing or two about larger-than-life sports personalities, but why Judd Apatow? Well, he\u2019s a New York Mets fan, but there\u2019s\r\nalso an interesting line to be drawn if one considers the theme of most of his\r\nfilms\u2014men trying to define themselves as lovers (\u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d),\r\nfathers (\u201cKnocked Up\u201d), husbands (\u201cThis is 40\u201d), etc. One can\u2019t be a\r\nprofessional athlete and an addict forever, and that\u2019s a lesson that Darryl\r\nStrawberry and Doc Gooden learned the hard way, falling from pedestals on which\r\nso many of us placed them. And they're still trying to exactly figure out their place in life and sports history.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much history between these two that just\r\nseeing them sit across from each other at a diner should be enough for most\r\nbaseball fans old enough to remember when the Mets ruled the sports world (and I wanted a bit more of the actual diner conversation, to be honest). That\r\nthe film about them becomes more about human frailty, regret, and\u2014eventually\u2014hope for the future, speaks to its excellence."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Gangster Squad", "Review": "You may have noticed that the trailers for \"Gangster Squad\" are peppered with hyperbolic review quotes provided by syndicated critics of dubious merit. They're a sure sign of a movie's mediocrity, and my favorite blurb hypes \"Gangster Squad\" as \"the best gangster film of the decade!!\" Man, what a drag. If that's true, the next seven years are going to be lousy for the world's favorite crime genre. To be fair, this tawdry dose of pulp fiction (\"inspired by real events\") is not a complete waste of time. It offers the marginal pleasure of an all-star cast slumming their way through a thicket of routine plotting, almost laughable dialogue and the constant blaze of tommy guns. The latter also resulted in a postponed release: A scene involving machine guns in a movie theater was cut after last year's tragic \"The Dark Knight Rises\" multiplex killings in Aurora, Colorado, and other scenes were rewritten and re-shot to fill gaps in the narrative. Advertisement Not that it mattered much. No amount of tinkering could repair the film's tonal inconsistencies. A comedy specialist stepping into semi-dramatic territory, director Ruben Fleischer scored a modest hit with 2009's giddy, satirical \"Zombieland\" (he is currently filming a sequel), and delivered plenty of laughs on TV, directing segments of HBO's \"Funny or Die Presents\" and working with Jimmy Kimmel, Zach Galifianakis, Michael Cera and Will Ferrell, among others. In \"Gangster Squad,\" however, Fleischer seems out of his element. His film has the familiar look and feel of a gangster classic, with plenty of dark, burnished hardwoods, shiny vintage cars and meticulous attention to period details of costume, architecture and interior design. Cinematographer Dion Beebe, who earned an Oscar for his work on \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" (and was nominated for \"Chicago\"), bathes \"Gangster Squad\" in a rich palette of smoky shadows and dazzling night-life opulence. Yet for all the production's post-war gloss and moody atmosphere, you still get the sense that Fleischer is barely suppressing an urge to spoof the genre. It's late 1949, and as the holidays approach, former-boxer-turned-Chicago-mobster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) has expanded Meyer Lansky's Jewish mafia to Los Angeles, where's he's planning to monopolize drugs and gambling and squeeze his bosses out of the equation. He means business, too: As the movie opens, Cohen sends a message to Chicago by chaining one of Lansky's soldiers between two revving sedans and pulling him apart like a bloody croissant. Early on, there's still hope that \"Gangster Squad\" might at least aspire to the crackling volatility of \"L.A. Confidential,\" the brash brutality of \"Mulholland Falls,\" the verbal and visual eloquence of \"Miller's Crossing\" or the classy opulence of Barry Levinson's \"Bugsy\" (partially set in nearly the the same place and time, and featuring Harvey Keitel as Cohen). That's just wishful thinking. If anything, \"Gangster Squad\" is an \"Untouchables\" wanna-be, as Irish LAPD sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is given carte blanche orders by incorruptible LAPD Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) to recruit an off-the-books squad of crimefighters to topple Cohen's empire without the benefit of a David Mamet screenplay. It's all good fun at first, even when it's obvious that each of these stock characters is introduced with a single attribute that shallowly defines them for the rest of the movie. O'Mara is a no-nonsense strategist with a punishing right hook and a supportive, pregnant wife (Mireille Enos, from AMC's \"The Killing\") waiting for him at home. Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) is a ladies' man who's reluctant to get involved until he meets Cohen's red-dressed moll Grace (Emma Stone), who wonders \"where've you been all my miserable life?\" \u2013- a line Stone nearly chokes on as her chemistry with Gosling in \"Crazy Stupid Love\" curdles into lukewarm mush. Advertisement Grizzled officer Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) is a legendary sharpshooter; his young Mexican partner Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pe\u00f1a) drives a mean chase car; and officer Conway Keller (Giovanni Ribisi) is an expert in post-war surveillance -- a techie version of Charles Martin Smith's ill-fated accountant from \"The Untouchables.\" Each of them gets a moment to shine, usually accompanied by a crowd-pleasing quip or throwaway sight gag. Those scenes benefit from Fleischer's comedic sensibility, but whenever \"Gangster Squad\" gets down to the serious business of cutthroats and killers, its jarring shifts from light humor to heavy bloodshed reflect the movie's tonal identity crisis. We're ultimately left with a few action highlights (including a technically impressive car chase) and some dazzling recreations of vintage Hollywood landmarks, including Slapsy Maxie's nightclub (a frequent Cohen hangout) and the infamous Garden of Allah apartment complex. We're also treated to occasional (muzzle-) flashes of brilliance from Penn. His Cohen is like a corked-up volcano, always on the verge of eruption. At one point, Cohen grows so murderously vile that evil has contorted his visage. Penn, at 52, has acquired facial cracks and crevices that deepen his formidable presence, and his already heavy eyelids look like they're almost melting over Cohen's cold, unforgiving gaze. So while the cast has a field day, Fleischer seems content to equate flashiness with quality, employing such visual tricks as variable slow-motion when bullets and bodies are flying, and digital wizardry designed to give explosions and other pyrotechnics a dynamic, almost three-dimensional life of their own. And while the ultra-slow-mo image of a Christmas tree ornament shattering in a hail of bullets may look pretty cool for a few seconds, it's merely a brief distraction from the shortcomings of Will Beall's screenplay, adapted (loosely, we can assume) from the book of the same title by Paul Leiberman. Beall's script reaches its nadir, oddly enough, with Brolin's closing narration, which is so sentimentally sappy that it deservedly drew groans from a preview audience. By the time it fades to black, \"Gangster Squad\" has squandered most of its early promise. Here's a telling comparison: I recently happened upon a showing of \"Mobsters,\" the Christian Slater vehicle that's been a cable-TV staple since its release in 1991. Packed with B- and C-list costars like Richard Greico and Costas Mandylor, it's still a marginally better film than \"Gangster Squad,\" and that's faint praise indeed. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Casual Vacancy", "Review": "Youth may be rebellious but adulthood can be repellent.\r\nMaturity certainly fails to equal responsibility or morality in HBO\u2019s\r\nmini-series \u201cThe Casual Vacancy,\u201d premiering tomorrow night, April 29th,\r\n2015, and finishing up the next night. It\u2019s an import from the BBC adaptation\r\nof J.K. Rowling\u2019s first non-\u201cHarry Potter\u201d novel that sometimes threatens to\r\ndrift away on its own casual tone, but raises enough interesting conversation\r\npoints about the potential for the avarice of government to supersede the\r\npurpose of it that it\u2019s worth a look. Every element that doesn\u2019t quite work in \u201cThe\r\nCasual Vacancy\u201d is offset by a legitimate reason to check it out, at least\r\nuntil the muddled ending. This may not be on the level of HBO\u2019s striking \u201cOlive\r\nKitteridge\u201d, but few things are. Advertisement Like \u201cOlive\u201d, \u201cThe Casual Vacancy\u201d starts off feeling like a\r\ncharacter piece more than a morality tale (and ends up too much like the\r\nlatter). A quant English burg named Pagford is in the middle of a class and age\r\nwar. Graffiti has been popping up around town, usually of the sexually explicit\r\nnature, and there\u2019s a growing drug problem. Barry Fairbrother (Rory Kinnear,\r\nwho recently appeared in \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d) is a more forward-thinking,\r\nbenevolent councilman, the kind who advocates for welfare and even takes\r\ntroubled people under his wing for advice, including Krystal (Abigal Lawrie).\r\nBarry seems to be single-handedly swinging the vote against the more\r\nconservative faction of the city council, led with satirical glee by Michael\r\nGambon and Julia McKenzie. And then poor Barry has an aneurysm.  The title \u201cThe Casual Vacancy\u201d refers to the council seat\r\nthat needs filling on a textual level, but also has deeper meaning. It is\r\nreferenced in a dream sequence as referring to a grave\u2014something that\u2019s not\r\nempty for long after its creation\u2014and carries over into how much people can be\r\nabsent from each other\u2019s lives, whether it be an abusive father or a junkie\r\nmother. Few vacancies are actually casual in this world. They\u2019re just perceived\r\nas such.  The mad scramble to fill Barry\u2019s seat leads to an upheaval\r\nin Pagford. Three nearly worthless candidates\u2014one maniac and two milquetoasts\u2014come\r\nforward for the job, but Rowling is more interested in how death and the\r\nprocess of government impacts those run by it. I have not read Rowling\u2019s book,\r\nbut it is apparently much more tragic than Sarah Phelps\u2019 adaptation. The\r\nscreenwriter has pulled back on some of Rowling\u2019s darker, more deeply cynical\r\ntones, resulting in a mini-series that sometimes lacks the urgency that it\r\nmight have had on the page. It\u2019s the kind of character-driven dramedy that\r\noften works better on the page than it does in film. \u201cOlive Kitteridge\u201d\r\novercame this by giving us such a strong, vital, central character. There\u2019s not\r\nreally one of those here as Barry himself, who \u201creturns\u201d when a blog reveals\r\neveryone\u2019s secrets under the guide of \u201cThe Ghost of Barry Fairbrother\u201d, casts\r\nthe longest shadow in Pagford. \u201cThe Casual Vacancy\u201d gains most of its value from a striking\r\ndebut performance by Lawrie as Krystal, a character introduced wearing such an\r\ninappropriate outfit to her school that it makes the headmaster cry. Krystal\u2019s\r\nmother is a junkie and she knows she\u2019s basically seen as little more than an\r\nobject of desire for her male classmates, but Lawrie doesn\u2019t play her as a\r\ntragic case. She finds the energy underneath the character in a way that\r\nreminded me of Katie Jarvis\u2019 amazing performance in Andrea Arnold\u2019s \u201cFish Tank\u201d. She's really one to watch. Advertisement There\u2019s something thematically engaging about how the death\r\nof a good man makes other people either try to find the goodness within themselves\r\nor reveals the lack thereof. And the influence of good deeds linger past death,\r\nand often increase as we remember key moments from those who are no longer with\r\nus and place greater importance on them. I became increasingly interested in\r\nhow these themes would play out in \u201cThe Casual Vacancy,\u201d and then Phelps misses\r\nthe target widely in the final scenes, adjusting the ending of the book in a\r\nway that just doesn\u2019t seem right here. (Although I\u2019m not sure the book\u2019s ending\r\nwould have been earned by the tone of this adaptation either.) We can\u2019t avoid death or government, even in small-town\r\nEngland. They are inevitabilities and the best parts of \u201cThe Casual Vacancy\u201d\r\nreveal how they intertwine into everyday life in ways we may not fully\r\nunderstand until we gain the clear vision of hindsight."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Man in the Chair", "Review": "\"The Man in the Chair\" is a movie about a high school student who enlists two movie industry veterans from old folks' homes to help him with his project. And I mean old folks. Flash Madden (Christopher Plummer) claims to have been given his nickname by Orson Welles on the set of \"Citizen Kane,\" which means, if he was 25 at the time, he is 91 now. And Mickey Hopkins (M. Emmet Walsh), a writer, claims to have written \"Queen Christina,\" which, if he was 25 at the time, would make him 99. Of course we know that Mickey didn't write \"Queen Christina\" (or \"Gone With the Wind,\" another one of his \"credits\"), and the odds are against Flash's story, too. The chances are that they are both lying, but the kid, Cameron (Michael Angarano), doesn't think of that, and neither does the writer-director, Michael Schroeder, although it might have made this a better movie. Advertisement What it is, instead, is a half-baked idea for a movie with way too many characters and subplots. Do we really need another lovable cheering section of characters (and character actors) who live at the Motion Picture Home and have individual headlined character traits? Do we need animal haters who catch and kill dogs as a business? Do we need the kid to have a mean father? Do we need him to have a competitor who bullies him at school? Do we need for old Flash to be such an alcoholic that to still be drinking like that at 91 must mean he only started at 90? The movie works so hard at juggling its cliches that it fails to generate interest in its story -- which turns out to be not the skateboarding drama the kid had in mind but a docudrama Flash sells him on about the mistreatment of old folks like Mickey. Then the animal subplot takes over as the old folks and the kid attack the cruel dog pound, uh-huh. And there is a stunt involving gasoline that is way too far over the top. Christopher Plummer is a superb actor. I applauded him Off-Broadway as the best Iago I have ever seen. No doubt there were aspects of the idea of this character that appealed to him, but did he measure its probability? And as for Mickey, M. Emmet Walsh, also a great character actor, has made a living looking moth-eaten and ramshackle, but good Lord, what they do to Mickey in this picture, it's a mercy his poor mother isn't alive to see it (if she were 25 when she had Mickey, she'd be 124 now). I know an old writer. His name is William Froug, he lives in Florida, and if you look him up on Amazon, you will see he is still writing brilliant and useful books about screenwriting and teleplays. He is not merely as sharp as a tack, he is the standard by which they sharpen tacks. If he had been advising the kid, the kid would have made a better movie, and if he had been advising the director of \"The Man in the Chair,\" we would have been spared the current experience. Just because you're old doesn't mean you have to be a decrepit caricature. One thing that keeps Froug young is that, unlike Flash Madden, he almost certainly does not sit on an expressway overpass guzzling Jack Daniels from a pint bottle. Copy-reading note: If flashbacks are meant to recall reality, it is unlikely that the slate on \"Citizen Kane\" would have misspelled the name of Orson Welles.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Repo Men", "Review": "\"Repo Men\" makes sci-fi's strongest possible case for universal health care. In a world of the near future, where they still drive current cars, a giant corporation named the Union will provide you with a human heart, kidney, liver or other organ. Let's say a pancreas costs you, oh, say $312,000. No, it's not covered by insurance, but the sales guy says, \"You owe it to yourself and your family.\" For a guy in need of a pancreas, this is an eloquent argument. Interest rates are around 19 percent. Now let's say you can't make the payments. If you fall behind more than three months, they send around a Repo Man who shoots you with a stun gun, slices open your body, reaches in and repossesses the organ. To be sure, he puts on latex gloves first. I don't believe the gun kills you, but after they leave you on the floor with an organ missing, your prognosis is poor. Advertisement Let's say you were conscious during such a procedure. Would it hurt? You bet. At one point in the film, our heroes Remy and Beth (Jude Law and Alice Braga) decide the only way to outwit the company's computer is to repossess themselves. He has a donor heart, and as for Beth, her heart is her own, but is surrounded by guest organs. They don't actually carve themselves open and remove the organs. No, that would be fatal. But they have to reach inside each other with a bar-code scanner and scan them in. As Remy carves into his chest with a big old knife, you oughta see the way his fist clenches and how he grits his teeth. He's thinking, I wish I had the public option. I don't know if the makers of this film intended it as a comedy. A preview audience regarded it with polite silence, and left the theater in an orderly fashion. There are chases and shootouts, of course, and a standard overwrought thriller soundtrack, with the percussion guy hammering on cymbals and a big bass drum. Even then, you wonder. Remy and Beth find themselves locked in a corridor with a dozen guys from the evil corporation, who are well armed. They dodge the bullets and wham some guys with karate, and then Remy pauses, strips off his shirt, reveals his bare (pre-repo) chest and is wearing kinky leather pants with buckles. From scabbards in the back, he withdraws two long knives that help explain why he wasn't seated earlier in the scene. He slices some other guys. Then he shouts \"hacksaw!\" to Beth, and she slides it to him on the floor, and he whirls around and decapitates three guys, it looked like, although it happened real fast. What are people supposed to think? Is this an action scene, or satire? Does it make any difference? I dunno. I know the actors play everything with deep, earnest seriousness. The head of the Union corporation is Frank (Liev Schreiber), who demands complete dedication from his repo men and is humorously not humorous. Maybe he's not the head of the whole Union, but only their immediate boss. The Union's headquarters building is maybe 100 stories high, and Remy stumbles into a room with guys in white suits working at tables that stretch farther than a football field. There are enough props in this movie to clean out the Organ Department at Moo & Oink's. When I say they're up to their elbows in blood, I mean it. This work takes its toll. Remy's friend at work is a repo man named Jake, played by Forest Whitaker. Like most Forest Whitaker characters and Whitaker himself, he is a warm, nice man. I noticed for the second time in a week (after \"Our Family Wedding\") that Whitaker has lost a lot of weight and looks great. I hope the extra pounds weren't repo'ed. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "I'm Still Here", "Review": "A mind is a terrible thing to waste. The tragedy of Joaquin Phoenix's self-destruction has been made into \"I'm Still Here,\" a sad and painful documentary that serves little useful purpose other than to pound another nail into the coffin. Here is a gifted actor who apparently by his own decision has brought desolation upon his head. He was serious when he said he would never act again. He was serious when he announced a career as a hip hop artist. He wasn't goofing when he was on the Letterman show. He was flying into pieces. Advertisement For reasons which are unclear and sidestepped, this process was documented on video by the actor Casey Affleck, who is married to Joaquin's sister Summer. It's not well-done technically\u00a0-- the image and sound are bad -- but it has the advantage of access to private and tormented moments. After Phoenix imploded during a famous appearance on Letterman, we see him leaving a limousine in Central Park, crawling up an embankment into some shrubbery, and screaming that he has destroyed his life, his music sucks, he will never be able to act again, and \"I'm totally f**cked!\" All of this is true. At least we must assume it is. If this film turns out to still be part of an elaborate hoax, I'm going to be seriously pissed. Actually, there are subtle signs it might be. The scene in Central Park: Is it a little too perfect dramatically? The scenes of cocaine sniffing, the nude parties including Joaquin's assistant Antony Langdon and two hookers: Were they really possible with a director, cinematographer and sound man in the room? Would Casey Affleck release this devastating film with the acquiescence of his wife? Apparently so. It exists, it was released, I've seen it, and Joaquin Phoenix, as the title assures is, is still there. One doubts he will be walking the red carpet if the film has a premiere. It documents a train wreck. A luxury train. One carrying Phoenix, his several personal assistants, his agent, his publicist, and apparently not one single friend who isn't on salary. A train that flies off the tracks and tumbles into the abyss. Phoenix comes across as a narcissist interested only in himself. He is bored with acting. He was only a puppet. He can no longer stand where he's told, wear what he's given, say what is written. It's not him. He has lost contact with his inner self. He allows that true self to emerge here as a fearsomely bearded, deliberately shabby chain-smoking egotist who screams at his patient assistants, blames himself on everyone else, and has deluded himself into thinking that there is a future in his dreadful hip-hop lyrics.  Advertisement He think fame and fortune are due him. He earned them in his acting career, yes, but he will no longer act. He expects Sean Combs to want  to produce his CD, although Combs has worked hard to earn the respect that Phoenix manifestly doesn't deserve. He's a little surprised that Combs remains sensible during their negotiations, expecting to be paid for his services and oh, you know, studios, musicians, sound engineers, those kinds of things. He stands in the middle of an airport, puzzled that no limousine awaits. He flies to Obama's inauguration, not invited, and doesn't make it outside of his hotel room. He is mystified that he may no longer be able to afford his Los Angeles home. Phoenix's hip-hop performances are incomprehensible. The lyrics that we hear are lead-footed and stupid. During one performance he races from the stage and vomits copiously. He is enabled by his saintly staff, including Antony Langdon, who has been with him for years and appears to be paid as a 24-hour companion, since it's doubtful anyone would want to be with this man for free. Antony, we learn, has recently become a recovering alcoholic. Which leads us to Phoenix's substance abuse problems. He doesn't drink much in the film. He smokes a great deal of what looks like pot. He says he scored cocaine in New York, and hardly seems to be using it for the first time. He has no onscreen moment when he appears clean or sober. Whether drugs alone could account for his condition, or whether mental illness is also involved, is not for me to say. But I will say this. Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor. I was astonished by his performance as Johnny Cash in \"Walk the Line\" (2005). He was so good in other films, including the superb \"Reservation Road\" (2007), \"Two Lovers\" (2008) and \"Gladiator\" (2000), although I was unenthusiastic about the film. Whether he wants to be an actor is his business. Many great and worthy people have been, and in this film we see or hear about Paul Newman, Sean Penn, Jack Nicholson and for that matter Danny DeVito (who Phoenix dismisses). \u00a0 Advertisement I have hope that if Phoenix ever cleans up his body and mind, he can be restored, and can be happy again. See how Robert Downey Jr. and Dennis Hopper came back from the edge of the grave. We do not desperately need another actor, but Joaquin is imprisoned within his illness, and he desperately needs to get well. If he wants a career as a singer -- well, why not country music? In \"Walk the Line\" he proved he has a talent for it. In \"I'm Still Here\" all he proves is that he is hurtling toward the same pointless oblivion that killed his brother River. It is a waste of the privilege of life. Note: Regarding the film's 3-str rating: It could be one, it could be four. What do stars have to do with it?"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Cantinflas", "Review": "Movie biopics are often derided for compressing a historical figure\u2019s life into something resembling a greatest-hits package. This is true only of bad biopics. Biopics usually come in two flavors. There are those that dig beneath the highlights in order to get at the life force that made a single life stand out from all the rest. \"Malcolm X\" and \"Nixon\" are gold standards of this type. Then, there are biopics where filmmakers take a specific moment in time and use it to illuminate both its historical ramifications and the lives of those who made history. \"Hitchcock,\" \"Frost/Nixon,\" and \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" are prime examples. Sebastian del Amo\u2019s \"Cantinflas\" is an ambitious biopic that attempts to combine the two by telling the life story of the pioneering Mexican comic actor while dramatizing a crucial week in the career of producer Michael Todd in his attempt to wrangle an international cast for his big Hollywood production, \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" The result, I\u2019m afraid, is a big disappointment, a disjointed mess that tries to create a point-counterpoint narrative with these two savvy showmen, which inevitably tips the scales in favoring one of them. The problem is, it\u2019s not the one you think. For most American moviegoers, Cantinflas is the answer to a trivia question: Who was the biggest movie star in the world, only to rival Chaplin\u2019s Little Tramp in popularity, who never conquered Hollywood? Born Mario Moreno, Cantinflas was a boxer and bullfighter before discovering he had a gift for improvised comic riffing. The Cantinflas character became an almost folkloric hero as he used the guise of an earnest peasant to satirize and mock those who needed to be taken down a peg or two. His popularity was such that he was able to demand complete creative control over his movies. (He made over thirty pictures.) As leader of the actors\u2019 union, he stood up against the encroaching corruption in Mexico. He was married to the same woman for his entire life. When he died at age 81, his funeral turned into a three-day celebration that was attended by thousands. Michael Todd led an equally rich life. After having huge successes on Broadway as a producer, he first broke into movies by creating the Todd-AO widescreen process, a process that is considered by some to be even better than Cinerama. \"Around the World in 80 Days\" was conceived as a star-studded spectacle that would be peppered with cameos from stars around the world that would guarantee it to be a worldwide success. As dramatized in \"Cantinflas,\" the only problem with Todd\u2019s grand vision was getting superstars to appear in the movie without having to pay their price. Of course, Todd eventually triumphed and \"Around the World\" would go on to win five Oscars, including Best Picture. Separately, these two stories offer the potential for good drama, but the screenplay by Edui Tijerina and del Amo uses a back-and-forth structure that\u2019s supposed to create tension but instead keeps breaking it. The result is an imbalance in the storytelling. The movie is called \"Cantinflas,\" but it turns out the Todd storyline is the one with the dramatic weight. There\u2019s a light, almost finger-snapping quality to the Hollywood sequences that leads to impatience every time we\u2019re forced to go back to Mexico, especially when we realize the Cantinflas arc lacks any real dramatic conflict. (As the movie plays, Todd struggles more than Cantinflas.) The scenes set in 1955 Los Angeles are given a sunbaked look that for once doesn\u2019t rely on bright yellow filters. The Mexico sequences have a muted color palette that doesn\u2019t rely on dust and grime for its effects. The two storylines are so visually detailed that we really don\u2019t need title cards informing us of the passing of time. The movie tries to find a correlation between the two mens\u2019 lives, but there really isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s all surface. Cantinflas\u2019 life is reduced to highlights minus much dramatic force. (We\u2019re almost halfway through the movie before we see him on a movie set.) His comic talent and rapport with the public is mostly told to us, not shown. The staging of the scenes involving moviemaking have no juice. A subplot involving union corruption is sketchy at best. (We see the exchanging of an envelope and that\u2019s about it.) This is too bad because Oscar Jaenada looks like he\u2019s capable of handling the role. He has a loose-arm way about him in the early scenes that\u2019s quite winning, but as written, Cantinflas is more of an icon than a character. Jaenada is real good in scenes where Cantinflas shows flashes of cruelty, as in when he fires a director who doesn\u2019t understand his brand of improvised comedy. The script has Mario Moreno buying into his Cantinflas persona and thus taking the joy out of him. Problem is, we never get to know the character before he becomes Cantinflas. He\u2019s rather bland in the opening scenes. By the time Cantinflas hits the stage we\u2019re forced to accept his greatness as a performer.At least the Michael Todd section has a little bit of suspense. There\u2019s a ticking-clock component to these scenes as Todd races around town to get contracts signed before a major press conference. Michael Imperioli is a lot of fun as he lets us see Todd\u2019s desperation while never breaking a sweat. I also liked the performance by Ilsa Salas as Cantinflas\u2019 wife Valentina. It\u2019s through her performance that we sense the change in his personality. The best scene in the movie is when Cantinflas comes home and finds Valentina upset because he forgot about an important doctor\u2019s appointment. She was all alone when she found out she\u2019s unable to have children. The scene climaxes with Valentina weeping and Cantinflas walking away as a thunderstorm rages and a Mexican ballad is heard on the soundtrack. Some might laugh at the over-the-top nature of the scene, but it\u2019s in keeping with a long and proud tradition of Mexican melodrama. The movie could\u2019ve used more of that. It shouldn\u2019t matter that the movie inflates \"Around the World in 80 Days\" with a level of importance that I\u2019m guessing isn\u2019t called for. It\u2019s a movie known by reputation more than anything else these days. (It beat out \"Friendly Persuasion,\" \"Giant,\" \"The King and I\" and \"The Ten Commandments.\") The movie backs itself into a corner by ending with Cantinflas winning the award for Best Actor. The bad joke of this triumphant climax is it takes place at the Golden Globes. (The filmmakers are shrewd enough not to mention this fact. It\u2019s like an implicit acknowledgement that even the filmmakers don\u2019t think \"Around the World\" is all that great.) None of this would matter, but the shoehorning in of one of these story arcs into the other is constantly pulling us out of the movie. Imagine the movie \"Hitchcock\" except half the running time was given over to a biopic of Anthony Perkins. While a biopic of Perkins\u2019 life would be a fascinating study in duality, it unfortunately has no real connection to the story of the making of \"Psycho.\" There\u2019s one more important note that needs to be made about this movie. \"Cantinflas\" is being distributed by Lionsgate as part of their ongoing distribution strategy of releasing Spanish-language movies in the U.S. aimed primarily at Spanish-speaking moviegoers. Good for them. Clearly, their success with Tyler Perry showed them there are untapped markets craving product. It seems the crucial difference between the movies aimed at African-American audiences and Latino moviegoers is a willingness to court mainstream acceptance. The Spanish-language releases have shown an audience is there, but a sense of isolation hangs over these movies. There is great irony that \"Cantinflas\" the movie shows Cantinflas the man telling Michael Todd that he\u2019s going back to Mexico and isn\u2019t really interested in Hollywood. (Whether he was unwilling to deal with the inevitable racial barriers he would have to overcome or just liked being the one at the top in Mexico is never fully articulated.) \"Cantinflas\" is a movie that isolates itself from its own audience.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Mermaid", "Review": "\"The Mermaid\" will make you laugh.  It doesn't matter if you don't like subtitles. It doesn't matter if you've never heard of the director. It doesn't matter if you've never seen a Chinese\r\n movie in your life.  It will make you laugh. Guaranteed. \n \"The Mermaid\" is a romantic-comedy\u00a0fantasy from actor-director-producer Stephen Chow (\"Kung Fu Hustle,\" \"Shaolin Soccer\") about a billionaire who falls in love with a mermaid. Paul Reubens'\u00a0description of Pee-Wee\r\n Herman as \"a simple thing to hang a bunch of stuff on\" could\r\n apply to this movie. It's a gag machine with gears that never stop turning. \r\nChow's broad, at times bawdy sense of humor, is tempered by a \r\nkeen eye for composition, and his comic timing makes even\u00a0the goofiest, broadest jokes work. In fact nearly all of the jokes of every kind work. If you'd told me this in advance of my first viewing of the film, on opening night in a Manhattan theater, I wouldn't have believed it, but the sound of a sold-out audience laughing from start to finish is the surest metric of whether a comedy works. This movie works.  Advertisement \n The plot: Jerkish tycoon Liu Xuan (Deng Chao) has made a ton of money off of\u00a0sonar technology that incidentally\u00a0murders\u00a0all\u00a0nearby\r\n sea-life. This includes an understandably pissed-off community of \r\nmer-people, led by spiteful Octopus (Show Luo) and naive\u00a0mermaid\r\n Shan (Lin Yun). Since Liu Xuan has a weakness for the ladies, Shan is \r\ntasked with avenging her fellow cryptids by\u00a0seducing and killing him.  But there's a problem: Shan and Liu Xuan like each other.\u00a0\r\n \n \"The Mermaid\" has many hallmarks of Chow's working-class-egotist-makes-good\r\n style of comedy. Chow may not be playing the (apparently \r\nnot-so-) exaggerated\u00a0version of his petulant public person here, as he \r\noften does. But Liu Xuan can easily be read as Chow's stand-in:\r\n he's rich, but \"low-class,\" in the words of Shan's spiteful, mega-rich \r\nrival Ruolan (Zhang Yuqi). Flashy clothes and \"Cribs\"-style parties, \r\ncomplete with poolside babes and decades-old wine, are the hallmarks of\r\n Liu Xuan's nouveau riche\u00a0lifestyle. So when\r\n Shan shows up, wearing smeared make-up and ugly\u00a0rubber weights to \r\ndisguise her fins, everybody knows that Liu Xuan will still\u00a0chase after \r\nher. He's a phony, as is made apparent by his paste-on pencil mustache. \r\nTony Stark he ain't.\u00a0But\r\n that's part of his character's wisp-thin appeal: he's instantly recognizable as a fake who nevertheless\u00a0wants to make good.\u00a0 \n Still, while\u00a0Chao's appropriately \r\nexaggerated\u00a0performance makes Liu Xuan a likable antihero, Lin's turn as\r\n Shan is the film's secret weapon. A skilled supporting cast \r\nof\u00a0comedians, including Shan's fellow sea-people, all\u00a0earn laughs, but Lin has the\u00a0unenviable\u00a0task of making\r\n you believe that Shan is as awkward as she seems. You have to buy the \r\nnotion\u00a0that Shan's sincere when\u00a0she flashes\u00a0Xiu Luan and he\r\n insists that he get a better look at her\r\n wild charms.  Lin's apparent\u00a0sincerity works wonders since\u00a0Chow's sense \r\nof humor always tends to be more extreme than you expect. I've seen a \r\nfair number of Chow films, but his sexual or violent humor always takes\r\n me by surprise, as in a police-sketch\r\n routine involving a merman penis and a routine about roast \r\nchickens and\u00a0cunnilingus. Lin thankfully makes you believe that\u00a0such\u00a0a \r\nnaive woman could stumble into a romance with a man she wants to \r\nassassinate. Lin's not a victim of Chow's dirty mind:\r\n she's an essential\u00a0collaborator. \n You may be wondering, If this movie is so bizarre, so wonderful, so funny, why haven't I heard of it? The answer to that question is infuriating. Chow's \"Shaolin Soccer\" and \"Kung Fu Hustle\" were international hits, and he's a mega-star\r\n in\u00a0his native\u00a0Hong Kong. Last weekend, \"The Mermaid\" \r\nshattered domestic box office records in China and\r\n\r\nbecame the #2 movie in the world, after \"Deadpool.\" Its American release is an afterthought for one reason: mismanagement by its American distributor, Sony Corporation of America. (In theory the film is distributed by Asia Releasing, a subsidiary that handles the release of Asian films in the US and Canada, but the print I saw had a plain old Sony logo in front of it.)\u00a0 Advertisement Sony \r\nought to be ashamed for\u00a0keeping such a good film\u00a0from American viewers \r\nwho aren't already\u00a0part of the Chinese diasporic\r\n community. Three of the four Sony representatives I spoke with didn't \r\neven know that the company was releasing \"The Mermaid.\" The fourth \r\nrep told me that his company hadn't thought to set up advanced \r\nscreenings for US press, or even send out an email alerting them to the film's impending release. I was told that the film \r\nhad already\u00a0gotten\u00a0positive reviews\u2014all pegged to its release in \r\nAsia\u2014and that Sony didn't expect it to interest many people, outside of Chinese or Chinese-American film fans.  This is the sad reality of foreign films in\r\n America today: the domestic marketplace is so hopelessly biased in favor of English-language films, most of them produced in the United States, that the second most popular movie in the world is treated as if it doesn't even exist.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "October Baby", "Review": "\"October Baby\" tells the story of a 19-year-old college student named Hannah, who is introduced by collapsing onstage in the first act of a college play. In a fraught scene with her doctor and her parents, she learns that her collapse was likely associated with childhood epilepsy, and that it might be related to her birth. \"We aren't your birth parents,\" says her father (John Schneider), adding somewhat hurriedly that they always meant to tell her, but\u2026 Hannah (Rachel Hendrix) discovers that she was born as the result of a failed late-term abortion. Her father doesn't want her to know this, but her mother (Jennifer Price) silently hands over her birth certificate. After a long lakeside discussion with lifelong friend Jason (Jason Burkey), she decides to join Jason and a group of friends on a trip to Mardi Gras; they can stop off on the way in Baton Rouge to meet Hannah's birth mother, which seems a rather casual way to treat that emotional event. Advertisement The trip is unhelpful to the plot, which surrounds a potentially strong story with distracting changes in mood and style. Low-rent comedy relief centers around Jason's cousin B-Mac (Chris Sligh), the bearded and roly-poly owner of an old Volkswagen van he treasures as a \"classic.\" There are too many scenes along the way, as the old van (the vehicle of choice in countless 1960s road movies) rolls down highways while the soundtrack bursts with middle-of-the-road pop-rock.  An undetermined number of friends share the van with them, including a young black woman who is placed prominently in several shots but is never mentioned, identified or spoken to. Her purpose is to show that they have a black friend. Then there's an ungainly scene in a hotel where Hannah and Jason are so determined not to share the same bed that they end up camping out in the lobby. This comes after the night clerk offers them the deluxe luxury suite, but they request a regular room. Turning down the free suite doesn't sound typical of college students \u2014 hey, maybe it had two bedrooms? This whole stretch feels like padding. I was painfully unconvinced when Hannah finds the hospital listed on the birth certificate, which looks like a boarded-up motel, and she and Jason break in \u2014 expecting, I guess, to find Hannah's files still waiting around? They're arrested for breaking and entering, and in a clunky coincidence, the cop on duty just so happens to know the nurse who signed the certificate. Now, at last, comes a scene with the weight and dialogue the story deserves. Jasmine Guy plays Nurse Mary, who is able to describe to Hannah the entire story of her birth and the trauma of her mother. (The mother feared her law career would be threatened by having the baby of a man she met only once, in a bar, while drunk.) So shaken was Nurse Mary that she never assisted in such a procedure again. In another convenient coincidence, she \"happened\" to run into the birth mother (Shari Rigby) a few weeks ago, luckily recognizing her after 19 years and thus is able to hand Hannah her business card. Not every birth mother is tracked down so efficiently. Jasmine Guy's monologue here is so well-performed and effective that we almost forgive it for being such a contrivance that shoehorns in all the film's necessary background detail. There is a scene with Hannah and the birth mother, but it's a disappointment. This woman is detached and uninterested, and stays in the movie only long enough for Hannah to stand on the sidewalk and see her and her husband with their own beautiful baby girl, who solemnly waves at Hannah (apparently sensing they are sisters?). Shari Rigby appears again in the end credits, where at last the movie finds more time to let her speak. Then comes another monologue dropped from the sky. Hannah wanders into a Catholic church, and a priest (Rodney Clark), luckily hanging around, asks if he can help. She's a Baptist, Hannah says, but fortunately a priest can help even a Baptist, and the priest quotes from one of Paul's epistles and follows it with brief advice about the importance of being able to forgive. Having discovered forgiveness, Hannah and the movie use it to resolve all the outstanding conflicts in the story involving the birth mother, her adoptive parents and Jason. \"October Baby\" is being promoted as a Christian film, and it could have been an effective one. Rachel Hendrix is surprisingly capable in her first feature role, and Jasmine Guy is superb in her scene. Unfortunately, the film as a whole is amateurish and ungainly, can't find a consistent tone, is too long, is overladen with music that tries to paraphrase the story and is photographed with too many beauty shots that slow the progress.

No, \u201cTerm Life\u201d is just a run-of-the-mill, poorly made\r\nthriller that doesn\u2019t thrill. It\u2019s a wannabe noir with no atmosphere, and a waste\r\nof a talented cast by a director who really has no idea what to do with them.\r\nGreat actors wander in and out of a scene, some of them get shot, some just\r\ndisappear, and the move trudges onward. At least it pauses briefly to address\r\nVince Vaughn\u2019s ridiculous haircut.  Advertisement Vaughn stars as Nick Barrow, a man who literally introduces himself\r\nvia narration with the line \u201cI plan heists.\u201d (The narration is the only\r\nlaughably fun part of the movie with insanely on-the-nose bon mots like \u201cBeing\r\ninterrogated by a cartel leader is not how I expected my day to start out.\u201d)\r\nNick is to illegal activity as a wedding planner is to nuptials\u2014he designs the event and then gets a cut when it succeeds. His latest plan goes awry when the perpetrators\r\nare gunned down after pulling it off. It turns out that Nick\u2019s latest customer\r\nwas the son of a notorious cartel leader (Jordi Molla). If you\u2019re thinking that\r\na movie about a drug dealer getting vengeance for his son\u2019s murder would be\r\nenough, you\u2019re ahead of \u201cTerm Life.\u201d It ALSO turns out that the robbery\r\naggravated a dirty cop named Keenan (Bill Paxton) and his crew (including Mike\r\nEpps and Shea Wigham) are the ones who actually killed the drug lord\u2019s kid to\r\nget back what he stole.  Still not enough movie for you? OK, let\u2019s graft on a\r\nfather-daughter plot. When Nick realizes that a notorious criminal mastermind\r\nand a team of dirty cops are after him, he does what any estranged father would\r\ndo\u2014he buys life insurance (hence the film\u2019s name). But, as he\u2019s told by the\r\ninsurance agent (a fascinatingly underused Taraji P. Henson, who sells the\r\npolicy and disappears), he has to survive three weeks for the blood work to go\r\nthrough, or else his daughter Cate (Hailee Steinfeld) won\u2019t get anything when\r\nhe\u2019s iced. So, Nick and Cate go on the run, provoking the suspicions of a small\r\ntown cop played by another actor too good for the size of his role (Terrence Howard).\r\nI didn\u2019t even mention the fact that Cate\u2019s mother is a recovering alcoholic. It\u2019s\r\nall so much movie and yet so little at the same time. The every-clich\u00e9-and-the-kitchen-sink approach of \u201cTerm Life\u201d\r\nleads to a crushingly bland affair. It\u2019s kind of like how every color blends\r\nto gray eventually. Nothing in \u201cTerm Life\u201d is developed enough in its 93-minute\r\nrun time to give it any weight. Paxton\u2019s villainous cop deserved a better movie\r\n(there\u2019s a scene in the middle between him and Wigham that is a perfect example\r\nof a point where the film could have become something else but went back to the\r\nmiddle of the road), as does the great Jonathan Banks\u2019 buddy and even Jon Favreau\u2019s\r\ncriminal lackey. Most of all, the talented Steinfeld gives \u201cTerm Life\u201d way more\r\nthan the film deserves, playing the anger of a young woman ignored by her\r\nfather her entire life. Sadly, Billingsley doesn\u2019t know what to do with her\r\nperformance, too often pushing it back to clich\u00e9. What do teen girls do? Go swimsuit shopping! (For the record, this is where I would have checked out were it not my professional obligation to continue.) Advertisement Ultimately, there\u2019s no sense of danger or world creation\r\nhere. These people don\u2019t exist in the real world, and Billingsley has no idea\r\nhow to make it feel like they do. It\u2019s one of those films that thinks casting\r\nequates to audience concern. Why do we care about what happens to Nick and\r\nKate? Because their faces are on the poster. And it absolutely fails as an\r\naction film. Billingsley, the director of \u201cCouples Retreat,\u201d does not have any clue what to do with stunt work or shoot-out choreography. There\u2019s one\r\nscene in which Nick is supposed to throw a guy out a window and the stunt man\r\nbasically just runs for the glass, while Vaughn pats him on the back on the way\r\nby.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Unsane", "Review": "Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cUnsane\u201d opens from the perspective of a stalker. We hear in voiceover how the object of his affection made him see the world in a completely new way. And make no mistake. This woman is an \u201cobject\u201d to this man, someone who does not have her own agency or reality outside of what she can do for him. We will later learn that the stalker is a man named David Strine (Joshua Leonard) and the woman is Sawyer Valentini (Claire Foy), whom he met while she was caring for David\u2019s father in his final days. He became obsessed with her because of the comfort she provided his father, and, by extension, David. In other words, she became an object that made him feel good and so he felt a truly one-sided connection, as they often are with stalkers. On the surface, \u201cUnsane\u201d is a potboiler, a routine stalker thriller. But it\u00a0works because of how much there is going on within that familiar structure, courtesy of Jonathan Bernstein & James Greer\u2019s smart script, Soderbergh\u2019s claustrophobic direction, and Claire Foy\u2019s committed lead performance. Advertisement Sawyer has been traumatized by her experience with David, and it\u2019s impacted her professional and personal life in a way that has made her seek treatment. She goes to a facility, tells her story, and fills out a few forms. Before she knows it, she\u2019s being asked to hand over her personal belongings and asked to strip. She\u2019s going to have to stay for at least 24 hours for observation. Of course, she freaks out, trying to get a hold of her mother (Amy Irving), and even calling the police. When she mistakes an orderly for her stalker and strikes him, her \u201csentence\u201d is increased to seven days. She meets a threatening patient named Violet (Juno Temple) and a supportive one named Nate (Jay Pharoah), who tells her that she\u2019s basically part of an insurance scam, in which hospitals like this one admit patients just to get money from their providers.    As if all of this wouldn\u2019t be nightmare enough, Sawyer is startled to see David handing out medication to the patients. At first, he claims to have no idea who Sawyer is, and her admissions of trauma allow those around her to easily disbelieve her claims that her stalker has infiltrated the hospital at which she\u2019s staying. There\u2019s a fascinating subtext that's woven through \"Unsane\"\u00a0about listening to women when they tell you something wrong. The first doctor that Sawyer goes to in a panic when she realizes she has to stay doesn\u2019t get off the phone right away to talk to her; an attorney that Sawyer\u2019s mother calls for help hangs up without waiting for questions or even saying goodbye; and even the new role in which Sawyer may or may not be seeing David is that of a controlling male: someone literally drugging the people under his care so they\u2019ll behave in the way they want him to. Without overplaying the gender dynamics in \u201cUnsane,\u201d Bernstein, Greer, and Soderbergh have something to say about controlling, unlistening, needy men. (And there\u2019s another commentary on the failure of our healthcare system that ties this work to \u201cLogan Lucky,\u201d which also undeniably had that theme.)    And they say it with a daring new visual style. \u201cUnsane\u201d was shot on an iPhone and has a crazy aspect ratio of 1.56:1. It\u2019s somewhere in between an old-fashioned full-frame ratio and a traditional widescreen, creating a boxy look that perfectly suits a film about someone who\u2019s essentially trapped. Once again, Soderbergh presents such a remarkable economy of visual language, as he does in almost all of his work. It doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a wasted shot here. (If anything, it feels like a few scenes could have used a bit more material.)\u00a0For the most part,\u00a0\u201cUnsane\u201d is lean and mean, giving you just what you need to stick with it. And the visual style has an immediacy that adds to the intensity, especially in early scenes when confusion reigns and most of all in a fantastic sequence that has already been called \u201cThe Blue Room Scene.\u201d It feels like a style that allows little room for traditional acting or production crutches, which places more weight on Foy\u2019s shoulders. She rises to the challenge with a complex, daring performance. She\u2019s great here.    Advertisement While Soderbergh does all he can to elevate the material, the final act doesn\u2019t land with the same weight as his best work as the script veers down a few roads that include a few too many plot holes and diminish the work overall. It's a bit frustrating to see \"Unsane\"\u00a0succumb to some traditional traps in the final scenes, especially after being so daring up to that point. Having said that, the first hour is so interesting, Foy is so good, and Soderbergh is so clearly still at the top of his game, that the relative failures of the climax can be forgiven.    After a brief retirement, Soderbergh has come roaring back with two very different films in \u201cLogan Lucky\u201d and \u201cUnsane.\u201d He\u2019s reportedly already submitted a cut of another movie, starring Andre Holland, to be released later this year, and he directed the series \u201cMosaic\u201d for smartphones and HBO. He\u2019s not only back, he\u2019s as active as he\u2019s ever been. And the film world is better for it."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "You Will Be My Son", "Review": "\"You Will Be My Son\" subtly transforms from one genre to another the way an exquisite, complex wine teases the nose before finishing strongly on the palate.  French director and co-writer Gilles Legrand shows great mastery of tone and pacing in his third feature, which begins life as a domestic drama set at a family-owned vineyard and slowly morphs into a tense thriller. Certainly a sense of foreboding is present from the start. Death appears everywhere, early and often, from the stark opening image of a coffin entering a crematorium to the daily discarding of grapes that don't make the grade.\u00a0Ghosts from the preceding eleven generations that have owned and operated this slab of Saint-Emilion land seem to hover about the place, lending a feeling of weight and importance. This isn't just wine they're making but history, which makes the characters' choices for the future that much more significant. Advertisement At its core, though, Legrand's film is about a father and son\u2014or, rather, about two fathers and two sons, and the power of passing down a legacy.  The great Niels Arestrup gives a commanding performance as Paul de Marseul, the respected veteran winemaker in charge of the estate. His offerings are renowned worldwide for their quality, thanks in large part to a 40-year partnership he's had with his solid and quietly loyal vineyard manager, Fran\u00e7ois (Patrick Chesnais). But when Paul learns that Fran\u00e7ois is suffering from pancreatic cancer and doesn't have much longer, he must make plans to continue the operation. It seems natural that Paul would pass along Fran\u00e7ois' responsibilities to his own son, Martin (Lor\u00e0nt Deutsch), but it's clear from the first time we see them interact that Paul has nothing but disdain for his only child. As elegant and charming as Paul can be in schmoozing up a journalist who's writing a piece on the vineyard, he can be just as cruel and critical toward his son, never passing up the opportunity to get in his petty digs. Martin seems quite capable of running the administrative side of the business, and he has a happy marriage with the beautiful and strong Alice (Anne Marivin). But he's a little mousy, his lean runner's frame providing symbolic contrast with the heft of his wide and white-haired father. Martin is eager to step up, but Paul is determined to keep him down, supposedly because he feels Martin lacks the keen nose and palate to be an expert winemaker. Enter Philippe (Nicolas Bridet, in a role that earned him a C\u00e9sar nomination), Francois' son, who's everything Martin is not: great looking, stylish, suave and worldly. Think of a French Bradley Cooper and you'll get the idea. Philippe has traveled the globe honing his craft and now serves as head winemaker for Francis Ford Coppola's vineyard in California, which makes him seem extra sexy and exotic. (He arrives with a $180 bottle of Coppola wine, which Paul amusingly deems \"brutal.\")  In this lush setting of golden skies and rolling hills, Legrand slowly and steadily ratchets up the suspense. Every slight, real and perceived, incenses Martin further as it becomes obvious that Philippe is his father's heir apparent. The fact that he and Philippe were childhood friends growing up together on the family estate magnifies his anger and resentment.  Advertisement Alice's indignation and protective nature add to the tension. Some of the sharpest scenes in \"You Will Be My Son\" (which Legrand co-wrote with Delphine de Vigand) are the ones between Alice and Paul, as he regards his daughter-in-law with not just condescension but also sexism. (Marivin is as fierce as she is beautiful.) At the same time, Francois also becomes mistrustful of Paul's intentions after decades of stoic service to this man. It's the stuff of Greek tragedy, especially with the formidable Arestrup's towering presence at its center. Paul is clearly a terrible human being\u2014selfish and soulless\u2014but his bad behavior also provides a streak of dark humor. Armand Amar's dramatic classical score adds to the feeling of gravitas. But Legrand keeps the proceedings from turning too soapy or self-serious, simply because the setting is so refined and the performances are so nuanced.  The director also clearly loves wine himself. He takes great care to make the texture of the soil seem tangible, and to show the rich hue of an especially spectacular bottle that's been pulled with pride from the cellar. You'll undoubtedly be inspired to pour yourself a glass (or two) afterward."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Tamara Drewe", "Review": "\"Tamara Drewe\" is one of those British comedies in which, one way or another, we envy all of the characters \u2014 even, briefly, the one run over by stampeding cows. If one must be vain, lustful, egotistical or long-suffering, let it be here, at a writers' retreat in the Dorset village of Ewedown, where everyone lives across the street from a field, and there are no bank branches to deface the rustic charm. The writers' colony is run by Nicholas Hardiment (Roger Allam) and his good wife, Beth (Tamsin Greig). He is a best-selling crime novelist and serial adulterer, and she is a saintly helpmate who runs the retreat, befriends the guests, bakes fresh pastries for tea and is reconciled to his tomcatting because at the end of the day, he always returns to her \u2014 for the pastries, possibly. Advertisement Into this pastoral idyll drops the fragrant Tamara Drewe (Gemma Arterton). Once long ago she was a village lass with a big nose. She went off to London to make her fortune and find a plastic surgeon, and has returned to sell the family home. She is now a famous newspaper columnist with a standard-issue nose, the kind of woman men describe as healthy, when they mean so very much more.  The Hardiments are assisted by a robust local lad named Andy Cobb (Luke Evans), who has fallen on bad fortune but cheerfully does odd jobs and harbors a resentment against Tamara, whose family purchased what he still considers his family home. Once in their teen years, Andy and Tamara apparently rummaged a bit among each other's netherlands, notwithstanding her nose. Nicholas the crime novelist is drawn to Tamara like a cat to tuna. He wears his fame like a backstage pass, and Tamara, after all, is not so very difficult to seduce. She is in fact a woman who calls her own shots, and about her lovers is less likely to feel gratitude than pity. Into the mix now comes a famous London rock 'n' roller named Ben Sergeant (Dominic Cooper). I believe it possible that his eye-liner is tattooed.  His presence in town inflames the adolescent girls Jody Long and Casey Shaw (Jessica Barden and Charlotte Christie), who spend their days moping about bored in bus shelters, and lurking behind hedgerows to spy on everyone. Tamara dumps Nicholas for Ben, flirts with Andy, and is one of the many victims of Jody and Casey's meddling with private lives.  The movie was adapted from a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds, and it was inspired by Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd, although there seems to have been an uncredited infusion of French farce along the way. To the game of romantic musical chairs already under way, a new player is added: McCreavy (Bill Camp), a morose American academic who is laboring away at the poetry of Hardy and has come here to Ewedown to be inspired by a village that is indeed far from the madding crowd. He finds a sympathetic ear in Beth and begins to entertain ambitions about other bits of her anatomy.  Advertisement \"Tamara Drewe\" resembles another British village comedy, \"Local Hero,\" in which everyone lived in each other's pockets. Its director is Stephen Frears, a master of many genres; \"High Fidelity,\" \"The Grifters,\" \"Dirty Pretty Things,\" and \"The Queen\" (2006). Here he knows exactly what he's dealing with: foolish and flawed people who harbor desires that may not be good for them. Not all of them can be happy, and it must be said that Frears, with his writer Moira Buffini and Simmonds and Hardy lurking in the background, gives us a story in which everyone gets more or less what they deserve. If these people are silly, they are no sillier than most of us. There is admirable craftsmanship at work in the scene of the unfortunate cattle stampede, and although we regret the fate of its victim, we must admit that no one is really to blame, and a rough justice has been served. There is another pleasure here. All of the characters, except for the two naughty girls, are adults with grown-up ideas and aspirations, however lamentable. I find myself growing weary of the overgrown adolescents who impersonate adult characters in too many recent American films. Even a jolly comedy like this has characters with more depth. For example, at no time in the film does anyone come right out and explain who Thomas Hardy was. The characters are all presumed to already know. Not that you need to know in order to enjoy the film, but it's nice to know stuff you don't need to know, don't you think?"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Grudge Match", "Review": "\"Grudge Match\" takes the popular boxing game of speculation and makes a movie out of it. You know how it goes: Someone will ask a question that kicks off hours of arguments. The most popular one I've heard is \"Would Muhammad Ali in his prime beat a young Mike Tyson?\" The answer, of course, is yes. See \"The Rumble in the Jungle\" for proof. Taking a page from Ali's playbook in that historic fight, Buster Douglas knocked Tyson out. And Buster Douglas is no Muhammad Ali. Discuss amongst yourselves.  Advertisement It's doubtful that cinephiles would get into similar arguments about movie characters, but \"Grudge Match\" hopes you have. The commercials guarantee a fight between the actors who played two of the most memorable boxers in film history, Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta. The unfortunate thing is that these actors are not the same age as they were when they played those famous pugilists. I don't know who asked for a match between those two, but I assure you they didn't want a 70-year-old LaMotta and a 67-year old Rocky. Regardless of how much \"Grudge Match\" pokes fun at its stars' ages (their fight is sponsored by Geritol, for example), it's still two old guys beating the hell out of each other for your enjoyment. There's something a tad exploitative about this.  \"Grudge Match\" belongs to a fast-growing genre I'll call \"Senior Citizen Action Porn,\" or SCAP. Proud members of SCAP include \"Red\" and its sequel, \"Red 2,\" the \"Expendables\" series, and the best of the 2013 crop, Arnold Schwarzenegger's \"The Last Stand.\" These movies may appear to give AARP members something to cheer about, but their main purpose is to soothe middle-aged men's fears of getting old. These films do not speak to anything relatable to people nearing retirement age. Instead, they trot out the action heroes of our adolescence, prop them up with weaponry and get them to do the things they did when they\u2014and we\u2014were younger. It's an ego boost for the actors and a hit off the nostalgia bong for us.  At least \"Grudge Match\" tries to strike a balance between a realistic portrayal of aging and its climactic, action-packed beatdown. It presents a few genuine moments of senior-worthy cheering tucked in the folds of a much younger audience's pandering. Our heroes lay a whuppin' to several folks who disrespect their elders, including a UFC athlete and LL Cool J. And there's a mildly sweet romance featuring Kim Basinger, who looks stunning at 60 and provides the film's sole voice of reason.  Sylvester Stallone plays Henry \"Razor\" Sharp, whose two famous matches with Robert De Niro's Billy \"The Kid\" McDonnen ended with a win for each of them. Their third match, the one that would have broken the tie, is forever put on hold when Razor abruptly resigns a week before the match. The animosity between Razor and The Kid is so great that, 30 years later, they still can't stand to be in the same room together.  Advertisement Bringing them to that room is Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart), son of the Don King-like boxing promoter who handled Razor vs. Kid I and II. Junior is promoting a boxing video game featuring both fighters, and offers Razor $1000 to record his voice and movements for the game. Razor agrees only if he can be scheduled at a different time than The Kid. The Kid has other ideas, showing up during Razor's recording session and causing an equipment-destroying fight. The footage goes viral, and suddenly there's a demand to see these two duke it out in the ring.   The two agree to do it, but for different reasons. Razor needs money so he can pay the retirement home rent of his old trainer \"Lightning\" (Alan Arkin), whom he springs once the fight has been announced. The Kid's motivation is simple revenge; he wants to pummel Razor to settle the decades old question of who's better. The Kid's heart is in it far more than Razor's, especially after Sally (Basinger) returns to town to see him. Sally was Razor's true love back in the day. She's also the mother of B.J. (Jon Bernthal), who happens to be The Kid's kid. This melodramatic development feels unnecessary, but it does allow Basinger and Stallone to remind us they can act. As in \"Cop Land,\" the first Stallone-De Niro collaboration, Stallone acts rings around De Niro. As was the case in the dreadful \"Last Vegas,\" De Niro spends way too much time in a whiny pity spiral that does him no favors.   Casting Kevin Hart was a great marketing idea. He'll pull in yet another generation of viewers. His verbal sparring matches with Arkin are prominently displayed in the ads, and while they're amusing, there is far less Kevin Hart than you're being led to believe. Hart brings a smarmy, Daffy Duck-like sense of hapless greed to his role, which nicely complements the curmudgeonly wisecrack-filled persona Arkin can play in his sleep. It's too bad we only get about 15 minutes of him.  When the climactic fight arrives, I found myself without a side to choose, because \"Grudge Match\" is too timid to ask me to commit to either boxer. Director Peter Segal shoots the match well, but even with the late reveal of one fighter's major disadvantage in the ring, I remained apathetic. I'll give credit to the film for picking a definitive winner, even if the match made the boxing associations of Nevada and New Jersey look like boy scouts compared to the one in Pennsylvania. They sanction a lawsuit and/or a murder waiting to happen.   Advertisement I'm a sucker for boxing movies, so my rating is a tad higher than it should be. But I have limits, and seeing De Niro and Stallone go at it here had the opposite effect than the one \"Grudge Match\" intended. It broke my nostalgia, casting a gloomy dark cloud over my memories of \"Rocky\" and \"Raging Bull.\" I didn't need to see this. Truth be told, the real match between Stallone and De Niro occurred in 1976, when \"Rocky\" went up against \"Taxi Driver.\" Like a lot of boxing matches, the outcome of that remains in dispute."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Souvenir", "Review": "Belgian director Bavo Defurne has been around for a long time, directing commercials, music videos, and a series of short films, a few of which have won awards on the festival circuit. In 2011, he directed his first feature, \"North Sea Texas,\" about a shy boy \"coming of age\" in a small Belgian town. Unlike his shorts, the images in \"North Sea Texas\" are static and over-stylized, the characterizations are cliched or muted and generic. Some of his natural penchant for intensity and eroticism\u2014on display in shorts like \"Saint\" or \"Campfire\"\u2014was lost in the longer format. One of the reasons his second feature \"Souvenir\" is a step up (besides the presence of Isabelle Huppert in the lead role) may be that, unlike \"North Sea Texas\"\u2014which was an adaptation of a YA novel\u2014\"Souvenir\" is an original story, written by Defurne (along with Jacques Boon and Yves Verbraeken). It's more his\u00a0than \"North Sea Texas.\" The story is simple\u2014too simple, in fact\u2014and some of its more intriguing elements could use further developing, but the presence of Huppert makes \"Souvenir\" well worth a look. Advertisement Liliane (Isabelle Huppert) lives a quiet anonymous life. She works in a pat\u00e9 factory. Her job is boring and rote. She takes the bus home and spends the evening drinking and watching quiz shows on television. Into this monotonous life enters Jean Leloup (K\u00e9vin Aza\u00efs), another factory worker who, in his off hours, trains to become a future lightweight champion. He sits with Liliane one day at lunch and he swears she looks familiar to him. He finally puts it together. Decades ago, she won the \"European Song Contest\" (clearly meant to be \"Eurovision\"), and had a brief season as a star. Her stage name was \"Laura.\" Jean asks her if she isn't \"that singer who sings ABBA-like stuff, but not so famous?\" Liliane has no desire to dredge up that past. But something about Jean's childlike enthusiasm cracks her carapace. She admits that yes, she was that \"Laura.\" There was a tabloid scandal involving her husband/manager running off with all her money, and then Laura \"sank into oblivion.\" The central premise of the film is how these two people at different stages in their lives, both in transition, find comfort and energy in teaming up. Jean gets pummeled in the ring. He's not good enough to be a champion and he needs to come to terms with the fact he has no Plan B. Liliane misses being \"Laura,\" and misses having stuff to do besides carefully placing leaves and berries on top of pat\u00e9 eight hours a day. Jean is in awe of her and comes up with the idea that she needs to mount a \"comeback\" and he will be her manager. She goes along with this, reluctantly at first, nervously, and finally enthusiastically. Jean and Liliane segue into a romantic relationship early on, despite the fact that there's a 40-year age difference. Neither of them seem to mind. The May-December nature of their relationship is not the central issue in the film. The central issue is whether or not Liliane can revive her career, if there is still a public out there who remembers her, if she will fall flat on her face in front of an audience or triumph. The way the two actors play the love story it just feels like a logical next step in the characters' collaboration. They sit in the bathtub together and chat about their plans. The relationship\u2014like so much else in the film\u2014is on a low boil. This is refreshing in a lot of ways, but it's also a trap. Advertisement \"Souvenir\"'s low-boil conflicts makes it difficult to discern what exactly is at stake for the characters. It's clear Liliane has missed the stage. She loves hypnotizing an audience with her stylized performances. (Huppert's preplanned pantomime gestures, intuitive phrasing, and husky-voiced spoken-singing style all have to be seen to be believed. She is awkward and riveting, equally.) But how does she feel about fame? About Jean's ambition for her? About music? The film is already so feathery-light it can't take heavier explorations of its themes. Any movie starring Huppert brings with it an aura of excitement. One of Huppert's extraordinary gifts\u2014and \"gift\" isn't even really accurate, it's more ingrained than that\u2014is how she walks into scenes with such freedom she creates a completely unpredictable atmosphere, like the light-headedness at high altitudes. She doesn't take a literal approach to characterization. She puts no limits on her impulses because she trusts her impulses so implicitly. She doesn't appear to say to herself, \"My character wouldn't do that\" or \"My character would never say that.\" The character is\u00a0her, and so her energy is unfettered, electric, uniquely her own. One of the main thrills about her career, and it is unusual for a 64-year-old actress, is how much she works. In 2016 alone, she appeared in \"Louder Than Bombs,\" \"Things to Come,\" and \"Elle.\" She is still a headliner. If you look at her resume, there has been no \"fallow period,\" and for an actress who got her start in the early 1970s, this is so unheard-of as to be almost unprecedented. Huppert brings to \"Souvenir\" her alertness, her spontaneity, her breezy humor. In one scene, she sits backstage at the European Song Contest, putting on red lipstick while staring in the mirror. She stops and stares at her reflection. It's a stand-off. Huppert doesn't try to show the audience what Liliane sees in her reflection. It's our business to interpret the moment, not hers."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Almost Sunrise", "Review": "Last year a very unusual movie came out of China called \u201cPaths of the Soul.\u201d One thing that was unusual about it was that Chinese censors didn\u2019t stamp on a movie that portrayed Tibet, and Tibetan Buddhism, in a positive light. Another was the movie\u2019s subject, an over 1,000 mile journey by foot undertaken by a group of poor Tibetans, a pilgrimage to visit some of their religion\u2019s most holy sites. It was inspiring, moving, sometimes funny. It was hard to imagine a similar journey taking place in the States.\u00a0 Advertisement   \u201cAlmost Sunrise,\u201d a picture credited as by Michael Collins and Marty Syjuco (Collins directed, Syjuco is one of the producer) tells of an even longer walk, from a war memorial in Milwaukee Wisconsin to California, undertaken by two Iraqi war vets. It is in a very real sense a spiritual journey, but one of healing rather than worship. The movie begins with a definition of \u201cMoral Injury.\u201d It is, according to the onscreen text, \u201ca wound to the soul\u201d caused by committing acts \u201cagainst our sense of right and wrong.\u201d The movie begins with Tom Voss, over video footage of him waving flags as a child in the early \u201880s, saying \u201cI have a lot of military history in my family.\u201d In his home town of Milwaukee, nine years after his return from the war in Iraq, the movie shows a boarded-up building with signs in the window reading \u201cPeace In Our City\u201d and \u201cPeace In Our Selves.\u201d After Tom tells his story of an inability to find the latter, the movie shifts to fellow vet Anthony Anderson, whose big brown beard gives him a resemblance to Tom. He tells the camera, \u201cI don\u2019t want people to be around me so I make it intolerable for people to be around me.\u201d He looks for help, but notes, \u201cThe VA as an institution sucks. Because they make mistakes and say it\u2019s your fault.\u201d Around this point the movie tells us that 20 veterans a day commit suicide.   Tom and Anthony, we are meant to understand, undertake their journey to California as a way to keep themselves alive. Their early days on the road are frustrating. Anthony tears up one of his feet trying to walk too far. But eventually the fellows hit a groove, and in each state they cross, there are veterans and other well-wishers to greet them. They spend a long time speaking to each other. \u201cHow can a just God let humans do this to each other,\u201d one of the veterans says, after recounting the horrors of a\u00a0 particular firefight. (The movie interpolates a good deal of video footage shot in Iraq with the veterans\u2019 state-to-state trek.) In a striking desert setting they meet a Native American vet, dressed in full ceremonial gear, for an exchange of perspectives. By the time they reach the water at the end of Santa Monica Boulevard, having been joined on the last seven miles of the journey by a combat mate of Tom\u2019s, what have they achieved. Anthony speaks of having had \u201csome level of faith in people\u201d restored to him. But Tom, while not doubting the trip\u2019s value, particularly in bringing awareness of profound veterans\u2019 issues to light, bluntly says \u201cBy no means did I think that I was better.\u201d   So the movie continues to follow both Tom and Anthony as they search for healing by other means. Tom\u2019s visit to a religious retreat and exposure to a method of therapy works some wonders on him. The movie then goes on to make a strong point about PTSD and \u201cmoral injury,\u201d and the distinctions between the two. I found the case compelling. Some others may not. But \u201cAlmost Sunrise\u201d presents a journey that is very much worth the time of anyone who\u2019s concerned about the effect war has on our brothers and sisters who fight\u2014which should translate to \u201ceveryone.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "That Guy Dick Miller", "Review": "Some years ago, I wrote a piece on \u201cWhite Dog\u201d, Sam Fuller\u2019s excellent, totally messed-up adaptation of Romain Gary\u2019s novel. At the end of the article, I posted a picture of character actor Dick Miller, who appears briefly in the film holding a monkey. Miller looked happy to be in the scene with Kristy McNichol; the monkey not so much. I captioned my picture with the question: \u201cWho is this actor?\u201d I cannot count the number of responses I received that said \u201cit\u2019s that guy Dick Miller!\u201d \u201cThat Guy Dick Miller\u201d is the perfect title for Elijah Drenner\u2019s wildly entertaining documentary chronicling the 50-plus years of Miller\u2019s career. It is filled with an affection for its subject that not only nourishes lifelong fans of Miller but convinces those unfamiliar to immediately seek out his work. Finding Miller is easy, as he\u2019s appeared in nearly 200 roles. In all of them, Miller was always the memorable Everyman, efficient in the creation of a character who, with very little screen time, always left an impression. He could play the lead, as he did in early films like \u201cWar of the Satellites,\u201d but Dick Miller was more often seen as the \u201cvery special guest star\u201d of directors who grew up with his work and loved him unashamedly for it. Advertisement \u201cThat Guy Dick Miller\u201d isn\u2019t afraid to point out that Miller was often the best thing about the movies that utilized him.\u00a0\u201cThey prayed and hoped that Dick would, once again, pull them through a crappy movie,\u201d says Mary Woronov of Joe Dante, Allan Arkush and Jonathan Kaplan, three of the young directors who joined Roger Corman\u2019s New World Pictures back in the early 70\u2019s. Prior to those raunchier flicks, Corman directed Miller in many of Corman\u2019s American International Pictures features. (Miller gives the count as 49.) His most famous role in the AIP era, and possibly the one that endeared him to Kaplan et al., was in 1959\u2019s \u201cA Bucket of Blood.\u201d As the lead, Miller played Walter Paisley, a goofball who longs to impress his beatnik club colleagues. Paisley eventually scores with his sculptures, which are actually people he murdered then covered in clay. How he gets this idea, and the ingredient in his first sculpture, are worth the price of renting \u201cA Bucket of Blood.\u201d Miller and Corman followed \u201cA Bucket of Blood\u201d with \u201cThe Little Shop Of Horrors,\u201d a film Blood\u2019s screenwriter, Charles B. Griffith, had written with Miller in mind for its famous lead, Seymour. Miller opted instead to play a supporting role as a man who came to Mushnik\u2019s flower shop to eat the flowers he bought. (\u201cThey tasted like they were from the funeral parlor,\u201d Miller tells us.) Also in that film was a young Jack Nicholson, whom Miller speaks fondly of in \u201cThat Guy Dick Miller\u201d and who also shared the screen with him in \u201cThe Terror.\u201d That film has\u00a0one of my favorite Miller moments, where he recounts for Nicholson the entire plot of the movie so that the audience can catch up with its extremely confusing, barely coherent narrative. It takes him a minute and a half, which Drenner mercifully speeds up for us. Miller is such a character that Drenner takes the advice offered him by many of the filmmakers he interviews: He just turns on the camera and lets Miller work his magic. Miller gets plenty of comic support from his wife of 55 years, Lainie, who was in \u201cThe Graduate\u201d and with whom he bickers as if they were on an old radio marital sitcom. He tells numerous stories, including one about the aforementioned monkey from \u201cWhite Dog,\u201d who bit Miller several times when not using him as a toilet. When someone points out that Miller wore the same hideous pink suit jacket in about 10 New World Pictures, Drenner fills the screen with its appearances, ending with Miller wearing it for this documentary. It still fits him. Advertisement Childhood friend, Jonathan Haze (who played Seymour in \u201cLittle Shop\u201d) sheds some light on the personal side of Miller, as do Miller\u2019s brothers, Gene and Bill. \u201cThat Guy Dick Miller\u201d uses this information about Miller\u2019s upbringing and family delicately and respectfully, fleshing out its beloved hero without dwelling on the details in a bid for dramatic effect. Bill talks about how Dick and his father didn\u2019t always see eye to eye, and how their similar personalities were possibly the reason. Dick talks about his mother, and how her early death preceded his success as an actor in Corman\u2019s films. Miller also talks about the day he met Quentin Tarantino, and how his role in \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d wound up on the cutting room floor. I wish \u201cThat Guy Dick Miller\u201d had given us more of that cut scene, as it provides the entry point into the documentary: We first see Miller on set with Abe Vigoda (yes, he\u2019s still alive) shooting a short called \u201cCutaways,\u201d about being cut out of famous movies. If the loss of Miller\u2019s work opposite Harvey Keitel\u2019s Winston Wolf weren\u2019t enough to make fans lament, \u201cThat Guy Dick Miller\u201d shows us several of Miller\u2019s unproduced screenplays, including one called \u201cHelp! There\u2019s a Spy in my Bed!\u201d Considering what happened to \u201cTNT Jackson,\u201d one of the few Miller scripts that got made, perhaps it\u2019s for the best that we never got the bed-ridden spy movie. For a talking heads documentary, \u201cThat Guy Dick Miller\u201d is extremely enjoyable, well-paced and informative. Scene after scene of Miller\u2019s work appears, including roles in movies by Corman\u2019s stable of directors once they went to the major studios. Clips from Scorsese\u2019s \u201cNew York, New York\u201d share space with every film Joe Dante ever directed. Corman himself appears onscreen to express pride that his former prodigies found room for his most prolific actor. Film historians like Leonard Maltin and David Del Valle provide historical context and color commentary on Miller\u2019s career. It is Del Valle who provides an excellent summation of why Dick Miller remains so beloved and so employed over his career. \u201cHollywood is not based on talent,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's based on being in the right place at the right time and having within you whatever that is that somebody wants.\u201d Though clearly talented, Miller\u2019s onscreen presence epitomizes what all those filmmakers, and all us fans, continue to want.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done", "Review": "Werner Herzog's \"My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done\" is a splendid example of a movie not on autopilot. I bore my readers by complaining about how bored I am by formula movies that recycle the same moronic elements. Now here is a film where Udo Kier's eyeglasses are snatched from his pocket by an ostrich, has them yanked from the ostrich's throat by a farmhand, gets them back all covered with ostrich mucus, and tells the ostrich, \"Don't you do that again!\" Meanwhile, there is talk about how the racist ostrich farmer once raised a chicken as big as, I think, 40 ordinary birds. What did he do with it? \"Ate it. Sooner pluck one than forty.\" Knowing as I do that Herzog hates chickens with a passion beyond all reason, I flashed back to an earlier scene in which the film's protagonist talks with his scrawny pet flamingoes. Is a theme emerging here? And the flamingo who regards the camera with a dubious look, is it doing an imitation of the staring iguana in Herzog's \"Bad Lieutenant?\" Advertisement For me it hardly matters if a Herzog film provides conventional movie pleasures. Many of them do. \"Bad Lieutenant,\" for example. \"My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done,\" on the other hand, confounds all convention and denies all expected pleasures, providing instead the delight of watching Herzog feed the police hostage formula into the Mixmaster of his imagination. It's as if he began with the outline of a stunningly routine police procedural and said to hell with it, I'm going to hang my whimsy on this clothesline. He casts Willem Dafoe as his hero, a homicide detective named Hank Havenhurst. Dafoe is known for his willingness to embrace projects by directors who work on the edge. He is an excellent actor, and splendid here at creating a cop who conducts his job with tunnel vision and few expected human emotions. It is difficult to conceive of a police officer showing less response to a madman ostrich farmer. His case involves a man named Brad McCullum, played by the inspired Michael Shannon as a man with an alarming stare beneath a lowering brow. He kills his mother with a wicked antique sword, as she sits having coffee with two neighbors. He likes to repeat \"Razzle Dazzle,\" which reminded me of \"Helter Skelter,\" and yes, the movie is \"inspired by a true story.\" His mother (Grace Zabriskie) is a woman who is so nice she could, possibly, inspire murder, especially in a son who has undergone life-altering experiences in the Peruvian rain forest, as this one has--and why, you ask? For the excellent reason, I suspect, that Herzog could to great difficulty to revisit the Urubamba River in Peru, where he shot part of \"Fitzcarraldo\" (1982). Perhaps whenever he encounters an actor with alarming eyes, like Klaus Kinski or Shannon, he thinks, \"I will put him to the test of the Urubamba River!\" Detective Havenhurst takes over a command center in front of the house where Brad is said to be holding two hostages (never seen), and interviews Brad's fianc\u00e9e Ingrid (Chloe Sevigny) and his theater director, Lee Meyers (Udo Kier). Both tell him stories that inspire flashbacks. Indeed, most of the film involve flashbacks leading up to the moment when Brad slashed his mother. Ingrid is played by Sevigny as a dim, sweet young woman lacking all insight and instinct for self-protection, and Meyers is played by Kier as a man who is incredibly patient with Brad during rehearsals for the Greek tragedy, Elektra. That's the one where the son slays his mother. Advertisement The memories of Lee Meyers inspire the field trip to the ostrich farm run by Uncle Ted (Brad Dourif). If you've been keeping track, the film's cast includes almost only cult actors often involved with cult directors: Dafoe, Shannon, Sevigny, Kier, Dourif, Zabriskie, and I haven't even mentioned Oscar nominee Irma P. Hall and Gabriel Pimentel. Havenhurst's partner is played by Michael Pena, who is not a cult actor but plays one in this movie. Little jest. For that matter, the film's producer is David Lynch, one of the few producers who might think it made perfect sense that a cop drama set in San Diego would require location filming on the Urubamba River. There is a scene in this movie that involves men who appear to be yurt dwellers from Mongolia, one with spectacular eyebrow hairs. I confess I may have had a momentary attention lapse, but I can't remember what they had to do with the plot. Still, I'll not soon forget those eyebrows, which is more than I can say for most scenes at the 60% mark in most cop movies. I am also grateful for two very long shots, one involving Grace Zabriskie and the other Gabriel Pimentel, in which they look at the camera for 30 or 40 seconds while flanked with Shannon and another one of the actors. These look like freeze frames, but you can see the actors moving just a little. What do these shots represent? Why, the director's impatience with convention, that's what. I have now performed an excellent job of describing the movie. Can you sense why I enjoyed it? It you don't like it, you won't be able to claim I misled you. I rode on an ostrich once. Halfway between Oudtshoorn and the Cango Caves, it was."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Seven Pounds", "Review": "I am fascinated by films that observe a character who is behaving precisely, with no apparent motivation. A good actor brings such a role into focus, as Will Smith does in the enigmatically titled \"Seven Pounds.\" Who is he, what does he want, why is he behaving so oddly for an IRS agent? And why won't he kiss Rosario Dawson, when they both so obviously want that to happen? As Ben Thomas, the man from the IRS, he can get in anywhere and ask any question. But surely the IRS doesn't require him to punch a nursing home supervisor for not allowing an old lady her bath? And why, after he intuits he is speaking to a blind man on the phone, is he so needlessly cruel to him? And why then does he follow the same man (Woody Harrelson) into a restaurant and engage him in conversation? Advertisement And why does he check into a fleabag hotel? Doesn't the IRS pay him a salary? And what favor does his lifelong friend Dan (Barry Pepper) owe him? And why is he looking for people who need their own favors? And so on. For much of the first hour of \"Seven Pounds,\" Ben Thomas acts according to a plan that seems perfectly clear, but only to himself. The reason it goes unexplained is that he has no need to explain it to himself, and no way to explain it to anyone else. I am reminded of a film you should see some day, Melville's \"Le Samourai,\" about a man who lies on a bed in a dark hotel room and smokes, and gets up, and pays meticulous attention to his appearance, and goes out into the night, and we have no idea who this man is. I find this more interesting than a movie about a man whose nature and objectives are made clear in the first five minutes, in a plot that simply points him straight ahead. Will Smith displays a rather impressive range of emotional speeds here. He can be a tough, merciless IRS man. He can bend the rules on some cases. He can have a candlelight dinner with a beautiful woman named Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) and go home afterward. She can sense his deep sadness. He is angry with people sometimes, but he seems angriest of all at himself. It's quite a performance. And Dawson makes Emily not simply a woman confused, maybe offended, by his behavior, but a woman of instinctive empathy, who does an emotional dance with him, following his lead when he needs to be treated like an IRS agent or like a perfect gentleman or like a man who needs understanding even if she doesn't know what she's supposed to understand. I haven't even hinted about the hidden motives in this film. Miraculously for once, even the trailers don't give anything away. I'll tell you one thing: I may have made Ben sound like an angel, but he is very much flesh and blood, and none of his actions are supernatural. He has his reasons. The director is Gabriele Muccino, who also directed Smith in \"The Pursuit of Happyness.\" He is effective at timing the film's revelations so that they don't come suddenly like a U-turn; they're revealed at the last necessary points in the story. Some people will find it emotionally manipulative. Some people like to be emotionally manipulated. I do, when it's done well. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Citizenfour", "Review": "Though superlatives can mischaracterize any movie\u2019s\r\nqualities, it is not an overstatement, I think, to call \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d Laura\r\nPoitras\u2019 film about Edward Snowden, the movie of the century (to date). That statement is meant, first off, to suggest certain\r\nthings about its relation to our collective past, present and future. No film so boldly X-rays certain crucial changes\r\nwrought upon the world, and especially America and its government, by the\r\nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. No film so demands to be\r\nseen by every sentient person who values his or her own freedom and privacy. No film so clearly implies actions that need to be taken to\r\nprevent the 21st century from turning into an Orwellian nightmare in\r\nwhich technologically-enabled tyranny is absolute and true political liberty,\r\nfor all intents and purposes, nonexistent.  Advertisement This is not to say that \u201cCitizenfour\u201d is a perfect film, if\r\nanyone believes that such a thing exists. On the contrary, perhaps more than\r\nany documentary in history, it invites endless questions about what Poitras\r\nchose to put in and leave out, to emphasize and to elide. But such debates are\r\nonly a secondary\u2013if very fascinating\u2013aspect of a broader national and\r\ninternational discussion that the film deserves to start. They do nothing to\r\ndiminish its colossal importance. Indeed, no film has ever been historic in quite the way this\r\none is, since it tells a story in which the filmmaker and her work play a\r\ncrucial part. It\u2019s as if Daniel Ellsberg had a friend with a movie camera who\r\nfilmed his disclosure of the Pentagon Papers every step of the way. Or if the\r\nWatergate burglars had taken along a filmmaker who shot their crimes and the\r\ncover-up that followed. Except that the issues \u201cCitizenfour\u201d deals with are,\r\narguably, a thousand times more potent than Vietnam or Watergate. The part of the film that shows Edward Snowden being\r\ninterviewed in Hong Kong in June of 2013 (doesn\u2019t it seem longer ago?) occupies\r\nroughly an hour in the middle of its slightly less than two-hour length. The\r\nfilm begins, eerily, like a latter-day \u201cParallax View,\u201d with shots from a car\r\nmoving through a dark traffic tunnel (in Hong Kong, it turns out) as Poitras\r\nreads emails she received from the then-anonymous Snowden. One says that he\r\ndidn\u2019t choose her for the work she is going to do with him; she made the choice\r\nthrough the films she previously made. A title says that after 2006 (when her\r\nIraq film \u201cMy Country, My Country\u201d came out) she was placed on a secret\r\ngovernment watch list and thereafter stopped and searched dozens of times as\r\nshe tried to enter the U.S. This harassment, she notes, prompted her to move to\r\nBerlin. Although she doesn\u2019t say it, Poitras was at work\r\non a film about government surveillance before she first heard from Snowden,\r\nand some of that footage comprises much of the first half-hour of\r\n\u201cCitizenfour.\u201d We see journalist Glenn Greenwald, who will become part of the\r\nSnowden story, working at his home in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. We see Director\r\nof National Intelligence James Clapper and Director of the National Security\r\nAgency (NSA) Keith Alexander both lying to Congress\u2013presumably under oath\u2013about\r\nthe extent of the government\u2019s spying on American citizens. Advertisement But perhaps the most important part of this de facto\r\nprologue concerns William Binney, a government intelligence analyst who turned\r\nwhistleblower to protest abuses he saw taking place in the government\u2019s actions\r\nafter 9/11. For his troubles, Binney was raided by FBI agents who stormed into\r\nhis house with guns drawn. The examples of Binney and others like him of course\r\nindicate the ridiculousness of the claim\u2013made by President Obama and others\r\nin the government and media\u2013that everything would have been fine if Snowden\r\nhad gone through \u201cproper channels\u201d to make his revelations to the American\r\npublic. After contacting Poitras via encrypted email, and later\r\nasking her to involve Greenwald, the still nameless Snowden\u2013\u201ccitizenfour\u201d is\r\nthe first alias he uses\u2013asks the two to go to New York and await further\r\ninstructions. He then tells them to meet him in Hong Kong (which he has chosen\r\nthinking it may be further from the eyes of U.S. intelligence than other\r\nplaces). In my view, the film\u2019s single biggest flaw lies in not\r\nsaying at this point that Snowden sent Poitras and Greenwald massive numbers of\r\nsecret files concerning government surveillance, which they were able to peruse\r\nbefore meeting him. In any case, these materials formed the basis of stories\r\nthe two wrote from Hong Kong, Greenwald for The Guardian, Poitras for The\r\nWashington Post. (An account of what Snowden sent the journalists can be found\r\nin Greenwald\u2019s book \u201cNo Place to Hide,\u201d which deserves to be read in tandem\r\nwith \u201cCitizenfour.\u201d) We do not see Poitras and Greenwald meeting Snowden in the\r\nlobby of Hong Kong\u2019s Mira Hotel (Greenwald recalled they were stunned at how\r\nyoung he was), but within minutes of arriving in Snowden\u2019s room Poitras has set\r\nup here camera and begun filming. True to her cinema verite ethos, the filmmaker mostly remains unseen and\r\nunheard, leaving the questioning to Greenwald, and, beginning on the second day,\r\nanother reporter from The Guardian, Ewan MacAskill. The hour we spend with Snowden and company is matter-of-fact\r\nand in some ways undramatic, yet it is one of the most absorbing things I\u2019ve\r\never seen in a film. (Having now watched the movie three times, I found this\r\nsegment even more riveting on the third viewing than on the first.) What grabs\r\nyou here is not, of course, the contents of Snowden\u2019s revelations, which have\r\nbeen widely reported. Rather, it\u2019s the sense of watching a small group of\r\nindividuals embarked on an enterprise that they know is of tremendous\r\nhistorical import, yet also potentially dangerous and with no guaranteed\r\noutcome. In such a context, every small gesture, pause and decision can seem to\r\ntake on great meaning, creating a constant sense of tension and discovery. Advertisement Then there is the presence of Snowden. In the early stories\r\nGreenwald begins filing from Hong Kong, which create an immediate international\r\nsensation, he doesn\u2019t identify his source, in part because Snowden says he\r\nwants the attention to go to the explosive materials he\u2019s providing rather than\r\nto himself. Yet the attention must soon enough shift to him because, as he made\r\nclear to Poitras early on, he intends to identify himself publicly and take\r\nwhatever consequences may come, hoping he will thereby inspire others to do the\r\nsame. So, a few days into their meetings, Poitras films a 12-minute interview\r\nwith him, which is released to the media, and almost instantly Snowden\u2019s face\r\nand name are known all over the globe. Through all of this, the man himself remains a picture of\r\nremarkable calm, poise and good spirits. In his book Greenwald says he was so\r\nexcited in Hong Kong that he couldn\u2019t sleep more than two hours per night, and\r\nthus could only marvel at Snowden\u2019s ability to turn in at 10 p.m. for exactly\r\nseven and a half hours of sleep. Such details are significant because, in one sense, the real\r\ndrama in \u201cCitizenfour\u201d\u2013and it\u2019s something no book could give us\u2013lies in our\r\nobserving Snowden and coming to our own conclusions about his character and\r\nmotives. No doubt the movie will inspire various reactions. For myself, I take\r\nthe guy at face value. He seems eminently sane and decent, a good guy, smart,\r\narticulate, good-humored and, given the circumstances he\u2019s brought upon\r\nhimself, incredibly courageous.  As for his motives, it befits his status as a millennial\r\nthat he\u2019s passionate about the potential of the Internet and the dangers of its\r\nabuse. Like Greenwald and Poitras, he is also alarmed at the power the\r\ngovernment has accumulated to spy on its own citizenry virtually without limits\r\nor controls, and without the country\u2019s knowledge. He says, in his usual rather\r\nformal way of speaking: \u201cI am more willing to risk imprisonment, or any other\r\nnegative outcome personally, than I am to risk the curtailment of my\r\nintellectual freedom and that of those around me, whom I care for equally as I\r\ndo for myself.\u201d Advertisement After eight days, Snowden leaves the hotel with the help of\r\nChinese human rights lawyers and decamps to a U.N. facility and then a safe\r\nhouse. We see him thereafter in only two scenes somewhat later in Moscow,\r\nwhence he is spirited with the help of WikiLeaks, and where the government\r\neventually grants him one year of political asylum. In the film\u2019s last half-hour, Poitras gives us an almost\r\nimpressionistic chronicle of events flowing from Snowden\u2019s revelations,\r\nincluding Greenwald in Brazil talking with reporters and government people\r\nabout U.S. spying; William Binney and others testifying on the same subject in\r\nEurope; lawyers meeting pro bono to discuss legal strategy for Snowden; the bizarre\r\ndetention of Greenwald\u2019s partner in London and their reunion in Rio. No movie has ever been more justified in including \u201ccitizen\u201d\r\nin its title, and I\u2019m not speaking of just the acts of heroic citizenship by\r\nSnowden, which deserve to be studied and emulated for centuries. The bleakest\r\nimplication of the film is that every government soon swallows up those who\r\nenter it and squelches the impulse for meaningful dissent. Why has no member of\r\nCongress risen to defend Snowden, who is a hero to much of the country and will\r\nbe more so once this film is widely seen? Why have the governments of Germany\r\nand Brazil, two powerful nations outraged by Snowden\u2019s revelations, not offered\r\nhim asylum?  Changing such things, the film very clearly implies, will\r\ndepend on citizens willing to challenge the power of their governments. Throughout\r\ntheir activities, Snowden, Greenwald and Poitras took a gamble on practicing\r\nexactly the kind of transparency and straightforwardness in their work that\r\nthey want to see in the government. The idea being that the more in the public\r\neye they were, the more protected from nefarious doings by the government. It\r\nhas worked, obviously\u2026but only to a point. Snowden\u2019s revelations got out, but\r\nwhat has become of them? It is to be hoped that \u201cCitizenfour\u201d\u2013as it rolls out into theaters in the next\r\nmonths, screens on HBO and goes to the Oscars\u2013will reignite debate and action on all the appropriate\r\nfronts.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Queen of the Sun", "Review": "Almonds are an agribusiness, run by corporations concerned only with profits. In \"Queen of the Sun,\" you will learn that bees would prosper in the valley if there were year-around nectar for them. Would it kill a corporation to set aside some tracts of land for flowers and vegetables? Wouldn't that be easier and more pleasant than mile after mile and row after row of almond trees? Easier for the corporations and easier for the bees? From time to time, a bee truck will be involved in a highway accident. These aren't cute little yellow trucks, but long flatbed trailer-trucks. The bees escape, motorists panic, the cops are called, TV helicopters circle, exterminators swarm in, and no one asks \u2014 why in the hell are we trucking bees across the country? Advertisement We need bees. If bees were to become extinct, animals would be threatened, because so much plant life would cease to exist. On your table, you would find limited choices and high prices. Yet when I mentioned this on my Facebook page, the first reader was prompted to comment: \"I could care less they're creepy I'm allergic sooner they go the better.\"  There are other kinds of pollination, by the wind, by ladybugs, by the coats of animals, but bees do the heavy lifting. We have native bees, but our beloved honeybee was imported from Europe and thrived here until recently. Now they're suffering from Colony Collapse Disorder, in which the beekeeper goes out in the morning and finds his bees are dead or have disappeared. One culprit seems to be the use of insecticides. Bees do a marvelously complex dance to communicate distance and direction to one another, and insecticides can apparently so confuse their navigation that they fly out one morning and forget the way home. This I have learned from Taggart Siegel's \"Queen of the Sun: What Are the Bees Telling Us?\" a remarkable documentary that's also one of the most beautiful nature films I've seen. In exquisite photography by Siegel, we go inside hives and follow bees as they sip on flowers. We also meet beekeepers in sylvan settings (Illinois, Germany, New Zealand, and Italy) and even on rooftops in Manhattan. Yes, there's a movement supporting rooftop hives and gardens. It's true that bees sting. A wasp sting is worse, but a bee sting is no fun. Since the bee dies, it's even less fun for the bee. The beekeepers in \"Queen of the Sun\" often wear masked hoods, gloves and so forth, but just as often, they seem unprotected. One guy with a luxuriant mustache even runs it across the backs of bees on a honeycomb and says, \"They like it.\" He was a brave man who first found this out. Honey and beeswax are valuable cash crops but if bees didn't make honey or wax, they would still be essential to the environment. Bees moved around by truck pollinate $15 billion in crops every year, including your next honey almond. The value of the crops that are naturally pollinated by bees is incalculable. Bees, \"Queen of the Sun\" argues, are part of an intricately choreographed ecosystem that we meddle with at our peril. The same almond trees that must be pollinated via interstate commerce have so depleted their soil that they must be fertilized by chemicals. Crops in rotation have worked for millions of years. Why do corporations poison the environment in order to produce inorganic produce?  Advertisement Taggart Siegel is known to me as the director of an earlier documentary, \"The Real Dirt on Farmer John\" (2005), about an eccentric but inspiring organic farmer in northern Illinois. I was looking for Farmer John and his Dr. Seuss hat in this film, but there's no such luck.  Siegel's message remains the same: We need to trust the Earth to its own hands. The campaign to legalize beekeeping in Manhattan is an example. Are you putting out some flowers this summer and maybe planting a garden? The bees are ready to pitch in for free."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Stories We Tell", "Review": "Families create their own narratives. Stories are passed on from generation to generation, and in this way the past continues to live, but it can also be obscured or distorted. Joan Didion famously wrote, \"We tell ourselves stories in order to live.\" Family arguments often come down to who \"owns\" the narrative, or which version is decided upon as the \"true\" one. Sarah Polley's fascinating documentary, \"Stories We Tell,\" is ostensibly about her mother, Diane Polley, who died in 1990. A powerful and thoughtful film, it is also not what it at first seems, which is part of the point Polley appears to be interested in making. Can the truth ever actually be known about anything? Advertisement In speaking about \"Stories We Tell,\" it is important to avoid revealing the surprises hidden within the film, surprises of fact and surprises of Polley's structure, because the discovery of said surprises is where the film packs its greatest and most indelible punch. The surprises do not operate as cheap \"Gotcha\" moments, but instead draw back veils to show levels, shades, nuances. Diane Polley comes to us in fragments, and we are forced to re-adjust our interpretation of her throughout the film as new details are revealed. At one point, one of Polley's interview subjects balks at the idea of having everyone tell the same story. As far as he is concerned, only two people have the \"right\" to tell that story, and it is the two people involved. Otherwise, he says, \"you can't ever touch bottom.\" Inadvertently, in his criticism, he expresses Polley's whole theme. Polley calls her interview subjects \"The Storytellers,\" and they include her older sisters, Susy and Joanna, and her older brothers, John and Mark, and other important figures in her mother's past. Polley has said she was not interested in being an \"omniscient\" presence, and we can hear Polley's questions and laughter from behind the camera. Her father, Michael Polley, is an actor as well (familiar to anyone who was a fan of the Canadian TV series Slings and Arrows, where, incidentally, Sarah Polley had a role in the third season). \"Stories We Tell\" begins with Sarah setting up her father in a recording booth, to do the narration for the film, which (we find out later) he wrote. So there is already a distancing element in place. It's a film about making a film, and, as Polley tells her father, she sees the interviews as a kind of \"interrogation process.\" She asks each storyteller to \"tell the story from the beginning until now,\" and as they begin, hesitantly at first, Polley supplements the story with old photographs and home movies: beautiful footage of her mother, cavorting on the beach, laughing at parties or around the pool, and, fascinatingly, singing \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" in what looks like an old black-and-white audition tape. Diane Polley is described by one and all as a woman who wanted to live life to the fullest. One person says that her walk was so emphatic \"she made the record skip,\" an eloquent image. One family friend admits in an interview that she always sensed that Diane \"had secrets,\" which turns out to be true. She was an actress, but she gave that up to have her family. The marriage to Michael was happy at first, but discontent grew. Michael was a solitary type of guy, and Diane loved crowds and excitement. Advertisement The storytellers talk about her life, her acting, her children and her marriage, and Polley doesn't privilege one version over another. She is not interested in protecting her version (whatever it may be), or protecting her mother. She is more interested in how her family members interact with their own memories, and where they might intersect or diverge. Polley's touch here is gentle and yet insistent. At times, her siblings ask her, speaking to her behind the camera, \"Well, what do you remember about that time?\" Sarah Polley got her start young in Canadian television, but she showed a rebellious streak early, dropping out of acting altogether as a teenager to focus on politics. Her role in Atom Egoyan's \"The Sweet Hereafter\" (1997) was hailed by American critics, who treated her as a newcomer (although she had been working for years in Canada by that point). Polley resisted the call of stardom, doing what interested her, and making short films through the Canadian Film Centre's prestigious director's program. Her first feature, \"Away From Her,\" was a heartbreaking tour de force, showing Polley's breathtaking confidence as a first-time director. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards (Julie Christie as Best Actress, and Polley for her adaptation of Alice Munro's short story). Polley's second feature was 2011's \"Take This Waltz,\" starring Michelle Williams and Luke Kirby (Kirby, like Polley, was treated as a newcomer by American critics, but he had been riveting in the first season of Slings and Arrows as the American movie star playing \"Hamlet\" in Canada).  In both of these films, and now in \"Stories We Tell,\"\u00a0Polley \r\nexperiments with the expected narrative structures, pushing us to \r\nconsider not just the meaning of stories but how the way we tell the \r\nstory can change its impact. The interviews in \"Stories We \r\nTell\" are amazingly intimate. This is a family talking to each other. \r\nEveryone still misses Diane. The loss they have suffered is \r\nincalculable. The questions Polley asks are not always easy. The answers\r\n aren't simple either. Diane Polley was, in some respects, a trapped woman. It's a common story with a common narrative thread, familiar to us all: she wanted more out of life than just being a mother and a wife, but she was hemmed in by traditional responsibilities. But life is not that simple, and when you learn more about Diane, when you learn some of those \"secrets,\" and one in particular, the cliched narrative thread falls apart. Diane Polley seemed to be an extroverted fun-loving person, and she was, and yet obviously the well was deep (so deep you \"can't reach bottom\"). Life is messy and Diane Polley's narrative is messy. Stories told again and again have a way of neatening things up. Stories have a way of ironing out the wrinkles. Polley lets the wrinkles remain. By the end of \"Stories We Tell,\" I am left with the feeling that there's still so much I don't know about Diane Polley. And what a fitting eulogy that is. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Addiction Incorporated", "Review": "These days, a character who smokes is self-destructive, a villain or a troubled high school student. \"Addiction Incorporated\" follows tobacco's journey downhill from respectability. After his long night's work, Santa used to relax with a Lucky on a back-cover ad in Life magazine, and Ronald Reagan liked to puff on Chesterfields. Now we learn of proposed new government health warnings that are more likely to make you spew than smoke your first cigarette.  The key player in this process was a man named Victor DeNoble, a scientist for Philip Morris, who began with the generally known fact that nicotine was addictive and discovered that a chemical named acetaldehyde made it more addictive. DeNoble was originally hired by Philip Morris to find a substitute for nicotine, in the attempt to develop a less addictive cigarette. (The tobacco industry's reasoning was: Dead smokers don't buy cigarettes.) When DeNoble reported his findings, Philip Morris switched signals and realized it could outsell their competitors by adding more acetaldehyde. At this time, the Tobacco Institute was making phony claims that there was no evidence cigarettes were addictive at all.  Advertisement You may be assuming DeNoble is the same whistleblower played by Russell Crowe in \"The Insider\" (1999). No, that was Jeffrey Wigand, a scientist employed by Brown & Williamson. DeNoble's research was obtained by ABC News, whose corporate bosses vetoed its use. Wigand was leaking to \"60 Minutes\" on CBS, where network executives also were shy. There were a lot of cigarette ads on TV in those days, but more to the point, Big Tobacco had a reputation of suing for millions, and never losing a case. The first half of this doc covers familiar territory; although everyone, even my parents who both died from smoking cigarettes, knew they were addictive, Big Tobacco had always denied it. Now DeNoble's research with laboratory rats proved it beyond a doubt. Rats who pushed a button got a rat-sized dose of nicotine. The first dose made them puke, but soon they were pushing the button 90 times a day. DeNoble was the most harmful witness imaginable to the industry, because he could testify that Philip Morris knew it and hoped to increase sales with its knowledge. The second half of the film begins with a historic series of congressional hearings chaired by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.). Having thoroughly established that the industry knew nicotine was an addictive drug, Waxman summoned the heads of the seven major tobacco companies to testify. In the past they'd always refused to appear. This time, they showed up. Waxman drops a surprise: He places them under oath. They can either agree it is addictive or perjure themselves. All seven raise their right hands and swear smoking isn't addictive. Then DeNoble delivers his historic testimony. In the months to come, all seven resigned from their corporations. DeNoble, from a working-class family, was its first member to attend college. That came after he discovered he was dyslexic, and \"I wasn't stupid like I thought.\" Publication of his Philip Morris findings in a journal would have established his reputation. Instead, learning what his research paper contained, his bosses ordered him to withdraw it and kill his rats. Then they fired him. Today he speaks against cigarettes on national tours paid for by funds that were part of Big Tobacco's settlement with the government. \"Addiction Incorporated,\" directed by Charles Evans Jr., doesn't tell a new story, although it closes very recently with Obama signing the legislation that DeNoble's research put into motion. It's an effective film, livened with animated rats, never boring, and entertaining when it shows Rush Limbaugh, the cigar enthusiast, fulminating against the Waxman hearings. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Shrink", "Review": "\"Shrink\" gives us a high-profile Los Angeles psychiatrist whose life has been reduced to smoking as much pot as he possibly can. If the movie contains a surprise, it's that he doesn't find his way to cocaine. Kevin Spacey brings another of his cynical, bitter characters to life--very smart, and fresh out of hope--but the movie doesn't give him much of anywhere to take it. The idea of rich, famous, drug-addled Hollywood flotsam is not precisely original, and this sort of story has rarely been more strongly told than in \"Hurlyburly\" (1998), with Sean Penn as a cokehead and Spacey himself as a bemused, supercilious witness to the wreckage. As for the behind-the-scenes Hollywood stuff, you can't much improve on Altman's \"The Player.\"\t Advertisement What director Jonas Pate and his writer, Thomas Moffett, do is sidestep deep characterization and bring in a rather conventional assortment of clients for Spacey's shrink, named Henry Carter. We meet a movie star past his sell-by date (Robin Williams, unbilled), who thinks his problem is sex addiction, although Henry assures him it is alcoholism (the sex addict's running mate). Dallas Roberts plays Patrick, an agent driven by hyperactive compulsions; Patrick's assistant Daisy (Pell James), is preggers; Shamus (Jack Huston), an Irish actor who is an alcoholic just for starters, and the actress Kate (Saffron Burrows), is a trophy wife who finds her husband's trophy shelf is not yet complete. These characters are intriguing in their own ways, especially when we sense Williams restraining himself from bolting headlong into his descriptions of sexual improbabilities, but each one is essentially a walk-on act, and even when their lifelines cross it seems an event in the screenplay, not their lives. One actress who does create a free-standing character is Keke Palmer (Jemma), mourning her mother, finding refuge in the movie revivals she attends as a form of escape. Palmer was the young star of \"Akeelah and the Bee\" (2006), and is still only 16; remember her name. Directing emotional traffic amid these problems, the Spacey character is coming to pieces. His wife has recently committed suicide, he can barely focus on his clients, and although he's excellent at spotting addiction in others, he rationalizes his own. It takes his father (Robert Loggia) to talk straight to him, and he is stunned to find himself the recipient of an intervention. Working within the range we frequently find him, Kevin Spacey is a master. Yes, there is a pattern to many of his roles, but there are characters he is suited to and others that would be improbable. Many critics find fault with him for not repeating \"American Beauty\" in every film, or maybe even for making it in the first place. I sense an acute intelligence at work. When he found few interesting Hollywood projects, he went to the London stage, took over management of the Old Vic, and reinvented himself. Why are some critics snarky toward such an actor? Is it the price they pay for trying? That said, \"Shrink\" contains ideas for a film, but no emotional center. A group of troubled characters are assembled and allowed to act out, not to much purpose. Jemma, the young girl, is the most authentic, and Henry relates to her most movingly. Two actors have found something to dig into. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "The Impossible", "Review": "The tsunami that devastated the Pacific Basin in the winter of 2004 remains one of the worst natural disasters in history. Although I assumed its climax, as shown in Clint Eastwood\u2019s film \u201cHereafter\u201d (2010), would never be surpassed, that was before I had seen \u201cThe Impossible.\u201d Here is a searing film of human tragedy. We were London in 2004 when the disaster struck, and later we sat mesmerized in Biarritz, watching the news on television. Again and again, the towering wall of water rose from the sea, tossing trucks, buses and its helpless victims aside. Surely this was a blow from hell. Advertisement The victims in Eastwood\u2019s film beheld it afar on home video. In director Juan Antonio Bayona\u2019s \u201cThe Impossible,\u201d they seem lost in it, engulfed by it, damned by it. As \u201cThe Impossible\u201d begins, all is quiet at a peaceful resort beach in Thailand. Seconds later, victims are swept up like matchsticks. The film is dominated by human figures: a young British couple, Maria and Henry Bennett (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor), and their three young sons, Lucas, Simon and Thomas (Tom Holland, Oaklee Pendergast and Samuel Joslin). All five fear they will never see their loved ones again. In the earlier Eastwood film, they seem the victims of cruel destiny singling out a fate, perhaps foretold. In the Bayona film, have they been doomed by destiny? Seated in a dark theater, I reached out my hand for that of my wife\u2019s. She and I had visited the same beach and discussed visiting it with our children and grandchildren. An icy finger ran slowly down our spines. Such a connection can be terrifying. What does it mean? We are the playthings of the gods. As the film\u2019s heroine, Naomi Watts powerfully becomes a front-runner for an Academy Award. Its eldest young hero, Lucas (Holland), separated from all, seeks tirelessly for fellow family members. How did anyone possibly survive? It takes a lot of courage for the little boy to bravely try to help others. Spoilers follow, although the trailer and TV commercials reveal many of them. I\u2019m happy I was blindsided by the story. We meet the Bennetts aboard a flight beginning their family holiday in Khao Lak, Thailand. We almost feel, rather than hear, a deeply alarming shift in the atmosphere. Something is fundamentally wrong. We see the tsunami from the tourists\u2019 point of view. There is a shift in the universe, leaving behind a dazed group whose world is a jumble of destruction. They wander through the wreckage. Advertisement Maria is terrifyingly knocked through a glass wall and realizes she can see her son Lucas\u2019 tiny head and body struggling to stay afloat in the surging flood waters. With indomitable strength and courage, she clings to debris, and they find themselves in a makeshift hospital that seems to have been somehow cobbled together. We realize she is the most seriously injured and begins to drift into and out of consciousness. She is a medical doctor and applies emergency first aid to herself. Henry, tough and plucky, screams out the names of his two younger sons and loads them onto a truck bound for higher ground. The geographical layout miraculously seems halfway familiar to us after dozens of hours of cable news. All of those YouTube videos uploaded by strangers have been populated by characters we think of as people we know. The film\u2019s most dramatic sequences focus on Lucas, assigning himself the role of his mother\u2019s lifeguard and protector. Now again, at another holiday season, this film becomes a powerful story of a family\u2019s cohesive strength.  Director Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez combine visual effects in this film that are doubly effective because they strive to do their job without calling undue attention. It is a mark of great acting in a film when it succeeds in accomplishing what it must precisely when it is required. \u201cThe Impossible\u201d is one of the best films of the year."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Alps", "Review": "\"Alps\" is a film peculiar beyond all understanding, based on a premise that begs belief. It takes itself with agonizing seriousness, and although it has the form of a parable, I am at a loss to guess its meaning. Yet I was drawn hypnotically into the weirdness. Imagine a small group of therapists who call themselves \"The Alps.\" They have been named by their leader, who explains that the title has no meaning. They hire themselves to people who have just lost loved ones. They impersonate those dead people as a way of bringing comfort to the bereaved. They don't necessarily look like the dead ones or sound like them, but they stand in for them a few hours a week, performing memorized dialogue that has presumably been supplied by the survivors. Advertisement Preposterous, will you agree? And yet their clients hire them and go along with the therapy. Not a single person in the film points out the absurdity of its premise. We don't get to know the clients very well, but we watch the Alps members as they train in an empty gymnasium. In particular, we follow a gymnast (Ariane Labed) and her trainer (Johnny Vekris), as they work on a routine involving her dancing with a long ribbon fluttering at the end of a baton. She does this (very well) to classical music, but when she asks to change to pop music, he tells her he will bash in her face if she questions his authority. We find it is no idle threat. This brutal relationship has no apparent connection with the grief therapy of the Alps, which otherwise consists largely of memorizing dialogue. Early in the film, a young tennis player (Maria Kirozi) is gravely injured in a car crash, and we learn that the paramedic is a talent scout of sorts, seeking likely victims who might supply Alps customers. Team member Monte Rosa (Aggeliki Papoulia) calls dibs on the tennis player; later she deceives the other Alps by claiming the player has recovered, and then taking on the parents as private clients. How she behaves in this role confirms what we may have suspected, that being an Alps member and doing the job requires a degree of mental imbalance and can lead to therapists spinning out of control because of the tension between who they are and the job they're required to do. \"Alps\" is the new film by the Greek director Giorgos Lanthimos, whose \"Dogtooth\" shook up Cannes in 2009. That was the film where control-freak parents contain their children within a walled garden and further isolate them from the world by teaching them the incorrect words for things. A Lanthimos film is like a test tube for life, in which the activity depends on what specific ingredients have been introduced. Although \"Alps\" is provocative and challenging, it is so completely self-contained that it has no particular emotional payoff. There is no greater world in which to evaluate its contents. When mourners are comforted by therapists who propose to represent the loved one, you'd think deep feelings would be stirred up. But \"Alps\" has the effect of a sterile exercise. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "My Scientology Movie", "Review": "The personal pronoun in the title of \u201cMy Scientology Movie\u201d makes sense in more ways than one. For the current era, Alex Gibney\u2019s authoritatively damning \u201cGoing Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\u201d is likely to remain the movie about the pseudo-scientific mind control cult that calls itself the \u201creligion\u201d of Scientology. This Louis Theroux-starring film belongs to the Michael Moore school of docu-making, in which much hinges on the personal viewpoint and observational wit of the on-camera investigator. Advertisement American viewers familiar with the documentaries of Nick Broomfield may find those provide an apt point of comparison for \u201cMy Scientology Movie,\u201d although Broomfield is an actual documentary filmmaker while Theroux (son of writer Paul) is the species of TV personality that Brits call a \u201cpresenter.\u201d He has a weekend show on the BBC, that is, and when he arrives in Los Angeles to launch his own investigation into Scientology, the film\u2019s tone suggests that it is aimed at viewers already familiar with his low-key comic persona. For Americans previously unfamiliar with Theroux, however, this presents at most only a temporary barrier, because his unassuming humor quickly establishes him as a narrator worth listening to. He\u2019s also one with a clearly stated goal that sets us up for the droll chagrin that follows. For years, Theroux confesses, he had hoped to make a film that would discover a more positive side to Scientology than the countless negative images projected in the media. Needless to say, this film (directed by John Dower) doesn\u2019t end up being the first flattering documentary about Scientology made by an outsider\u2014not that Theroux, of course, probably ever thought it would. Early on, he sketches in the cult\u2019s well-known history, from being founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the \u201850s to how, after Hubbard\u2019s death, control of the organization passed to an impeccably tailored but consummately creepy little authoritarian named David Miscavige. Theroux serves up TV clips from Scientology rallies of recent years, where Miscavige and the torrents of worship washing over him resemble nothing so much as the cult of the Great Leader in North Korea. Except that Kim Jong Un doesn\u2019t have Tom Cruise bounding on stage to lend his support to the idolatrous acclamation that Scientology\u2019s leader commands. Advertisement For much of the movie, Theroux drives a rent-a-car around Los Angeles and its environs, looking at Scientology locations and talking to people who have escaped the cult\u2019s grip about its byzantine doctrines and practices. Scientologists profess to believe that humans are ancient cosmic souls who must reincarnate endlessly until they free themselves from negative thought patterns. The effort to do that is behind the group\u2019s use of \u201cE-meters,\u201d which supposedly help members release the debilitating thought forms. But this involves an hierarchical organizational structure and an elaborate, multi-year process that can cost members hundreds of thousands of dollars. Scientology maintains its power through secrecy and intimidation, and Theroux gets a view of both when he visits the group\u2019s notorious \u201cGold Base\u201d in Riverside, California, a sprawling rural enclave that\u2019s surrounded by high walls and a phalanx of security cameras. Needless to say, our intrepid reporter doesn\u2019t make it inside, but he gets to film Scientologists\u2019 cameras filming him as its security people come out and demand that he leaves. Of course, this is an easy contrivance on the director's part: Theroux and company know they\u2019ll be turned away in this manner, as have many before them. And similar things occur in other circumstances, most comically when they\u2019re filmed twice by a cameraman who claims to be just a freelance shooter-for-hire but won\u2019t identify his employer. Because the Scientologists react so reflexively and predictably\u2014as they do in threatening emails to Theroux\u2014it makes you wonder if they\u2019ve learned nothing in decades of dealing with media that have long ago figured out how to bait them. Among the Scientology apostates that Theroux interviews, some of the most vivid testimony comes from former Scientology Quartermaster General Marty Rathbun, who describes Miscavige\u2019s hysterical rants and violence against his underlings. Rathbun also participates in the film\u2019s most productive contrivance, when Theroux sets up auditions for actors to play the parts of Miscavige and Cruise in a fictionalized probe into the Scientology story. The young performers are very game for their task, and some go deep into the dark emotions that Rathbun describes. The two eventually chosen to embody the Great Leader and his Movie-star Acolyte (whose way of staring is carefully examined) are eerily good at playing men who sometimes seem not altogether human. Advertisement While \"My Scientology Movie\" provides a very entertaining tour of some of the questions that swirl around Scientology, viewers who\u2019ve followed the story through the years will find little that\u2019s new or unexpected. A number of interesting issues are touched on not at all or only tangentially. For example, we hear nothing about recent reports that the Scientology ranks are rapidly aging since the influx of new recruits has slowed dramatically. Yet we get a hint of this late in the film where a small posse of members show up at the soundstage where Theroux is shooting. Their efforts to intimidate are dulled by the fact that they all look well past 60\u2014a sign, perhaps, that the cult may not last much past Miscavige\u2019s passing, if that long."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Love & Mercy", "Review": "The most heartening surprise about director Bill Pohlad\u2019s\r\n\u201cLove and Mercy\u201d is also to my mind a pretty improbable one. That is, that it\u2019s\r\nsuch a good and at times better than good movie. The rise and fall and rise and\r\nfall and rise of genius musician Brian Wilson, a life story that disproves\r\nFitzgerald\u2019s adage about there being no second acts in America in what seems like\r\nthe most perverse way imaginable, looks on paper to be too sprawling, too\r\nchaotic, to be distilled into a coherent, never mind compelling, cinematic\r\nnarrative of conventional length.  Advertisement But longtime producer Pohlad (\u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d \u201c12\r\nYears A Slave\u201d), working from a daring\r\nscript by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, and using two first-rate\r\nactors to play Wilson at two turning points in his life, lavishes his material\r\nwith love, attention to detail, and empathetic imagination. The result is a\r\nstory that\u2019s hair-raisingly watchable and frequently moving, regardless of what\r\nyou believe you might already know of Wilson\u2019s life.  The movie shuttles back and forth between two distinct\r\nperiods. In the mid \u201860s, Paul Dano\u2019s Wilson is the baby-faced\r\nmusical genius of the Beach Boys who\u2019s burning out on the road life. He\u2019s got\r\nthis amazing music in his head, and he manages to get quite a bit of it out,\r\ndespite the resentful sniping of his abusive ex-manager father, the hostility\r\nof at least one bandmate who doesn\u2019t get why Brian isn\u2019t writing more hits, and\r\nan increasingly fragile psychic state that is not helped by an exposure to LSD.\r\nCusack plays the Wilson of the late '80s, supposedly brought back from a\r\ncomplete psychotic break by psychological miracle worker Dr. Eugene Landy, who\r\nbecame such a part of Wilson\u2019s life that he presumed to make himself a partner\r\nin the creation of Wilson\u2019s music. John Cusack\u2019s Wilson wanders desultorily\r\ninto a Cadillac dealership (although we soon see he\u2019s got a bodyguard trailing\r\nhim, and a mini-entourage trailing the bodyguard), charms attractive young\r\nsalesperson Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), who at first has no idea who the sweetly\r\neccentric fellow is. After telling her he wants the car in which they\u2019ve stolen\r\na few precious moments removed from the outside world, he scrawls on her\r\nbusiness card and leaves it on the steering wheel of the car. The words he\u2019s\r\nwritten are \u201cLonely/Frightened/Scared.\u201d Landy, played with terrifying intensity and smarm by Paul\r\nGiamatti, has by this point in time morphed from someone in service of Wilson\r\nto a malignant Svengali. His monstrous manipulations are bad enough in\r\nisolation, but when intercut with scenes of the younger Wilson shrinking at the\r\ndisapprobation of the father\u2014who beat him to deafness in one ear, but from whom Brian still craves approval\u2014or the\r\ncousin/bandmate who hectors him over jokey song lyrics and musical direction,\r\nthey are genuinely heart-rending and angering. The movie creates a rather\r\neffective suspense story: as Melinda gets closer and closer to Brian, under\r\nLandy\u2019s paranoid gaze, one wonders just how much fortitude Mr. Wilson\u2019s new\r\nlove interest has, and if she has that fortitude, can she get what she needs to\r\ndeliver Brian from what he describes as his \u201chell.\u201d It gets pretty tense.  Meanwhile, back in the \u201860s, Pohlad and Dano and a host of excellent supporting players simulate the creation of such ground-breaking pop works as Pet Sounds and \u201cGood Vibrations.\u201d Usually fictionalized scenes of music-making are as convincing as cinematic depictions of painters painting (that is, not at all), so the very compelling scenes in which young Brian corrals the crack L.A. session players known as \u201cThe Wrecking Crew\u201d into accepting and then conjuring his sometimes eccentric musical visions feel almost miraculous. And Banks, who brings equal notes of beauty-queen sunniness and Girl Scout rectitude to her portrayal of Melinda (who did, spoiler alert, become Mrs. Wilson after the events depicted in this film) has an interesting chemistry with the haltingly charming and sometimes tragically wrung-out Cusack. Advertisement \n The movie isn\u2019t perfect: the hairpiece Giamatti sports throughout is so unconvincing that the filmmakers ought to have found away to make a joke of it. But even when Pohlad puts a foot wrong, he does so in an interesting way. This isn\u2019t the kind of movie in which you expect to find a resonating allusion to \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d and yet there one is. And while I have to say it didn\u2019t quite work for me, I\u2019ve got to give Pohlad credit for nerve. In any event, there\u2019s more than enough of real value in the movie in spite of that. Not just its content, but its bedrock belief in people, in spite of all the awful things people can do. This philosophy is also a big part of Wilson\u2019s music, a point that\u2019s brought home as the end titles roll."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Two Trains Runnin'", "Review": "\u201cTwo Trains Runnin\u2019\u201d intermingles two completely unrelated non-fiction threads which converge in the state of Mississippi on June 21, 1964, One of them is triumphant, the other tragic. One is a well-known story, the other is a mystery whose outcome is not so well-known. Both sections feature idealistic, college-aged White men from the North whose quests could not have been more different: One group came to the segregated South looking for music while the other sought justice. Those Holy Grails are by no means equivalent, but director Samuel D. Pollard and his editor, Dava Whisenant, expertly weave these two threads into a thematically rich whole cloth. Hidden similarities emerge as \u201cTwo Trains Runnin\u2019\u201d rides towards its final destination. Advertisement \u201cThe US was a segregated nation at the time,\u201d Phil Spiro tells us when we first hear his voice on the soundtrack. \u201cBut I was a prototypical White college kid at MIT, so it didn\u2019t impact me very much.\u201d This would explain why he, and two other people he recruited, would venture into Mississippi to search for an obscure blues musician who hadn\u2019t recorded in 30 years. Unbeknownst to Spiro, Mississippi had a reputation as not only the most racist state in the Union, but also the least welcoming to outsiders of any hue. This was the year of the Freedom Summer. People were coming into the state to register Black voters, which was seen by Mississippians as the next wave of Northern Aggression. If you were a White out-of-towner, the residents would think you were planning to, in their words, \u201cmess with our Nigras.\u201d Spiro and company had no such agenda, but three Jewish guys in a Volkswagen with New York license plates were definitely going to raise the eyebrows under a Mississippi state trooper\u2019s hat. Spiro\u2019s love of old Delta Blues records from the 1920\u2019s and 1930\u2019s was enough to get him to quit MIT and take a job coding for one of the world\u2019s first computers. The gig allowed his nights to be free to pursue his musical obsession, Son House, a contemporary of Robert Johnson whose records were so powerful they gave Spiro goosebumps. Acting solely on a hot tip regarding House\u2019s whereabouts that he received from a recently found blues musician named Booker White, Spiro went to Mississippi. He was accompanied by Dick Waterman, a journalist whose paper would publish the story if House was found, and Nick Perls, a guy who has a car, a tape recorder and a lot more money than Spiro anticipated. Perls is rich enough to live above a gallery of expensive art works. While Waterman and Spiro have difficulty putting into words just what drew them to not only Son House\u2019s music, but to the Delta blues music of the era, African-American author Greg Tate offers us a theory: \u201cIt spoke to another way of life that was more expressive, more erotic, more dangerous.\u201d And yet, as many of the blues performers in \u201cTwo Trains Runnin\u2019\u201d point out, these Depression-era blues musicians were quite often singing about universal things like money and relationship problems. It only seemed exotic when viewed from within the bubble of privilege Spiro alludes to in his opening lines of dialogue. Advertisement At the same time Spiro\u2019s Volkswagen was leaving New York City, John Fahey, another blues-loving musician, left California en route to find a musician named Skip James. James was reportedly even bigger and badder than Son House\u2014he played guitar and piano and his songs were rough and dark. Fahey was the more experienced of the two musician hunters, having been to Mississippi previously on one of these missions. Fahey went to Bentonia, Mississippi, not too far from where Spiro will eventually wind up. \u201cTwo Trains Runnin\u2019\u201d documents these journeys with excellent animated sequences. They\u2019re flawlessly integrated with the talking heads and the newsreel footage, and are just as compelling. One scene, involving a Black musician and a truckload of White field workers, is exceptionally tense despite it being rendered as a cartoon. Spiro and Fahey discovered the whereabouts of their musicians on Mississippi on June 21, 1964, the same day Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, two White college students like Spiro, disappeared in Philadelphia, Mississippi, along with African-American fellow activist James Chaney. Their bodies were found six weeks later, causing nationwide outrage. Robert Moses and David Dennis, the organizers of the Mississippi Summer Project to register voters, appear onscreen to speak about this tragedy, and how it brought attention to the ugliness of the Jim Crow South. Pollard\u2019s inclusion of Dennis choking up while discussing his lost charges is more powerful than the misguided and infuriating 1988 Alan Parker film, \u201cMississippi Burning,\" which dramatized the same events. Narrated by rapper Common, \u201cTwo Trains Runnin\u2019\u201d intercuts its stories with blues musicians singing and discussing Delta Blues songs. The musicians are young and old, Black and White, male and female, and all extremely talented. The songs become the glue that binds the movie\u2019s seemingly disparate halves. When the stories converge, \u201cTwo Trains Runnin\u2019\u201d becomes a powerful meditation on the origins of an African-American musical genre and the painful reasons for its existence. The Freedom Summer exposed an otherwise cocooned America to why musicians like Son House and Skip James would sing the songs they did. Advertisement I\u2019ve reviewed a lot of movies like this here at RogerEbert.com, and every time I wish I've could done so from a place where their stories existed as time capsules rather than reminders of how little has changed. Pollard brings last year\u2019s Voting Rights Act changes into the film not only as a workable thematic connection but also as a warning. Someone in \u201cTwo Trains Runnin\u2019\u201d points out that in order for things to evolve, the people who aren\u2019t affected by the problem need to be enlightened and enlisted for the cause. I felt a lot more optimistic about this message when I saw this film in October than when I saw it again very recently, but that doesn\u2019t diminish its power. Pollard\u2019s choice to end with a stirring a capella number by Son House still provided the uplift needed to fight another day."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Dark Night", "Review": "There's a scene in \"Dark Night\" where a young woman sits on a curb with police lights washing over her; a tight closeup of one of her eyeballs makes it seem as if the orb is light from within by red and blue. There's also a very long lateral tracking shot in the film of a surly young man walking past a chain link fence, and the diamond pattern of the chain link strobes and flashes as he walks. There's a tight closeup of the eyes of another young man, this one with close-cropped hair, staring while the soundtrack erupts with the sound of photographers' flashbulbs going off and reporters shouting questions, then the movie cuts to a shot from behind the young man's head as he stands in a backyard staring at a house. \"Dark Night\" has a shot of a parking lot and an adjacent road that swivels and zooms like a Google Earth map, and long static takes of people looking at things: malls; televisions; their own images in the screens of cell phones. Advertisement \"Dark Night\" is a film about the 2012 Aurora massacre, by the way.  Well, not exactly.  It doesn't replicate any details leading up to the shooting itself, in which a heavily armed and deeply disturbed young man with a shock of dyed-red hair burst into a multiplex theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" set off tear gas grenades, and killed 12 people and injured 70. Rather, it is a film about the conditions that led to the massacre. Okay, it's not that either. It's a quasi-experimental drama, shot in Sarasota, Florida with a nonprofessional cast, about the culture of isolation that contributes to the culture of ... Sorry, the alienated nature of the self-image in the age of social media and ... Well, no. No, not that either. What, then? That's a major demerit when a film tries to deal with material this complex and wrenching. \"Dark Night\" is directed by Tim Sutton, who made the musical drama \"Memphis\" in the same vein. It is photographed by the great French cinematographer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louvart with deep knowledge of what light does to faces and to the textures of walls and furniture and skin, and edited by Jeanne Applegate in an elliptical, austere style. If skill alone were a determinant of quality, this would be a four-star classic.  But I've seen this film twice and I'm just not convinced it's all that interested in the subjects it claims to be interested in. And that's a deal-breaker of a problem. My friend Greg Cwik's article about the gun culture of the former Confederate states\u00a0rings more true to me than anything in \"Dark Night,\" and has a lot more substantive things to say about Sutton's subject matter than Sutton does. Interestingly, Sutton has cited Gus Van Sant's \"Elephant,\" a similarly opaque, eerily beautiful feature about the Columbine massacre, as a key inspiration. Not too many people besides film buffs remember this, but Van Sant drew some criticism for treating Columbine, then America's bloodiest gun massacre, as raw material for a series of elegant tracking shots and lovingly composed images of good-looking teenagers. But compared to \"Dark Night,\" \"Elephant\" seems like a model of caution and exactness. The movie has a great eye and a great ear but I didn't sense any soul in it, much less an authentic emotional or intellectual connection to the event that inspired it. The chronological games and elliptical editing deny you insight into any particular character. That means that when you look into the eyes of a certain character and wonder if that character will turn out to be the shooter, you have no solid information with which to make an educated guess.  Advertisement The idea of structuring a moody, indirect art house drama so that you spend the whole film guessing which character is going to gun down a lot of people is problematic in its own way. It turns murder into a cinematic game. I doubt the filmmakers meant to do that, and would probably be horrified to see their work written about in that way, but absent of any sense of psychology\u2014a sense that the characters have been thought about as human beings rather than as objects to be posed, directed and photographed\u2014that's what comes across. Like the brilliant \"Cameraperson,\" and such image-driven, free-associative documentaries as \"Koyaanisqatsi,\" but lacking in precision and focus, not to mention actual ideas that inspire a reaction besides \"Huh,\" it's the kind of movie where both meaning and importance are imposed from without. Watching it cold is a bit like regarding an abstract painting in a gallery and not having any particular response to it until you read the little placard on the wall, then think, \"Oh, right, yes, the relationship between red and brown expresses the inevitability of decay.\"  Sometimes the sound is out of sync, sometimes a scene goes silent for a long time, sometimes you spend a long time looking at people through doorways that hide them. These are counter-intuitive, even audacious directorial choices, but they feel too much like riffs, and I don't believe a movie about this subject should be so coy and playful. The decisions to have one of the male characters dye his hair orange like the Aurora shooter and briefly show footage of the real life killer on a TV screen cross the line into sickening. The movie is borrowing momentousness from Aurora to make us think it has something to say about the forces that created Aurora. Advertisement It's one thing to make a movie that peers at its subject from around  corners and behind trees and fences and shows you the outline of the thing but not  the thing itself, creating a sort of absent presence\u2014a sense of existential dread that plugs straight into the heart of 21st century American alienation and gun violence. It's quite another  to make a movie like this one, which seems to be playing games with us  to no defensible end, and succeeds mainly in impressing the viewer with  the film's production values and atmosphere and use of negative space.  At its prettiest and most self-indulgent, it plays like a cinematographer's reel with a  massacre at the end."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Cesar Chavez", "Review": "Farm worker organizer and union activist Cesar Chavez today is a man with many streets named after him but little purchase on the public memory, outside, perhaps, of the Latino community. So it's understandable that filmmakers would want to dramatize a life and career that were not only politically potent but inspirational to many. Unfortunately, \"Cesar Chavez,\" directed by Mexican actor Diego Luna, commits the classic sin of biopics about storied leaders: it's reverential rather than revealing, predictably admiring where it needs to be nuanced and challenging. Advertisement Biographies of Chavez paint a man who was complex and controversial even within his own circle, a natural leader who also made strategic mistakes that sometimes harmed his own cause. This is rich material for a movie. Yet \"Cesar Chavez\" regrettably gives us the historical man with all the rough edges sanded off, leaving a depiction that bears an uncomfortable resemblance to a plaster saint. Although the film concentrates on the period from 1965-1970, when Chavez led a strike of grape-farm workers that brought him into the national media glare, it begins by sketching the years before he landed on the cover of Time. Born in Arizona of Mexican descent, he labors as a farm worker after his family moves to California. By his mid-20s he's working as an organizer for the Community Service Organization, a Latino civil rights group, when the hard conditions faced by farm workers compels him to move his young family to a farming community to take up the cause. One of the first challenges facing him is the antipathy between Filipino and Latino workers. Making the case that the owners always pit different ethnic groups against each other, Chavez (Michael Pe\u00f1a) succeeds in forging an alliance. Throughout, he urges non-violence even in situations where the angry owners aren't hesitant to employ goons and firearms. After organizing the workers, with the help of activist Dolores Huerta (Rosario Dawson), he leads a march on Sacramento that draws national attention, and launches a boycott of California grapes that's taken up by consumers across the country. Eventually Chavez gains a powerful ally in Senator Robert F. Kennedy (Jack Holmes), who comes to California while engaged in congressional hearings. Despite his growing fame, the union leader risks both his health and his credibility by undertaking a hunger strike. And after Kennedy's assassination, Chavez faces a much chillier political climate when anti-union leaders like Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon hold sway in the U.S. While Keir Pearson and Timothy J. Sexton's script chronicles these events in a very straightforward, sometimes numbingly literalistic fashion, it also leaves too much unclear. When the farm workers go on strike, what exactly are they demanding? What kinds of wage increases or improved conditions? A little specificity in the details of these struggles would have helped viewers understand them far better, which in turn would have helped them feel less generalized and more genuinely dramatic. Advertisement But the script's vagueness is most problematic when it comes to the movie's central figure. How did Chavez come by his pacifistic convictions and tactics? Was he influenced by Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. or his own Catholic upbringing? Did his colleagues in the movement ever challenge him with their own ideas rather than just accepting his? None of this do we ever learn in \"Cesar Chavez,\" which presents its hero as a fully-formed wise man rather than a complicated, growing individual who learns from others and from his own difficult experiences. Ironically, the film's most arresting character is Chavez's political opposite number, a sneering right-wing grower named Bogdonovitch, who's played with pungently malevolent gusto by John Malkovich. You don't need a press kit to deduce that this man is a \"composite\"\u2013i.e., fictional\u2013character. The moviemakers faced the choice between inventing their villain or facing a lawsuit from a real-life miscreant, no doubt, and they made the obvious choice. But the result is that Bogdonovitch and Chavez seem like they belong in two different movies. One has all the vividness and density of potent fiction, where the other is as pallid and dimensionless as a news brief. Some of this, of course, has to do with the acting. While Luna proves an able director in mounting scenes in a fluidly realistic manner and flavorfully evoking the story's mostly rural period settings (in which California is played by Mexico), he also must share blame for the blandness of Chavez's portrayal. An extremely capable and appealing actor in most circumstances, Michael Pe\u00f1a here seems both hemmed in and weighed down by the halo that's almost visible above his head. His work feels predetermined where it needs to be probing, respectful where it needs riskiness. Advertisement The shame of this is that \"Cesar Chavez\" comes off as a wasted opportunity precisely because it does successfully return us to an era of important political change. Once upon a time, ordinary white housewives heeded the call of a Latino union leader and boycotted California agricultural products to the point of forcing an industry to change its labor practices. Would such a thing be possible today, and if not, why not? The film inevitably sends viewers away with such questions stirring in their minds. Yet its final failing is that it does nothing to connect those long-ago events and today, when Latinos are a far more influential politically and immigration and farm labor are still hot-button issues. It's too content to let the history lesson it gives us remain only that: history."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Me Before You", "Review": "In this romantic drama, based on a best-seller by a female author that has been devoured by hordes of female readers, a filthy-rich 30-ish man who has shut down his emotions forms a relationship with a fetchingly unsophisticated, younger woman of modest means who is willing to tend to his needs. What starts off as strictly a business proposition eventually grows into a more personal and cozier connection. Quick, name the movie. You and your dirty mind are probably thinking \u201cFifty Shades of Grey,\u201d right? Now think again and replace the explicit kink with lovey-dovey canoodling and all that bondage gear with a wheelchair. What you have is \u201cMe Before You,\u201d an exercise not in S&M marathons but an almost completely chaste wallow in sob cinema, the Hollywood prototype of which is \u201cLove Story.\u201d Advertisement Luckily, many of the plot\u2019s maudlin pitfalls are greatly mitigated by the film\u2019s utterly infectious leading lady. Emilia Clarke\u2019s performance is winningly immersed in charming gawkiness and heartfelt sincerity while sporting a deliriously kitschy wardrobe heavy on eye-popping primary colors and loud butterfly prints. So much so, it might put you in mind of when you first witnessed the blinding incandescence of Julia Roberts' widescreen-ready smile or the delicate allure of Keira Knightley\u2019s cameo-locket features.\u00a0 Of course, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d devotees have long been bowing down before this British actress and her impressive display of bewitching bad-assery as the silver-haired dragon-keeper Daenerys Targaryen. But she hasn\u2019t quite broken through on the big screen yet. Instead, she proved all too capable of being as forgettable as anything else in last summer\u2019s \u201cTerminator Genisys\u201d as the young Sarah Connor. But only those who are allergic to adorable clumsiness and dewy-eyed sincerity will be able to resist Clarke as Louisa, a sheltered small-town girl with a big personality, too few ambitions and deep concerns for her family\u2019s economic welfare. She even has a unique secret weapon: A set of incredible dancing eyebrows that appear to be under the spell of a snake charmer. We all should be thankful\u2014save, perhaps, those who voted her\u00a0Esquire\u2019s Sexiest Woman Alive last year\u2014that Clarke turned down starring in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d (too much nudity) and waited for this opportunity. To be fair, there of echoes of many other more edifying sources\u2014\u201cAn Affair to Remember,\u201d \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d the French import \u201cThe Intouchables\u201d\u2014that reverberate through this \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d fantasy as it unfolds in a quaint English village. That the struggling working-class town\u2019s picturesque views are dominated by a massive castle further enhance the sense that this is a contemporary fairy tale. Advertisement Ensconced in said fortress in his own stylish yet sterile bachelor pad cocoon is 30-ish Will Traynor, who once was a dashing financial whiz, devotee of extreme sports and bon vivant lover of ravishing women before he was left a quadriplegic two years earlier after a traffic accident. As played by Sam Claflin (Finnick Odair in \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d franchise), Will is initially toxic, filled with resentfulness and bitterness over losing his once-wonderful life. He also struggles with chronic pain and finds little joy in existing anymore. That begins to slowly\u2014very slowly\u2014change once lovely Lou enters his world, after being hired by his concerned mother (Janet McTeer of \u201cAlbert Nobbs,\u201d adding what layers she can to an underdone part) and father (played by a Charles Dance, a few degrees warmer than usual). Lou is supposedly a caretaker, although she soon discovers that there is an affable male nurse about to handle the more medical-related and personal hygiene concerns. Instead, she is intended to be a ray of sunshine to dispel the storm clouds that lend to their son\u2019s sagging spirits and boost his desire to live. With a considerable arsenal of withering sarcastic retorts at his surly disposal, Will puts up quite a defense. But one rainy day, he decides to watch a French DVD\u2014\u201cOf Gods and Men,\u201d about Trappist monks living in war-torn Algeria\u2014and the ice between him and Lou begins to melt after he learns she has never seen a subtitled movie before. There are some roadblocks that aren\u2019t as easy to overcome\u2014such as Lou\u2019s clearly incompatible long-distance-runner beau and the fact that Will learns his pre-accident girlfriend is engaged to marry one of his best friends. Then a rather dire agenda of Will\u2019s is revealed, one that will not be exposed here though it is unfortunately treated with all the ham-fisted tentativeness of the worst of those Nicholas Sparks adaptations. This causes Lou to double down on making Will happy by taking him to Mozart concerts, heading to the racetrack and going on a swoony trip to Mallorca. Do they fall for each other? Mais oui. Advertisement But weep porn does what weep porn must, even though\u2014unlike my excessive waterworks during \"The Fault in\u00a0Our Stars\"\u2014I found no need to dip into the promo Kleenex handed out at my screening. First-time filmmaker Thea Sharrock does an able job keeping us invested in her two main characters while punching up their emotions with Ed Sheeran and Imagine Dragons on the soundtrack and serving up some tasty supporting characters such as Brendan Coyle of \"Downton Abbey\"\u00a0fame as Lou\u2019s dad and Joanna Lumley of \"Absolutely Fabulous\"\u00a0acclaim as an uncensored wedding guest. But given that the film\u2019s catchphrase is \u201cLive boldly!,\u201d it\u2019s a shame that \"Me Before You\"\u00a0didn\u2019t take a bolder and more honest route in its adaptation of the novel by Jojo Moyes, who also wrote the screenplay. Still, if this flick helps Clarke get ahead in the movie biz, it has done at least one thing right."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Gone Baby Gone", "Review": "Boston seems like the most forbidding city in crime movies. There are lots of movies about criminals in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and points between, but somehow in Boston the wounds cut deeper, the characters are angrier, their resentments bleed, their grudges never die, and they all know everybody else's business. The novelist Dennis Lehane captured that dour gloom in his books inspiring \"Mystic River\" and now \"Gone Baby Gone.\" What would it take to make his characters happy? This is his fourth story involving Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), lovers and business partners, who are private investigators specializing in tracking down deadbeats. Approached by clients who have deadly matters on their mind, Patrick and Angie protest that they're just garden-variety PIs, don't carry guns, aren't looking for heavy lifting. Then somehow they end up with crucifixion murders, kidnapped babies and, as always, people who are not who, or what, they seem. Advertisement This could become a franchise, if we didn't start grinning at their claims to be basically amateurs. In \"Gone Baby Gone,\" Ben Affleck, making his debut as a director, assumes we haven't read the four novels, approaches Patrick and Angie head on and surrounds them with a gallery of very, very intriguing characters. He has his brother Casey and Monaghan play babes in the deep, dark woods, their youth and inexperience working for them as they wonder about what veteran cops don't question. The result is a superior police procedural, and something more -- a study in devious human nature. I know, the title sounds like the movie should star Bill Haley and the Comets. But there is a rough authenticity from the first shots, especially when we meet a woman named Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) and her husband Lionel (Titus Welliver), who don't think the cops are doing enough to track down her 4-year-old niece. They think people who know the neighborhood and don't wear badges might find out more. They're right. The police investigation is being led by Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) of the Crimes Against Children police task force, who unlike a standard movie cop, doesn't resent these outsiders but suggests they work with his men Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton). Not likely, but good for the story, as the trail begins in the wreckage of a life being lived by the little girl's single mother, Helene (Amy Ryan). She is deep into drugs, which she takes whenever she can sober up enough, and there seems to be a connection between her supplier and a recent heist of a pile of drug money. Enough about the plot. What I like about the movie is the way Ben Affleck and his brother, both lifelong Bostonians, understand the rhythm of a society in which people not only live in one another's pockets but are trying to slash their way out. This movie and the recent \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\"\u00a0announce Casey's maturation as an actor, and it also proves, after her film \"The Heartbreak Kid,\" (2007) that Michelle Monaghan should not be blamed for the sins of others. And when you assemble Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Amy Madigan and Amy Ryan as sidemen, the star soloists can go out for a cigarette, and the show goes right on. One reason crime movies tend to be intrinsically interesting is that the supporting characters have to be riveting. How far would Jason Bourne get in a one-man show? Advertisement There are some secrets and concealed motives in \"Gone Baby Gone,\" but there always are, in any crime movie without nametags saying Good Guy and Bad Guy. What distinguishes the screenplay by Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard, which departs from the novel in several ways, is (a) how well-concealed the secrets are, and (b) how much perfect sense they make when they're revealed. I am grateful when a movie springs something on me, and I feel rewarded, not tricked. I also like the way that certain clues are planted in plain view. We can see or hear them just fine. It's that we don't know they're clues. No glowering closeups or characters skulking in a corner to give the game away. That's a tribute to the writing -- and the acting, which doesn't telegraph anything. Actors talk about how well they like to get to know their characters. Sometimes it's better if they take them at face value and find out more about them along with the rest of us. There are dark regions below the surface of the story. Was the child taken by a pedophile? There's a suspect, all right, but maybe he's too obvious. Certainly Helene, the mother, is no help. She's so battered by drugs and drink that she's hardly quite sure if a conversation is taking place. It's amazing the little girl made it to 4; her aunt and uncle must have had a lot to do with that. The unspoken assumption is that somewhere a clock is ticking, and the longer the child remains missing, the more likely she will never be found or be found dead. And here are these two kids, skip tracers who have lives and destinies depending on them."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Potiche", "Review": "It has been years since I sensed that Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu were acting. They are, of course, and as a wide variety of characters. But they give their directors what Billy Wilder once asked Jack Lemmon to do: \"nothing.\" There is never a note wrong, never the slightest strain, always such an unforced ease in the sight of the camera that they might have been born onscreen.  Here they are in Francois Ozon's comedy \"Potiche.\" The title is a French word that combines aspects of \"trophy wife\" and \"status symbol.\" Here comes now the potiche, clad in a red running suit and jogging down a forest path: Suzanne (Deneuve), the bourgeois wife of a provincial factory owner.  Advertisement Her father created a factory that manufactures umbrellas. Her husband, Robert (Fabrice Luchini), became the boss after the old man's death. It appears that she brought the factory into their marriage, but Robert behaves as if he built it from the ground up with his own hands, one parapluie at a time. He is an arrogant man, the ruler of his little kingdom, who cheats on his fragrant wife with his secretary \u2014 who herself seems not very pleased by him. Suzanne lives a serene and comfortable life, loves her adult son and daughter, understands that her husband has a mistress and is perhaps happy to have the mistress relieve her of some of her duties. That Deneuve so convincingly inhabits this character is a demonstration of effortless skill. It is 1977. France is shaken by strikes. (I recall Cannes in those years, annually shut down for a day or two by striking workers who took their own strolls on the red carpet.) The workers go on strike at the umbrella factory, Robert marches out to denounce them, and they make him a hostage. Suddenly, all the labor problems have become the business of Suzanne. She has been depicted as just slightly bubble-brained. Suzanne carries around a little pocket notebook in which she writes little poems, which are more than a little banal. The method of Deneuve's approach to the role is not to pretend Suzanne becomes suddenly serious, but to show Suzanne as still exactly the same person, as only the circumstances change. She needs help. She calls upon the town mayor, Maurice (Gerard Depardieu). He is a communist, as many French mayors were at that time. He is also a fond man in late middle age, running a little to seed, who remembers Suzanne warmly from his past. (Their unforced onscreen affection must own something to the fact that they have appeared in eight films together and have lived in each other's pockets for decades as glories of the French cinema.) They work together to find a way past the stupidity of her husband and the anger of the workers. Along the way, Suzanne re-engages in life; we sense her strategy for dealing with her unbearable husband was to partition him into a soundproof room in her mind. \"Potiche\" is a whimsical comedy, based on a popular Parisian stage success of some years ago. It plays like one, although Ozon uses more locations than a play would find possible. There's little effort at psychological depth, and the characters float along on the requirements of comedy. But it's sweet comedy, knowing about human nature, and Deneuve and Depardieu, who bring so much history to the screen, seem to create it by their very natures. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Bug", "Review": "William Friedkin's latest film, \"Bug,\" begins as an ominous rumble of unease, and builds to a shriek. The last 20 minutes are searingly intense: A paranoid personality finds its mate, and they race each other into madness. For Friedkin, director of \"The Exorcist,\" it's a work of headlong passion.\rIts stars, Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon, achieve a kind of manic intensity that's frightening not just in itself but because you almost fear for the actors. They're working without a net. The film is based on a play by Tracy Letts, an actor and playwright at Chicago's Steppenwolf theater, that was a hit here and in New York. Advertisement In the film we meet Agnes (Judd), a waitress in a honky-tonk lesbian bar, living in a shabby motel. Her violent ex-husband (Harry Connick Jr.), just out on parole, walks back into her life, still violent. At about the same time her gay friend R.C. (Lynn Collins) drags in a stray with haunted eyes. This is the polite stranger named Peter (Shannon) who says he doesn't want sex or anything else, is attentive and courteous, and is invited by Agnes to spend the night even though he seems (to us) like the embodiment of menace.\rThe story involves this man's obsession with bugs that he believes infect his cells and may have been implanted by the government during his treatment for obscure causes after military service in the Gulf. We think he's crazy. Agnes listens and nods, and doesn't want him to leave; she feels safer around him.\rHe begins to seem more weird. This doesn't bother her. With mounting urgency, she begins to share his obsession with bugs, and together they hurtle headlong into a paranoid fantasy that ties together in one perfect conspiracy all of the suspicions they've ever had about anything. There is a scene we're not prepared for, in which they're peering into a cheap microscope and seeing whatever they think they see.\rMichael is mad, and Agnes' personality seems to need him to express its own madness. Ashley Judd's final monologue is a sustained cry of nonstop breathless panic, twisted logic and sudden frantic insight that is a kind of behavior very rarely risked in or out of the movies. It may not be Shakespeare, but it's not any easier.\rShannon, a member of A Red Orchid Theatre in Chicago, delivers his own nonstop rapid-fire monologue of madness; he has a frightening speech that scares the audience but makes perfect sense to Agnes. His focus and concentration compares in some ways to Peter Greene's work in Lodge Kerrigan's frightening \"Clean, Shaven.\"\rThe film is lean, direct, unrelenting. A lot of it takes place in the motel room, which by the end has been turned into an eerie cave lined with aluminum foil, a sort of psychic air raid shelter against government emissions or who knows what else? \"They're watching us,\" Peter says.\rThe thing about \"Bug\" is that we're not scared for ourselves so much as for the characters in the movie. Judd and Shannon bravely cast all restraint aside and allow themselves to be seen as raw, terrified and mad. The core of the film involves how quickly Judd's character falls into sympathy with Shannon's. She seems like a potential paranoid primed to be activated, and yet her transformation never seems hurried and is always convincing.\rFor Friedkin, the film is a return to form after some disappointments like \"Jade.\" it feels like a young man's picture, filled with edge and energy. Some reviews have criticized \"Bug\" for revealing its origins as a play, since most of it takes place on one set. But of course it does. There is nothing here to \"open up\" and every reason to create a claustrophobic feel. Paranoia shuts down into a desperate focus. It doesn't spread its wings and fly."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Being Flynn", "Review": "An early shot in \"Being Flynn\" shows Robert De Niro behind the wheel of a Yellow Cab, and the ground shifts beneath the movie. To summon up his most iconic role must represent De Niro's faith in this film. I can understand why he felt that much faith in the project, but I'm not sure the film deserves it. De Niro plays Jonathan Flynn, in his own estimation one of the three greatest American writers (the others: Mark Twain and J.D. Salinger). He claims publishers have been bidding fortunes on his work in progress, but we follow his decline: He loses his apartment, loses his cab and is reduced to hanging out in the well-heated lobbies of buildings.  Advertisement We learn about him from his son, Nick Flynn (Paul Dano), who also intends to be a great writer; there are two voiceovers in the film, one by Jonathan, one by Nick, although Nick may be writing his father's narration. There is a real Nick Flynn, who first told this story in a 2005 memoir, Another Bull**** Night in Suck City (asterisks mine). Whether his real-life father was a writer I've been unable to determine, but we know his parents were divorced when he was young, his mother killed herself when he was 22, and he actually did go to work in a homeless shelter, where he met his father for the first time when the old man turned up looking for a room for the night. If you want to be a writer and something like that happens to you, it's inevitable that it will turn up in a book. By all accounts, the memoir is a powerful piece of work. Throughout the film, Nick's subtext is: Am I doomed to be a failure like my dad? Nick tells us his father was mostly absent during his childhood \u2014 in prison for bad check writing. His mother (Julianne Moore) explains this to the boy as well as she can. Alcohol is the problem of the father, cocaine becomes the problem of the son. Assuming such a life doesn't kill you, it reads nicely in those little authors' biographies on the insides of dust jackets: The author overcame drug addiction and worked in a homeless shelter before winning a Guggenheim. What's admirable about \"Being Flynn\" is that it doesn't cave in to the standard Hollywood redemption formulas, with the father redeemed and the son inspired. It's more complicated than that. Jonathan Flynn perhaps has mental problems or simply likes to prevaricate; does he really believe in his greatness? As for the son, his childhood memories seem limited to repeated games of catch and rummaging through a box full of letters that Jonathan sent from prison. Julianne Moore plays a loving mother, but not much is done with the character. Advertisement Paul Dano is an actor who can be distant and mystifying. He makes it interesting. He sometimes approaches a scene with passive aggression. He understands the material, he understands the character, but he isn't going to do the heavy lifting for us. In films like \"There Will Be Blood,\" \"The Ballad of Jack and Rose\" and \"Meek's Cutoff,\" he plays the silent dissenter to the dominant characters. In \"Being Flynn,\" Nick uses his writing to express feelings he isn't forthright about in life. When Jonathan unexpectedly materializes, he's at a loss, and his feelings are the subject of the film. De Niro's father is a man who has run out of options. There is no longer anyone who much cares if he's telling the truth. Nick, however, has a girlfriend named Denise (Olivia Thirlby) who cares for him and sees that he needs to be doing something. She works at the homeless shelter and persuades him to give it a try. She perhaps instinctively spots Nick as one of those \"writers\" for whom it's hard work, not writing every day. I'm happy that the film didn't settle for the Hollywood redemption formula, but ambivalent that it leaves us in suspension. Neither character is ready to have his chance meeting result in anything definite. Jonathan seems doomed. That would be the film's easy way out, but it isn't sure which way it should take. In a sense, director Paul Weitz (\"About a Boy\") has the same kind of passivity that works for Dano: He'll take us so far and leave us. Robert De Niro has been through a bad patch lately. His contemporary Al Pacino has moved from one success to another by going out of his way to choose challenging projects (\"You Don't Know Jack,\" \"The Merchant of Venice\"). De Niro, perhaps absorbed in his Tribeca enterprises, has seemed to drift. He and Weitz worked together on \"Little Fockers,\" not a high point for either one. Now here is a much more ambitious film that almost but not quite justifies the hope inspired by that shot of a Yellow Cab. Note: The incomparable Lili Taylor, seen in the homeless shelter, is Nick Flynn's real-life companion."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Spiderwick Chronicles", "Review": "\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\" is a terrific entertainment for the whole family, except those below a certain age, who are likely to be scared out of their wits. What is that age? I dunno; they're your kids. But I do know the PG classification is insane, especially considering what happens right after a father says he loves his son. This is a PG-13 movie, for sure. But what will cause nightmares for younger kids will delight older ones, since \"The Spiderwick Chronicles\" is a well-crafted family thriller that is truly scary and doesn't wimp out. Advertisement Based on a well-known series of books, the movie involves a soon-to-be divorced mom and her three children who come to live in a creepy old mansion. This is Spiderwick, named after her grandfather Arthur Spiderwick, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The house itself is one of the stars of the movie, looking Victorian/Gothic with countless nooks and crannies and shadows and scary sounds. Is it haunted? Nothing that comforting. It's ... inhabited. The mother is Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker), who is battling with the rebellious Jared (Freddie Highmore), one of her twin sons. He doesn't like being away from his dad, is homesick, doesn't want anything to do with this dusty and spiderwebby old ruin that was left to his mom by her aunt. Jared's brainy twin Simon looks identical, no doubt because he is also played by Freddie Highmore, born in 1992, a gifted young actor best known for \"Finding Neverland,\" \"August Rush\" and \"The Golden Compass.\" The twins' sister is the plucky Mallory (Sarah Bolger), a fencer who seldom goes anywhere without her sword. Jared is the kind of kid who is always getting blamed for everything. When stuff starts disappearing, for example, he gets the rap. But he's brave, and when he finds a hidden dumbwaiter, he hauls himself up to a hidden room -- his grandfather's study, left undisturbed after all these years. This room fairly reeks of forbidden secrets. Don't read further unless you already know, as the film's Web site makes abundantly clear, that he finds a \"field guide\" to the unseen world, left by his grandfather (David Strathairn), and that with its help and a Seeing Stone, Jared can see goblins, spirits, hobgoblins, ogres, trolls and griffins, which themselves can take many shapes. Some of them are amusing, like Thimbletack (voice of Martin Short), some alarming like Boggart (Short again), some helpful like Hogsqueal (voice of Seth Rogen) but undependable. Anyway, Jared finally convinces his brother, and finally his sister and mother, that what he reports is real, but then the Graces are faced with dire threats. This is all done with a free mixture of lighthearted action, heavy action and some dramatic scenes that are pretty heavy going for younger imaginations. The movie is distinguished by its acting, not least by the great Joan Plowright as old Aunt Lucinda. Strathairn is completely credible as a spirit-world investigator, although exactly where the sparkling points of light take him, and what he does there, is a little murky. They say be careful what you ask for because you might get it. I've often hailed back to the really creepy moments in Disney classics, like what happens to \"Dumbo\" and \"Bambi,\" and I've complained that recent family movies are too sanitized. This one, directed by Mark Waters (\"Freaky Friday\"), doesn't skip a beat before its truly horrific moments, so if you're under 8 or 9 years old, don't say you weren't warned. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Bird People", "Review": "Pascale Ferran\u2019s \u201cBird People\u201d contains two complementary\r\ndramas within its unique structure; neither of them completely work. While\r\nthere are some phenomenal twists of the narrative knife in this unique story of\r\na flier who grounds himself and an earthbound woman who takes flight, \u201cBird\r\nPeople\u201d also includes wildly aggravating tonal and pacing issues. It\u2019s a film\r\nabout jumping into the void, taking that risk that we have all considered\r\ntaking at one point or another in our lives. We all reach moments in our\r\nexistence where we\u2019re tempted to just take flight, leave the world behind.\r\nFamily, friends and obligations usually keep us from doing so, but the urge to\r\nleave it all behind never fully disappears. Advertisement Gary (the always-good Josh Charles, who reportedly got this\r\npart through his fantastic work on \u201cIn Treatment\u201d) is the man who jumps into\r\nthat void when he decides, after a few dull business meetings, that he\u2019s not\r\nleaving Paris. He\u2019s not going on to his next meeting in Dubai. He\u2019s not\r\nreturning home to the States. He\u2019s quitting his job. He\u2019s leaving his wife and\r\nfamily. And he\u2019s not even sure what he\u2019s doing next or where he\u2019s going next. Gary\r\ncalls his co-workers and breaks the news. And he has an emotional, devastating\r\nconversation with his wife (Radha Mitchell) via Skype. In detailed, heartbreaking beats, we watch a man tell his partner that he won\u2019t be coming home. Sure, there\u2019s\r\nan implication of love lost between the two of them a long time ago, but it\u2019s\r\nstill hard to fathom a man leaving so much responsibility behind him like an\r\nunused plane ticket. After Gary\u2019s life has been disassembled to the point that he\u2019s\r\nfree from all tethers, a maid named Audrey (Ana\u00efs Demoustier) similarly throws\r\noff her traditional structure in a way that I won\u2019t spoil (but the title\r\ncertainly hints at it). The second half of \u201cBird People\u201d replaces the realism\r\nof the first half with fantasy elements that thematically complement the first.\r\nThis is a film about people breaking free, and when they realize that common\r\nsubtext to their lives at the end of the story, it has some undeniable thematic\r\nresonance. However, it takes WAY too long to get there. Ferran is prone\r\nto \u201cflights of fancy,\u201d pardon the pun, as some scenes in her film go on unchecked while others aren\u2019t allowed nearly the right amount of time to develop.\r\nThe scene in which Gary officially breaks his marriage is interminable, with\r\nlong silences and what sound like improvised emotional beats. I\u2019m sure one\r\ncould argue that this enhances the realism of the scene, but that doesn\u2019t make\r\nit entertaining. And the key fantasy sequence in the movie is one that I never\r\nthought would end. There\u2019s a much stronger, tighter, captivating version of \u201cBird\r\nPeople\u201d buried in this bloated take on a unique story. \u201cBird People\u201d is a movie for which it\u2019s tempting to make\r\nexcuses. I like Charles\u2019 work here. As he was on \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d he\u2019s so\r\ncompletely in the moment. He doesn\u2019t overplay beats, and I hope he soon gets a\r\npart that really takes him to the next level in terms of international\r\nattention. Demoustier is a charming young actress. And there are clearly\r\ninteresting ideas taking flight here. It\u2019s the execution of the flight plan\r\nthat keeps them from reaching their destination. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Hangman", "Review": "I understand that we\u2019re not owed anything specific by the late-career decisions of artists we once adored.

The great works still hold up, and he can do what he wants with his retirement years. He\u2019s earned it.

Advertisement This is a film that opens with Al Pacino\u2019s hang-dog cop getting sideswiped, going on a poorly-filmed high-speed chase, and then pulling a gun on the driver despite the urging of those around him to be careful because he may have a bomb. \u201cSunovabitch just ruined my car,\u201d he responds. It doesn't get smarter from there.\u00a0It\u2019s the kind of script that allows an Oscar winner to say \u201cSerious fuzzy feather sticking out of my ass.\u201d (Come to think of it, that may actually be in the Plus column.) Most of all, it\u2019s the kind of ridiculous serial killer movie that makes zero sense when one thinks about it for over a second. I don\u2019t mind the occasional\u00a0wild leap in logic, but this one requires too much jumping, and Pacino and I are just too tired.    The silliness starts when a New York Times reporter named Christi Davies (Brittany Snow), who mentions she was nominated for a Pulitzer lest you think this is a little silly, comes to do a story about the police because, ya know, things have been strained between officers and the public lately. OK. On orders of the captain (Sarah Shahi), she\u2019s given complete carte blanche ridealong status with a surly officer named Ruiney (Karl Urban). In a bad movie, the \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor is easily the best thing about \u201cHangman.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s got that square jaw plus bone-deep exasperation formula that works for the genre, and I wish he\u2019d do an actual noir sometime soon that took advantage of the fact that he looks like someone who would have been a star in the '40s.    Back to this nonsense. On the same night Christi gets to the station, she goes with Ruiney on a case straight out of a James Patterson novel. There\u2019s a body hanging outside an elementary school with a large \u2018O\u2019 carved in its chest, and two mannequins inside looking at a chalkboard, on which an incomplete game of hangman is scribbled. Carved into the desk is Detective Ruiney\u2019s badge number as well as, you guessed it, the badge number of Pacino\u2019s retired Detective Archer. Before you can say \u201chuh, that's weird\u201d the trio is off on a serial killer chase that would make John Doe say, \u201cthis seems a little like overkill.\u201d The most bizarre serial killer case in America in years is apparently being investigated by one cop, a reporter, and a retired detective. OK then. Speeding trains, pig heads, stolen blood\u2014the one that keeps \u201cHangman\u201d watchable is it\u2019s so ridiculous that you almost have to admire the insanity.    Advertisement Almost. By the final act\u2019s heated goofiness, I had long given up on seeing a glimpse of Pacino\u2019s true skill underneath the straight-to-DVD screenwriting quality. He simply doesn\u2019t care about anything that\u2019s happening here, as evidenced by his blank expressions and an inconsistently bizarre accent that sounds a little like he's from New Orleans at times and other times just like a riff on the mumbling later days of Marlon Brando. It\u2019s just one indication of how little the actor cares about what he's doing\u00a0here. And, if he doesn't, why should you?"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Towelhead", "Review": "\"Towelhead\" presents material that cries out to be handled with quiet empathy and hammers us with it. I understand what the film is trying to do, but not why it does it with such crude melodrama. The tone is all wrong for a story of child sexuality and had me cringing in my seat. It either has to be a tragedy or some kind of dark comedy like Kubrick's brilliant \"Lolita,\" but here it is simply awkward, embarrassing and painful. It tells the story of Jasira (Summer Bishil), a 13-year-old Lebanese-American girl with an obsession about her emerging sexuality. Well, all 13-year-olds feel such things. That's why so many of them stop talking to us. They don't know how to feel about themselves. Jasira thinks she does. She's turned on by taxi ads for showgirls, by sexy photos, by her own body. She discovers masturbating more or less by accident, likes it, precociously discusses orgasms. Advertisement Her American mother (Mario Bello) lives in Syracuse, N.Y. Her Lebanese father (Peter Macdissi, of \"Six Feet Under\") works for NASA in Houston. Neither is the parent of the year in any conceivable year. Her mother discovers her own boyfriend carefully shaving Jasira's pubic hair and is angry with the girl, not the boyfriend. She ships Jasira off to her father in Houston. He can seem cheerful and ingratiating, but slaps her for wearing a T-shirt to the table, forbids her to wear tampons (\"only whores and married ladies wear them\") and is boiling with rage -- partly because some of his neighbors think he is an Arab, but he is a Lebanese Christian who hates Saddam even more than they do. Jasira starts baby-sitting the younger kid next door, who turns her on to his dad's porno magazines. His dad, known only as Mr. Vuoso, is played by Aaron Eckhart, who was brave enough to take on this slimy role. He actually begins with a variation on the ancient theme of \"come sit over here on the bed next to me,\" which escalates to rape. That Jasira is fascinated and to some degree encourages him is meaningless; she knows little about what she is encouraging and apparently thinks of having sex with an adult as merely the sort of thing that her reactionary dad would slap her for. The progress of her journey involves bloody tampons and other details that could be relevant if handled with more sensitivity. She has sex with an African-American fellow student, who seems polite and nice but is experienced enough to know he is doing wrong. Her dad forbids her to see him because he is black. Meanwhile, Mr. Vuoso's son calls her a towelhead, a camel jockey and worse. Racism is everywhere here. The movie was written and directed by Alan Ball, who also wrote \"American Beauty.\" Two movies, two suburban men obsessed with underage beauties. Is there a pattern here? Ball also created and has directed \"Six Feet Under,\" which specializes in acute embarrassment and spectacular misbehavior. So does the director Todd Solondz, whose \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" (1995) also dealt with a troubled adolescent girl. But Solondz knew how to do it, what his intentions were, how to challenge us and yet involve our sympathy. Ball seems merely thrashing about in a plot too transgressive for his skills. Advertisement The actors are courageous. Another key role is played by Toni Collette, as a pregnant neighbor who suspects what's going on and tries to help Jasira and offer her refuge from both her father and Mr. Vuoso. Trouble is, Jasira thinks she doesn't want to be rescued and has come to love orgasms, as is not uncommon. She's played by an appealing young actress named Summer Bishil, who certainly looks as if she is 13, but was 18 when the film was made. Without showing nudity, Ball plays tricks with lighting and camera angles that sometimes regard her like a cheesecake model. I didn't enjoy that feeling. When Billy Wilder's lighting gives Marilyn Monroe a teasingly low neckline in \"Some Like It Hot,\" that's one thing. When Ball's framing provides one for a child, that's another. Yes, the sexual abuse of children is a tragedy. Yes, there are adults who need to be educated, enlightened, warned, or thrashed and locked up. This is not the film to assist that process. The actors labor to be true to their characters and sincere in their work, and they succeed. The movie lets them down. It is more clueless than its heroine."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Don't Think Twice", "Review": "When I lived in Chicago, every weekend my friends and I made our way to ImprovOlympic, on the corner of Clark and Addison, to watch teams perform long-form improv (known as \"The Harold\"). The house team was called \"The Family\": six insanely talented men, all of whom studied with guru Del Close, and all of whom who have gone on to huge success: Adam McKay, Neil Flynn, Matt Besser, Ali Farahnakian, Ian Roberts and Miles Stroth. People like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler often \"sat in,\" performing with the group. Those shows are still legendary to anyone lucky enough to have been there. In good improv like that, people communicate with lightning-speed via ESP and sixth-sense.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Don't Think Twice,\" Mike Birbiglia's wonderful new film, is so spot-on in its evocation of that whole \"scene,\" onstage and off\u2014its intimacy, competition, struggles and rhythms\u2014that at times it feels like a documentary. The movie has the patience and intelligence to approach extremely esoteric concepts: improv's \"group mind,\" the generosity of good performers, the specific rules of improv and how they impact the group outside the theatre. Birbiglia is a stand-up comedian and director (\"Sleepwalk With Me,\" his first film), with a background in improv. Not only does he know that world so well, he also knows how to communicate\u00a0it to an audience. \"Don't Think Twice\" is hilarious, yes, but it's also thoughtful and sad and sweet. Birbiglia knows how to communicate those things, too. \"Don't Think Twice\" follows a New York-based improv group called, appropriately, \"The Commune\" through a year in their lives. The Brooklyn theatre where they've been doing improv has been sold, and homelessness approaches. It's a very New York problem, as small black-box theaters disappear one by one, gleaming condos and Starbucks rising in their place, a situation that strands the non-Union theatre scene in a desert. The Commune casts around desperately for an affordable space, and along with that are the trials and tribulations of each group member. It sounds like \"Don't Think Twice\" is your run-of-the-mill, 20-something ensemble comedy, but it's not. Grounded in a very specific scene, it understands the world in which these characters operate, and what happens when a close group like that faces fracturing change. Before the story gets going, there is a brief introduction to the history of improv, as well as an explanation of improv's three rules (the most important being saying yes). More commonly known as \"Yes, and ... ,\" this means that a performer says \"yes\" to everything that happens on-stage. One of the cardinal sins of improv is saying \"No.\" Example: One person points a finger at another person and shouts \"Bang bang!\" The person who was clearly just shot at says, \"That's not a gun, that's your finger.\" The line might get a laugh but it ends the scene. \"Yes, and ... \" makes sure that a scene continues, creating the environment of acceptance that makes all good improv possible. \"Yes, and ... \" is how Birbiglia and his ensemble approach every scene in the film. Advertisement Birbiglia plays Miles, a little bit older than everyone else in the group. He taught most of them in improv classes and struggles with bitterness and hurt because, one by one, his students have surpassed him professionally. Jack (Keegan-Michael Key, from \"Key & Peele,\" beautiful here in a complex performance) and Samantha (the superb Gillian Jacobs) are in a comfortable relationship that is then challenged when Jack seems like he's advancing.\u00a0Lindsay (Tami Sagher) is a trust-fund baby who lives at home and doesn't have to shlep around in a day job. She feels guilty about her privilege. (This is another extremely accurate observation about any theatre scene: the unfair envy towards those whose family has money.) Bill (Chris Gethard) slaves over his writing submissions to \"Weekend Live\"\u2014a clear replica of \"Saturday\u00a0Night Live,\" one\u00a0that\u00a0the group watches religiously, poker-faced and jealous\u2014until he is distracted by his father falling ill. And finally, there's Allison (Kate Micucci), who is excellent at improv but has a secret wish to complete her graphic novel. Some stories get more attention than others, although there is a clear through-line for each character. The major catalyst for change in the group is when one member auditions for \"Weekend Live\"\u00a0and actually gets cast. They're elated, and the group is too: one of their own has made it! Nobody wants to ruin the winner's moment, but the mixed feelings are palpable. It's reminiscent of Oscar Wilde's great thought: \"Anyone can sympathize with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature\u2014it requires, in fact, the nature of a true Individualist to sympathize with a friend\u2019s success.\" The selected one has mixed feelings about leaving their friends behind, and is not presented as soulless and evil for abandoning the group and going after the brass ring. \"Don't Think Twice\" is insightful on how success changes relationships. One of the most accurate things about Birbiglia's\u00a0film\u00a0is about how it also later admits that success doesn't look just one way. Outward success (fame, fortune) has value to some, but not all. \"Don't Think Twice\" is meticulous in its progression but also free-form in style. Parties and hanging out at the bar are punctuated by group \"bits,\" each person riffing on whatever happens in the moment. Jack and Samantha's relationship is a case in point. Movies don't often show couples who place such a high premium on being funny for one another. Couples like that exist. When do we ever get to see them? There's a lot of improv in the film, and those scenes could have been awful if it felt like these were rehearsed \"bits\" as opposed to spontaneous events. Whatever was planned and whatever was unplanned is not at all evident, and Joe Anderson's intuitive, flowing\u00a0camera moves around on the stage, in the thick of the action. You can see why people flock to The Commune's shows week after week, in the same way Chicago audiences still flock to Second City and ImprovOlympic (now known as The iO). Improv is a great model for society, which explains why people devoted to improv talk about it with an evangelical gleam in their eyes. What would it be like if we all listened to one another like that? What would it be like if we accepted one another's contributions with generosity and openness? What if we approached every interaction not with \"No, but ... \" but with \"Yes, and ... \". Birbiglia's beautiful, sneakily profound film shows a world where \"Yes, and ... \" is the default.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Special ID", "Review": "Donnie Yen (\"Ip Man\", \"Dragon\") returns to contemporary action with \"Special ID,\" an action film that will test the critical sensibilities of those most loyal to the martial arts genre. There are three remarkable fight scenes in Clarence Fok Yiu-leung's film; the kind of sequences that will demand inclusion in any clip reel of Yen's career. There's also a fight in and out of a moving car that dazzles with its clear lack of VFX. You can feel the pavement whizzing by and the danger feels real. Four scenes (although the car chase really leads into the final fight so it's more like three); you can get popcorn or read a book during the rest of the movie. The narrative tissue that connects these scenes is so inconsistent, clich\u00e9d, and unengaging that even Yen's loyal fans will have to issue caveats with their recommendations. \"Oh, the movie's no good, but did you see that scene on the overpass?!?!\"  Advertisement Detective Chen Zilong (Yen) is so deep undercover in the criminal underworld in Hong Kong that he fears he will never come back. He's known as Dragon to his fellow criminals; few know of his true identity as a man of the law who dotes on his philosophical mother (Paw Hee-ching). When an old adversary to the Triads named Sunny (Andy On) starts making waves, Chen has to stop him before his cover is blown and all-out Triad warfare ensues. Naturally, there's a gorgeous young cop named Fang (Jing Tian) to help out.  An undercover cop, a potential love story, Triads\u2013what could go wrong here? It's a lack of depth and consistency. The film has all the right beats for a dark martial arts thriller but can't find the rhythm. Writer Szeto Kam-Yuen dutifully checks off the clich\u00e9s but there's no passion in it; nothing is given any time to develop, possibly due to reported problems during production that led to a number of project revisions. Yen often looks lost in terms of character as the film's tone bounces around from \"Infernal Affairs\" thriller to buddy comedy to something else entirely. Tian makes the most memorable impact, bringing the piece a much-needed energy whenever she's on-screen. On is typically physical but poorly developed as a villain. And so we have a potential love story that never goes anywhere, a rivalry with his returned nemesis that's undercooked, and bizarrely long scenes with mom that feel pulled from another film. The movie opens with a bang, starting with a fantastic fight sequence after a game of Mahjong that hints at a gritty, intense action flick to come, and then there's not another moment of \"fist meet face\" for over 20 minutes. And you won't care about what happens in those 20 minutes. And yet it's impossible to deny that what \"Special ID\" does well it does extremely well. The great cinematographer Peter Pau (\"The Killer\", \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\") can shoot a fight scene at night in the rain as expertly as anyone in this business and the stunt direction by Bruce Law (\"Man of Tai Chi\", \"The Raid 2: Berandal\") is remarkable. When the fight scenes really get going\u2014as in the first scene, a Yen-versus-dozens centerpiece that starts in a restaurant and spills out into the street, and the amazing final sequences on the overpass\u2014\"Special ID\" is something to behold. It's just a shame that those peaks are so drastically offset against the film's many narrative valleys. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Awake", "Review": "Do not believe anything you hear about \u201cAwake,\u201d do not talk to anyone about it, and above all do not even glance at the poster or ads, which criminally reveal a crucial plot twist. This movie, which was withheld from critics, and has scored a pitiful 13 percent on the Tomatometer from those few who were able to see it, is a surprisingly effective thriller. I went to a regular theater to see it Friday afternoon, knowing nothing about it except that the buzz was lethal, and sat there completely absorbed. Advertisement  The movie involves a very, very rich young man named Clay Beresford (Hayden Christensen), who lives with his loving but dominating mother (Lena Olin), and fears to tell her about his engagement to the beautiful Samantha (Jessica Alba). But \u201cthe clock is ticking,\u201d he is warned by his friend and surgeon Jack Howard (Terrence Howard). Jack saved Clay in the E.R. after he had a massive heart attack, and now Jack\u2019s on the waiting list for a transplant. \u201cMarry that girl,\u201d Jack advises him, and even invites him into the operating room for a trial run to explain how dangerous the surgery is.  This and other medical procedures are highly unlikely, and the heart transplant itself involves an improbably small team, a last-minute replacement as the anesthesiologist, and an uninvited visitor allowed to put on a surgical gown and observe. But accuracy is not the point. Suspense is. And from the moment Clay realizes he is not fully under anesthesia and can hear and feel everything that is happening, the movie had me. The character does a voice-over in which he tries to force his eyes open and signal that he\u2019s conscious, and then a series of unexpected developments take place which I will not even begin to reveal.  Since the movie involves a plot which cannot be discussed, let me just say that I may be the slowest tomato on the meter, but I did not anticipate the surprises, did not anticipate them piling on after one another, got very involved in the gory surgical details, and found the supporting soap opera good as such things go.  It involves a rich kid who believes he can never live up to his father, a mother who believes she cannot surrender her son, and the beautiful Jessica Alba coming between them. It also involves Clay\u2019s determination to have the transplant performed by Dr. Jack, his trusted friend, instead of his mother\u2019s candidate (Arliss Howard), who boasts \u201cI have had my hands inside presidents.\u201d He wrote the book on transplants, and will be the next surgeon general. \u201cWell, I hope Jack has read your book,\u201d Clay replies. Advertisement  All preposterous, I know, but this edges us into a consideration of why we are at the movies in the first place, and what works, and what does not work. I got involved. I felt real suspense. I thought Lena Olin gave a nuanced performance as the mother, who is deeper than we first think, and that the tension between her and Alba was plausible. And I thought the scenes where Clay imagines leaving his body, roaming the hospital, and having psychic conversations were well-handled.  So maybe I\u2019m wrong. It has happened before. \u201cAwake,\u201d written and directed by first-timer Joby Harold, clocks at only 78 minutes, but that\u2019s the right length for what happens. The movie opens under a cloud on a weekend all other mainstream movies have sidestepped, apparently because it\u2019s our duty to commence Christmas shopping. But I felt what I felt, and there you have it."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "World War Z", "Review": "\"World War Z\" plays as if someone watched the similar \"28 Days Later\" and thought, \"That was a good movie, but it would be better if it cost $200 million, there were armies of zombies, and the hero were perfect and played by Brad Pitt.\" Which is another way of saying that if you need proof that sometimes more can be less, here you go. Directed by Marc Forster and written by everyone in Hollywood, if rumors are to be believed (though three got credit), this adaptation of Max Brooks' oral history of a zombie apocalypse... Advertisement Hold on. I'm sorry, but before we take this movie apart, let's take a closer look at that last phrase: \"oral history of a zombie apocalypse.\" Those six words tell you everything this film gave up by going in a conventional direction. I've never read Brooks' book and don't have any immediate plans to, but the notion of telling this tale in a roundabout way, by having survivors of the conflagration sit there and talk to an unseen cameraperson\u2014perhaps against a plain black background, with or without cutaways to still photographs or \"news video\"\u2014is electrifying to consider. Such an approach might have yielded the first fresh contribution to the zombie picture\u00a0since \"Rec\". The latter viewed an undead attack through the eye of a home video camera and treated the result as \"found footage\" -- a great post-\"Blair Witch\" embellishment, considering how much of horror's effectiveness lies in what you\u00a0don't see. A faithful transcription of Brooks' source might have taken fright-film minimalism even further. What\u00a0better way to amplify the hideousness of the dead attacking the living than by fixing a camera's unblinking eye on the survivors as they talked about the homes and people and limbs they lost in the struggle? A friend who's heard the audiobook version of \"World War Z\" said it reminded her of old time radio drama: \"Theater of the mind,\" she said. \"World War Z,\" in contrast, is just bloody eye and ear candy.\u00a0I realize it's problematic to review a film on the basis of what it might have been, but when that same film substitutes a vision that's vastly less intriguing and original than the one offered by its source, it's a fair tactic, and what's onscreen here is just another zombie picture, gigantic but otherwise unremarkable. It's not that scary until you get to the end. Ironically, what makes the end work is its embrace of old fashioned zombie film values: intimacy, silence, suggestion, and the strategic deployment of boredom to lull viewers into complacency and set them up for the next big scare. \"World War Z\" is mostly David Lean-on-caffeine panoramas of computer-generated zombies swarming ant-like up walls and over barricades and taking down computer-generated choppers while Forster's close-up camera swings all over the place to generate unearned \"excitement.\" The final setpiece watches three people sneak into a lab that's overrun by a few dozen sleepy and distracted flesh-snackers. It's slow.\u00a0It's quiet. It's scary. It works. Sometimes when you re-invent the wheel, the result doesn't get you very far.\u00a0 Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former United Nations field agent who retired to spend time with his wife Karin (Mirelle Enos) and their charming daughters. He's every other character played by Robert Redford in the 1970s and '80s: noble, brave, calm in a crisis, endlessly resourceful, kind to his spouse and children, respectful of authority but not slavishly so, independent-minded by not arrogant; a snooze. \u00a0Forster and his collaborators deserve credit for plunging us into the thick of things: the Lanes learn that society is collapsing when a seemingly ordinary urban traffic jam is jolted into surreality by an explosion, a stampede of terrified civilians and their vehicles, and a furious attack by people who've been infected by a virus that turns them into ravenous ghouls. (The film's details are fuzzy, but I think they actually are ghouls here, not just rabid and homicidal mortals, as in the \"Days\" pictures.) \u00a0The rest of the picture is a globetrotting medical mystery that just happens to feature zombies, with Lane and various helpers, some military and others scientific, trying to figure out what sparked the disease and counter it before the undead overrun everything. It's \"Contagion\" or \"The Andromeda Strain,\" but with zombies, and without much panache.\u00a0 Advertisement Although Mirielle Enos' talents are wasted -- she anchors a police procedural on television, but this Hollywood movie is content to cast her as a standard-issue Dutiful Wife -- there are some dandy cameos and supporting turns. I like David Morse's one scene as a twitchy, traumatized CIA agent who knows something about the origin of the disease, and James Badge Dale as a U.S. Special Forces captain whose gung-ho competence is no match for the zombie hordes, and\u00a0Daniella Kertesz as Segan, an Israeli soldier whose indefatigable spirit helps the hero save the day even after she's suffered unimaginable trauma.\u00a0 But aside from Segan, none of the characters rise above the level of purely functional placeholder-types, and there are too many scenes that replicate zombie film tropes, minus the passionate invention that other films have brought to the task. When a supporting character is infected and instantly \"turns,\" I was reminded of that masterful sequence in \"28 Days Later\" in which Brendan Gleeson's jovial dad catches a drop of contaminated blood in his eye and battles the virus while his daughter looks on. The poor bastard goes through a whole existential crisis in less than a minute. The sheer terror of losing one's soul has rarely been communicated so economically. Nothing in \"World War Z\" comes anywhere near that scene's power.\u00a0 Forster deserves credit, I guess, for finding a way to make a \u00a0PG-13 zombie movie\u00a0without totally softening it. Horrendous violence occurs off-camera or below the frame line but doesn't lack for impact. There are some shiveringly good moments near the end, particularly when Gerry gets too close to a walker with snicker-snack rat-teeth. But elsewhere, you may feel as though a genre's essence has been betrayed. Forster has made a zombie movie for people who don't like zombie movies. That's not the sort of accomplishment one should brag about. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "A Most Wanted Man", "Review": "Anton Corbijn\u2019s \u201cA Most Wanted Man\u201d has an added and perhaps\r\nunwanted gravity by virtue of forever bearing the title of \u201cThe Last Leading\r\nRole of Philip Seymour Hoffman.\u201d Watching one of the great American actors embody his final leading man gives the entire piece the air of a haunting, particularly\r\nbecause PSH\u2019s character is such a world-weary, melancholic guy, someone who\r\nseems to be out of time and patience. It has been difficult to sever the truth\r\nof cinema\u2019s loss from his characters when watching Hoffman\u2019s work since his\r\npassing but this is the only time in which it feels like his tragic death has\r\nactually changed the final product (it was somehow easier to get past in \"God\u2019s\r\nPocket,\" the \"Capote\" screening at Ebertfest and I imagine it will be in \"Mockingjay\"\r\nlater this year). Corbijn keeps the action of \"A Most Wanted Man\" at arms length or greater, never finding the heart of the piece despite mostly solid performances and strong production values. He allows us to stay disengaged from the narrative itself and to be\r\ndistracted by how much the movie world has lost. Advertisement Hoffman plays Gunther Bachmann, a man trapped in bureaucracy and shackled by a government that doesn\u2019t give him the trust or\r\ntools he needs to do his job. Bachmann is an intelligence expert in Hamburg,\r\nGermany, a place that will never be the same in terms of espionage because it\r\nserved as the home base for the 9/11 hijackers. How did the entire intelligence\r\ncommunity there not see that coming? Since that fateful day, Bachmann and his\r\nteam (which includes Daniel Bruhl and Nina Hoss) have been forced to work on an\r\never-shifting landscape. The government wants to hammer down on any nail that\r\nlooks out of place but Bachmann knows that it\u2019s the long, patient game that\r\nreaps the biggest rewards in the world of espionage. Bachmann stumbles upon one of the biggest cases of his\r\ncareer when a Russian man named Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin) arrives in\r\nHamburg, seeking asylum and his notoriously evil father\u2019s massive fortune. Issa\r\nis a half-Chechen, half-Russian Muslim, a title that raises every possible red\r\nflag in the eyes of Bachmann\u2019s team and those above him. Bachmann\u2019s superiors\r\nwant to grab Issa immediately. Bachmann knows that finding out\u00a0why Issa arrived in Hamburg is more important than just capturing him. So\r\nthe follow game begins.  Issa tracks down a banker (the always-effective Willem Dafoe), seeking his father\u2019s\r\ndirty money. He also forms a friendship with a human rights activist named\r\nAnnabel Richter played hollowly by Rachel McAdams, who ends up an important cog\r\nin Le Carre\u2019s machine, as do a CIA operative played by Robin Wright and a\r\nsuspicious Muslim leader played by Homayoun Ershadi. As in \"Tinker Tailor\r\nSoldier Spy\" and \"The Constant Gardener,\" everyone has a role to play in the\r\nspy game. And it\u2019s remarkable how much tension Le Carre can draw without\r\nmuch violence or traditional action at all. In \"A Most Wanted Man,\" every\r\ndecision, every admittance, every secret revealed or held can collapse the\r\nhouse of cards that Bachmann needs to stay upright to stop another 9/11. It is\r\na vision of the spy game as one of neverending frustrations and roadblocks. Advertisement It is also a cold, distant film; more than it needed to be. \u201cConstant\r\nGardner\u201d and \u201cTinker Tailor\u201d drew audiences into their complex world through\r\ntheir relatable characters, mostly the pair played so expertly by Rachel Weisz\r\nand Gary Oldman, respectively, but Corbijn offers no such channel into \u201cA Most Wanted Man.\u201d\r\nThere are glimpses of humanity in Hoffman\u2019s staccato German-accented delivery\r\nbut the problem comes in the dynamic between Annabel and Issa. This should be\r\nthe heat and emotion of the film, balanced against the cold visual palette that\r\nCorbijn and his team have chosen for the rest of it. Amidst the metal of\r\nsurveillance fans and glass windows of conference rooms in which life and death\r\ndecisions are being made, there is a tortured, broken soul of a Muslim/Chechen\r\nyoung man looking for anything human to latch on to.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Maya Angelou and Still I Rise", "Review": "A museum dedicated to the life of multi-hyphenate Maya Angelou would easily take up a city block, stand over ten stories tall and still feature rotating exhibits. But only in the lobby could one find a presentation of \"Maya Angelou and Still I Rise,\" a new documentary about her creative genius. It's more of a fleeting introduction to her work. It's not a display that could stand on its own.\u00a0 \n The film from co-directors Bob Hercules and Rita Coburn Whack does have the credit of being the first documentary made about Angelou's life. That sounds hard to believe at first, given Angelou's popularity and importance to American art, but also makes more sense when one considers that she also wrote seven autobiographies, along with numerous amounts of personal pieces. \"Maya Angelou and Still I Rise\" seeks to become the ultimate biography, while offering Angelou on camera, sharing her side of life stories that have become American lore in books like I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Told in mostly chronological order, the documentary touches upon many chapters of Angelou\u2019s life, starting with her upbringing in Stamps, Arkansas. While painting a picture of her upbringing in a poor, racist part of the country, it focuses on the growth of her voice, particularly when she was mute for a long time after a traumatic event. As a clue to her later brilliance without intense schooling, Angelou shares how she memorized full Shakespeare plays and read everything she could get her hands on during her formative years of silence. But as she says herself, \u201cWhen I decided to speak, I had a lot to say.\u201d\u00a0 \n As the documentary charts the course of how her creative voice blossomed across mediums, Angelou is a fascinating open book, with her perspective coming in between smiles during a talking head interview. In an incredible journey, she started as a dancer then singer (known as Miss Calypso), and then went onto write songs and short stories, before getting to personally know the like of Langston Hughes or James Baldwin. She established an importance that spread to other areas, like political activism, which led her to friendships with Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King, among many others. \u201cMaya Angelou and Still I Rise\u201d provides an in-depth picture of how prolific she was, the connections that led from one artistic opportunity to the next, and strong examples of how those she interacted with influenced her work. Hercules & Coburn\u2019s film celebrates the importance of others on our creativity, and with a brilliant example; a woman who gave back a voice to numerous communities, while helping the life of a black woman become more visible on a cultural scale.\u00a0 \n What the documentary adds to the Maya Angelou legacy can be found in various little gems, as it covers nearly every major form of artistry that she tackled, including songwriting (with Quincy Jones) and directing (the 1998 film \u201cDown in the Delta\u201d). Its talking head interviews are in particular a great find, including some beautiful words by Alfre Woodard and Cicely Tyson, or figures like President Bill Clinton, who speaks about why he chose her to write a poem (On the Pulse of Morning) for his presidential inauguration, which hadn\u2019t happened since Robert Frost: \u201cI knew she would make an impression. She was big and had the voice of God.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement \n In its management of footage featuring Angelou, from past and present, it does have some great moments. I loved seeing a clip of Angelou perform her poem \u201cThe Mask,\u201d her reactions fluctuating between big laughs and vivid tears, the best way that piece could be presented. And there\u2019s an unforgettable story from director John Singleton about the time Angelou was on set the set of 1993\u2019s \u201cPoetic Justice,\u201d and had an emotional breakthrough with a wound-up young man on set, revealed to be Tupac.\u00a0 \n As the story of Angelou exemplifies the power of expression, it only becomes increasingly apparent that this documentary has little artistry of its own. More in-depth history report than a piece of art, \u201cMaya Angelou and Still I Rise\u201d is a collection of fascinating information without style. It has serviceable standards, alternating between talking head interviews and stock footage, but the prowess of Angelou begs for some attitude itself, even if it requires a narrower or different focus. At least with its wide scope, \u201cMaya Angelou and Still I Rise\u201d shows that her time on Earth was about more than being an author, poet, civil rights activist, a mother, a dancer, a singer, a film director, producer, journalist and much more. Her life was poetry itself."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Standard Operating Procedure", "Review": "Errol Morris' \"Standard Operating Procedure,\" based on the infamous prison torture photographs from Abu Ghraib, is completely unlike anything I was expecting from such a film -- more disturbing, analytical and morose. This is not a \"political\" film nor yet another screed about the Bush administration or the war in Iraq. It is driven simply, powerfully, by the desire to understand those photographs. There are thousands of them, mostly taken not from the point of view of photojournalism, but in the spirit of home snapshots. They show young Americans, notably Lynndie England, posing with prisoners of war who are handcuffed in grotesque positions, usually naked, heads often covered with their underpants, sometimes in sexual positions. Miss England, who was about 20 at the time and weighed scarcely 100 pounds, often has a cigarette hanging from her mouth in a show of tough-guy bravado. But the effect is not to draw attention to her as the person who ordered these tableaux, but as a part of them. Some other force, not seen, is sensed as shaping them. Advertisement This invisible presence, we discover, is named Charles Graner, a staff sergeant Lynndie was in love with, who is more than 15 years her senior. She does what he suggests. She doesn't question. But then few questions are asked by most of the Americans in the photographs, who are not so much performing the acts as being photographed performing them. \"Pictures only show you a fraction of a second,\" says a Marine named Javel Davis, who was a prison guard but is not seen in any of them. \"You don't see forward and you don't see backward. You don't see outside the frame.\" He is expressing the central questions of the film: Why do these photos exist, why were they taken and what reality do they reflect? What do we think about these people? Those are the questions at the heart of many of Morris' films, all the way back to his first, \"Gates of Heaven\" (1978), in which to this day I am unable to say what he feels about his subjects or what they think of themselves. The answers would be less interesting anyway than the eternally enigmatic questions. Morris' favorite point of view is the stare. He chooses his subjects, regards them almost impassively, allows their usually strange stories to tell themselves. There is not a voice raised in \"S.O.P.\" The tone is set by a sad, elegiac, sometimes relentless score by Danny Elfman. The subject, in addition to the photographs, is Morris' interview subjects, seen in a mosaic of closeups as they speak about what it was like to be at Abu Ghraib. Most of them speak either in sorrow or resentment, muted, incredulous. How had they found themselves in that situation?  Yes, unspeakable acts of cruelty were committed in the prison. But not personally, if we can believe them, by the interviewees. The torturers seem to have been military intelligence specialists in interrogation. They, too, are following orders, and choose to disregard the theory that the information is useless since if you torture a man enough he will tell you anything. I cannot imagine what it would be like to be suspended by having my hands shackled behind my back so tightly I might lose them. Or feeling I am being drowned. And so on -- this need not be a litany of horrors. Advertisement More to the point of this film is that the prison wardens received their prisoners after the tortures were mostly committed, and then posed with them in ghastly \"human pyramids,\" \"dog piles\" or in scenes with sexual innuendo. Again, why? \"For the picture.\" The taking of the photos seems to have been the motivation for the instants they reveal. And, as a speaker observes in the film, if there had been no photos, the moments they depict would not have existed, and the scandal of Abu Ghraib would not have taken place. Yes, some of those we see in \"Standard Operating Procedure\" were paid for their testimony. Morris acknowledges that. He did not tell them what to say. I personally believed what they were telling me. What it came down to was, they found themselves under orders that they did not understand, involved in situations to provide a lifetime of nightmares. They were following orders, yes. But whose? Any orders to torture would have had to come from those with a rank of staff sergeant or above. But all of those who were tried, found guilty and convicted after Abu Ghraib were below that rank. At the highest level, results were demanded -- find information on the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein (whose eventual capture did not result from any information pried loose by torture). At lower levels, the orders were translated into using torture. But there was a deliberate cutoff between the high level demanding the results and the intermediate level authorizing the violation of U.S. and international law by the use of torture. At the opening of the film, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is seen, his blue blazer hooked over one shoulder, his white dress shirt immaculate, \"touring\" Abu Ghraib. He is shown one cell, then cancels his tour. He doesn't want to see any more. And so little Lynndie England is left with her fellow soldiers as the face of the scandal. And behind the photos of her and others lurk the enigmatic figure of Sgt. Charles Graner, who was not allowed by the military to be interviewed for this film. I imagine him as the kind of guy we all knew in high school, snickering in the corner, sharing thoughts we did not want to know with friends we did not want to make. If he posed many of the photos (and gave away countless copies of them), was it because he enjoyed being at one remove from their subjects? The captors were seen dominating their captives, and he was in the role, with his camera, of dominating both. Remember the photo of Lynndie posing with the prisoner on a leash? His name, we learn, was Gus. Lynndie says she wasn't dragging him: \"You can see the leash was slack.\" She adds: \"He would never had me standing next to Gus if the camera wasn't there.\" Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Itzhak", "Review": "\"Itzhak\" is a joyous film about a joyous man. Directed\u00a0 by Alison Chernick, it's a compact and immensely likable look at virtuoso violinist Itzhak Perlman. It's less concerned with covering the totality of his life than evoking his life force, which is good-humored, earthy and inspiring.  Because of its brevity, as well as its decision to show the subject existing in the moment rather than convene a bunch of talking heads or a narrator to discuss what his life and work have meant, \"Itzhak\" is best appreciated by people who know a little bit about Perlman already\u2014or who are OK with a film that's more of a pencil sketch on a cocktail napkin than a oil painting with an ornate frame that's intended to hang in a portrait gallery. This is a work in the tradition of fly-on-the-wall\u00a0celebrity portraits from the 1960s and '70s, like the classic Bob Dylan documentary \"Don't Look Back.\" It hangs out with Perlman, his wife Toby, his extended family and some of his colleagues, and watches them interact.\u00a0 Advertisement As accomplished as the film is at a craft level, there's no denying that much of its impact comes from having chosen Perlman as its subject. He's a fascinating man who's lived a dramatic life, starting at age four, when he contracted polio that impaired his mobility but did not stop him from becoming one of the world's most-honored instrumentalists.\u00a0 Some archival footage is deftly woven into the present-day material. This includes snippets of Perlman performing in different decades, pieces of a 1993 interview with his beloved mentor Dorothy Delay (who called him \"Sugarplum\" and asked him brain-teasing questions like, \"What's your concept of G-sharp?\"), and a clip of a 13-year old Perlman performing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\" Of the latter, Perlman acknowledges that, as talented as he clearly was, even at that tender age, he was booked because of his heroic handicapped-kid-overcomes-adversity story\u2014and that this particular aspect of his narrative has guided many of his choices as a public figure and philanthropist. The Perlmans' marriage is the foundation of the movie. Their interaction is a model of a fully functioning, long-lasting union based on mutual intellectual respect as well as affection. They've been together over 50 years and still enjoy each other's company. Toby is his biggest fan as well as advocate. \"When I hear that sound, when I hear that playing,\" Toby says of Itzhak's musicianship, \"It's like breathing. It's like being alive.\" But she's also his toughest critic, and has no compunction about telling him that a performance that dazzled thousands wasn't up to his highest standards.  From the opening scene of Perlman riding an Amigo scooter through the passageways of Citi Field en route to play \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before a New York Mets game, through late sections capturing his performance of John Williams's score for \"Schindler's List\" (for which he served as lead violinist), the film confirms Perlman's popular touch. He's a great raconteur and listener, so charismatic that he naturally claims the spotlight wherever he is, yet one can't help being struck by his approachable demeanor. Whether conducting an orchestra, sitting in with Billy Joel, dining with friends and family around a large table, or accepting an award, his accomplishments and aura never precede him, nor do they defensively cloak him in \"greatness\" or separate him from the supposed rabble. He seems delighted to be a part of the world he moves through, and that his art has made more bearable. He seems particularly amused by small children and pets.  Advertisement The filmmaking itself displays mastery in the spirit of its subject. There's never a doubt that you're in the hands of craftspeople operating at the peak of their powers, even as each choice serves the work.  Helen Yum's editing is superb. It displays a rare sense of how to cut musical performances and dialogue together in a way that preserves the continuity of the music while favoring the forward motion of the story. The editing of the non-musical scenes is equally impressive. There are a number of moments where the cutting of conversations attains a musicality of its own, evoking instruments in an orchestra taking cues from one another as well as the conductor.  A student in a class being guest-taught by Perlman astutely observes that, in musical performance, it's not enough just to hit the right note at the right moment: one must devote equal thought and care to entering and exiting the note, because it's the decision of when to get in and out, and how, that shapes emotion. She could be describing this documentary, a musical film about music and life."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Live Cargo", "Review": "The sky is often caught in the midst of a turbulent storm. Lightning cuts through the darkness. Waves crash violently on the rocky shore. Characters turn their eyes to the gray clouds above as if searching for answers to solve the problems in which they\u2019re mired. In \"Live Cargo,\" director/co-writer Logan Sandler strives to tell a story that finds poetry in the commonplace by shirking narrative conventions. The emotional turmoil these people struggle to navigate is clear because they seem incapable of cracking a smile and are often on the verge of tears. But despite the care put into the story and its heavy themes, \u201cLive Cargo\u201d has no emotional impact. Advertisement The film opens on a tragic day in the lives of a young couple, Nadine (Dree Hemingway) and Lewis (Lakeith Stanfield), as their first child is stillborn. Sandler and co-writer Thymaya Payne choose not to explain the particulars of this calamity. Instead the tense gazes of the actors, flickering fluorescent lights of the hospital, and unmoving child in Nadine\u2019s arms work to create a depressive mood that comes to define the entire film. Nadine and Lewis try to heal by going to a small Bahamian island on which Nadine\u2019s family has property. She obviously has deep history here, finding occasional comfort in father-like figure Roy (Robert Wisdom) and swimming in the ocean with impressive skill. She easily finds the rhythm of this place while Lewis struggles to find his own equilibrium.  There is little solace to be found as the cracks within their relationship start multiplying. Meanwhile, Myron (Sam Dillon) struggles with homelessness and in desperation gets caught up in the dealings of a local criminal involved in human trafficking named Doughboy (Leonard Earle Howze). The filmmakers make a lot of effort to avoid treating the black residents of the island as empty caricatures or vessels for uplifting platitudes meant to assuage the leads. The music, culture and cuisine of the island is authentically rendered. The strongest aspect of the film is the cinematography by Daniella Nowitz, it's black-and-white images lending a painterly quality to the narrative that at times makes \u201cLive Cargo\u201d seem mythic. This subverts any expectations when it comes to stories taking place in the Bahamas. There\u2019s no pastel or neon color palette. But this rich imagery can\u2019t conceal that there is no emotion to be found in this story. How can a film that touches on child loss, yearning to belong, murder, and human trafficking be so hollow? It\u2019s clear Sandler and his collaborators are fans of Michelangelo Antonioni. More than once I thought of the molasses-slow pace and the melancholy of \"L\u2019Eclisse.\" Unfortunately, the filmmakers confuse a lack of dialogue with verisimilitude and the actors casting sorrowful faces as having a perspective on human emotion. The film is as beautiful and thin as a cleverly-photographed postcard.  The actors are definitely dedicated to their roles. But what causes \u201cLive Cargo\u201d to falter is that Dree Hemingway and Lakeith Stanfield have no chemistry; not once is there a sense that these two people share a profound history. Stanfield has proven to be a compelling actor with recent fare like \"Atlanta,\" \"Get Out\" and \"Miles Ahead,\" so it's surprising just how miscalculated his performance feels here. In trying to communicate the sorrow that is weighing Lewis down and warping his marriage, he pushes too hard, making the character come across as apathetic. Hemingway has neither the fierceness nor complexity necessary to fill in the blanks that the filmmakers don\u2019t consider about a woman who lost her first child. There\u2019s also a queasiness to the sexual dynamic between Lewis and Nadine that isn\u2019t addressed. Each time he tries to have sex, she recoils. Lewis doesn\u2019t consider how Nadine may not be ready to have another child or comfortable initiating their sex life again. But her perspective isn\u2019t fleshed out and his desire isn\u2019t taken to task. There is no emotional arc or complexity to these people, which undercuts whatever power the carefully crafted imagery occasionally taps into.  Advertisement \u201cLive Cargo\u201d does tip into somewhat offensive territory by never considering or exploring the humanity of the trafficking victims. They are merely a vehicle to solve the problems between Lewis and Nadine in a particularly ridiculous way for a narrative that makes a big show of feeling naturalistic. It seems the filmmakers, in trying to avoid an exploitative narrative, fell into the trap of not creating much of a narrative at all. The movie also curiously never considers the racial and cultural dynamics of the interracial relationship at its center or the optics of Nadine grinding on an anonymous black man at a club when her relationship with Lewis fractures further. Ultimately, \"Live Cargo\" is a film that confuses silence with great insight, beautiful imagery with emotion and the empty with the profound."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "The Color of Time", "Review": "I can tell you what \"The Color of Time\" is missing, but I can't tell you why it's not there. Based on Pulitzer Prize-winning poet C.K. Williams's autobiographical work, \"The Color of Time\" is about poetry, though it has none to speak of. It's an expressionistic drama that seems to heavily crib from the transcendental films of Terrence Malick, particularly \"The Tree of Life,\" but is realistically just as indebted and influenced by the poetry of Rimbaud and William Blake, both of whom are cited as influences by one of the film's four different versions of Williams (James Franco). The makers of \"The Color of Time,\" a cabal of twelve co-directors and co-writers, therefore focus on small gestures that are supposed to reveal Williams's main concern: how do you express meaning without language, but rather just through expression, and sensations? Sadly, by trying so hard to alchemically change small gestures into big ones, the film's creators suck the soul out of their film. \"The Color of Time\" has considerable ambition, but no inner life. Advertisement Throughout \"The Color of Time,\" actor James Franco provides voiceover narration, guiding us through fragmented memories of Williams' past. That episodic, non-linear plot is one of many ways that the film's creators try to give viewers the sense that the fictionalized experiences they're seeing are authentic reflections of Williams's subjective memory.\u00a0Williams similarly tells us at the start of the film that his poems are written in long verses since he wants to try to replicate the way people speak.\u00a0The film's story is consequently a chain of pseudo-sensual experiences, like when a college-aged Williams (now Henry Hopper) drops acid, or when a teenage Williams (now Jordan March) sleeps with a prostitute.\u00a0 That needle-drop approach to Williams's personal history isn't necessarily misguided, but it feels that way given the consistently uninvolving nature of \"The Color of Time\". Each episode drips with easy sentimentality, from the sepia-toned camera filter that makes everything look like a fading photograph to the serial abuse of extreme close-ups, the kind that leave everything out-of-focus but, say, a pair of hands clasping, or a drunken come-hither smile. \"The Color of Time\" is accordingly a frustrating work of fourth-hand romanticism: the right gestures are here, but they're presented as if they're inherently meaningful. Take for example Williams' unexamined fascination with women. He loves his wife (Mila Kunis), or so Williams (Franco, again) tells us at film's end when, through his poetry, he expresses his thanks for having found a partner with whom to share his life. But what about an earlier scene where Williams recalls the matron that offers him a meal (he declines) but doesn't remember--or maybe doesn't want to admit he remembers--the face of the woman that he paid to give him oral pleasure? It's a troubling scene since its implications are completely unchallenged. We see Williams protest and flee the room, but we don't see the woman's face, and we never really know why.\u00a0 Advertisement That, presumably, is the film's point: Williams' life has recurring concerns, but no authoritative trajectory. It is, in other words, deliberately vague in parts, and therefore willfully frustrating. Each scene accordingly feels like an assembly-line version of \"The Tree of Life.\" Close-ness is often conflated with real-ness, as we see in the film's myriad fuzzy close-ups, and hear in Franco's conspiratorial, unmoving voiceover narration, taken from Williams' poems. Likewise, watching a seven year-old Williams (now Zachary Unger) ask a girl \"Where are you going,\" and seeing her reply \"Where are you going\" is just as meaningless as the scene where Franco's Williams discovers a wounded horse in a forest, and presses his palm against its neck.\u00a0 Of course, \"The Color of Time\" wouldn't have to mean anything if it were simply moving. I won't ascribe bad faith to a movie whose creators' vision is clearly too myopic to match their lofty goals. But, while I can see the earthy, exultant film that the makers of \"The Color of Time\" wanted to make, the film they delivered often feels phony."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Diary of a Wimpy Kid", "Review": "It is so hard to do a movie like this well. \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" is a PG-rated comedy about the hero's first year of middle school, and it's nimble, bright and funny. It doesn't dumb down. It doesn't patronize. It knows something about human nature. It isn't as good as \"A Christmas Story,\" as few movies are, but it deserves a place in the same sentence. Here is a family movie you don't need a family to enjoy. You must, however, have been a wimpy kid. Most kids are wimpy in their secret hearts. Those that never were grow up to be cage fighters. Advertisement Greg Heffley isn't the shortest student in his class. That would be Chirag Gupta. Greg (Zachary Gordon) is only the second shortest. He's at that crucial age when everybody else has started to grow. There's a funny slide show illustrating how his class looked in sixth grade, and how they look now -- some with mustaches. The girls of course are taller than the boys. The onset of adolescence is an awkward age, made marginally easier for Greg because he still hasn't developed an interest in girls. Even his best friend Rowley (Robert Capron) is flattered to be noticed by a girl, and Rowley is so out of it, he thinks that at his age kids still \"play,\" when, as we all know, they \"hang.\" The girl who notices Greg and Rowley is Angie (Chloe Moretz), who seems wise beyond her years. We first see her under the bleachers, reading Howl by Allen Ginsberg. Keep your eye on her in high school. She looks way older than her two new friends, but I checked, and Moretz was only 12 when she made the movie. In middle school, we find cliques, cruelty and bullying. The pack is poised to pounce. \"Diary\" is especially funny about a slice of Swiss cheese that was dropped on a playground sometime in the distant past and has grown an alarming coating of mold. Some kid poked it once, and all the other kids avoided him like the plague. He had the dreaded Cheese Touch. He only got rid of it by touching another kid. Then that kid had the Touch, until -- and so on. The cheese nicely symbolizes the hunger kids have for an excuse, any excuse, to make other kids pariahs. Remember what happened to anyone who wore green on a Thursday? Where do they find these actors? They come up on TV, I guess. Chloe Moretz has been acting since she was 7. Zachary Gordon has the confidence and timing of an old pro; he plays wimpy as if it's a desirable character trait. Robert Capron, as his pudgy best friend Rowley, pulls off the tricky fear of being an inch or two taller than Greg, and yet still childish; wait until you see his Halloween costume. Greg's parents (Rachael Harris and Steve Zahn) aren't major characters, because what happens in school consumes all of Greg's psychic energy. His older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) is of course a sadistic teaser who makes life miserable. But at that age, so it goes. The movie is inspired by the books of Jeff Kinney, and the titles reproduce his hand-lettering and drawing style. The movie reproduces his charm. The director, Thor Freudenthal, made \"Hotel for Dogs\" (2009), received affectionately in some circles, but this time, his touch is more sure and his humor more sunny. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Bewakoofiyaan", "Review": "The main takeaway from \"Bewakoofiyaan,\" the latest from the Yash Raj assembly line, is that there are very few things in cinema that can't be solved by a genuine star performance. Neither Ayushmann Khuranna or Sonam Kapoor gives one here: they're both perfectly pleasant, attractive\r\nyoung people who are cute together and have a functional amount of romantic chemistry, if slightly generic. In fact, in romantic comedy, it's actually a handicap if one or the other of the leads is disproportionately better than the other, since in the end romantic comedies are about couples, not two individuals. No, the star turn, and the only major element in \"Bewakoofiyaan\" that transcends the by-the-numbers assembly line rom-com, is Rishi Kapoor. Advertisement Every inch a star these last forty-plus years, Rishi Kapoor's great gift is his alchemical ability to make the act of collecting a paycheck seem like a magical glimpse into the very heart of creation itself. Even more than usual, his turn in \"Bewakoofiyaan\" is so large it becomes the sole source of momentum for the movie as a whole. The central couple, as above, is merely functional, as are Habib Faisal's script and Nupur Asthana's direction. Rishi rises above all this, not merely chewing scenery but swallowing large parts of it whole, in the fairly standard role of \"disapproving father of the female lead.\" \"Bewakoofiyaan\" does, in one other ultimately secondary way, make an attempt at being something \"more\" than a romantic comedy, in its use of the global economic recession as a source of\r\ndramatic conflict. Khuranna is Mohit, an upwardly mobile marketing executive until his employer decides his post-promotion salary is fiscally not viable and lays him off. Sonam Kapoor is his fiancee Mayera, a successful corporate up-and-comer in her own right. Rishi is her father, V.K., a career bureaucrat who wants to marry her off to a rich guy. V.K. does not like Mohit, although the latter sets about proving himself worthy, even if it involves elaborate subterfuges to make it seem as though he's still employed. To give credit where due, one of \"Bewakoofiyaan\"'s assets as a romantic comedy is its self-awareness, expressed through Mohit, about lying being such an omnipresent and unpleasant facet of the genre, circa 2014. He lies as little about his circumstances as he can, choosing instead to deflect inconvenient questions. Still, his excessive, self-destructive pride in his previous status as a hotshot executive counteracts what little sympathy his honesty generates, and even if that weren't an issue, Khurrana gets blown off the screen by Rishi Kapoor. Sonam has little to do except buy shoes, be supportive, and look pretty (the latter most prominently in a gratuitous and kind of silly bikini scene), and thus her thespian abilities are not overtaxed. Advertisement It should be noted that nothing about \"Bewakoofiyaan\" is unpleasant. Even the slightly overlong obligatory \"serious\" part is over soon enough, and we're back to Rishi Kapoor walking around saying funny things and mugging. The movie is perfectly acceptable middle-of-the-road romantic comedy material, and for fans of such things it should certainly hit the spot. Still, \"Bewakoofiyaan\" is decidedly more a product than it is a film, per se. Considering that it has little pretense at being anything else, that's an eminently acceptable state of affairs."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Mr. Peabody & Sherman", "Review": "I'm not convinced that the world really needed a big budget, 3-D, feature-length reboot of the adventures of Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman, but here it is. \u00a0It's better than OK, and a few elements sing; but overall it frustrates. Its delights come from its willingness to depart from formula, but formula still rules it.  The picture is based on the classic Jay Ward shorts that used to appear on Rocky and Bullwinkle's animated variety show, back during TV's late jurassic period. The film's director Rob Minkoff (\"The Lion King\") and his screenwriter Craig Wright (\"Lost\") don't knock themselves out trying to replicate every nuance. They've kept the central relationship between a genius dog (Ty Burrell) and his adopted human son (Max Charles), plus the time machine they travel in, and a few of Mr. Peabody's brazenly horrible puns (at one point the pooch tells his boy that Egypt's pyramids were designed by \"some old Giza\"). Everything else, though, has been ginned up, seemingly to bring \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" in line with American studio animation's unofficial house style. I'm referring to a familiar set of qualities developed during the Disney renaissance of the late '80s and early '90s, and perfected, if that is the word, by the \"Shrek\" series, and movies in a \"Shrek\"-like vein. Advertisement On Ward's series, the draughtsmanship was simple, and the characters were so barely-animated that they seemed to slide across the screen, like figures in a pop-up book. This movie, in contrast, goes for the glitzy, the state-of-the-art. The designs are highly stylized, but with incongruous elements. The realistic shadings and blockbuster action-film-style (virtual) camerawork seem at odds with the movie's Eisenhower-Kennedy era cars, clothes, hairstyles and architecture; ditto the characters with their Ward-style bobble-heads and sticklike bodies and arms. When Danny Elfman's sprightly-bombastic score swells and Mr. Peabody and Sherman zoom through snaky time-space wormholes a la \"Star Trek\" or \"Contact,\" or race out of a collapsing tomb, or body surf through a network of sewer tunnels just ahead of raging flood waters or flame-clouds, it's as if rather slight source material had been injected with a hyper-dose of steroids that made it balloon grotesquely, creating bulges where bulges shouldn't be.\u00a0 The humor seems off as well. The original show had a distinctively goofy and wry sensibility. It mixed historical factoids and Borscht Belt tomfoolery, with Mr. Peabody educating his boy Sherman on the culture and history of whatever society they happened to be disrupting, then getting them out of jams via Sherlock Holmes-style displays of icy super-competence. There's a fair bit of that in here, and it's marvelous. Peabody's math-driven approach to travel and escape is visualized with onscreen graphics, arrows and equations, and\u00a0the name of Mr. Peabody's fancy mixed drink \"Einstein on the Beach\" is funny on at least two levels. It's hard to imagine how Ty Burrell's vocal performance as Peabody could be improved. Everything about it is exquisitely judged, from the way he sprints through Peabody's scientific exposition, but never so quickly that he confuses the viewer, to the way he unveils the dog's wretched puns (in Peabody's mind, he's underplaying the jokes, but to anyone listening, he's hammering them).\u00a0 Considering that the movie's\u00a0subtlest achievements are its most impressive, it's too bad that \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" felt obligated to be \"awesome\" every single second. \u00a0As \"The Lego Movie\" taught us, \"awesome\" has become a code word that means, \"Let's collectively agree to pretend this isn't the same old thing we always experience, so that we don't feel sad and cheated.\"\u00a0The problem isn't that the film is badly executed (by every current industry yardstick, it's aces) but that the filmmakers have taken something uncategorizable and revised in ways that make it more like everything else in multiplexes. The noise and scale mean that Ward's characters have to fight to seem charming and special, even though in quiet scenes you never question their charming specialness. \u00a0 Advertisement The film also displays a puzzling tone-deafness towards other eras and cultures, and towards women and girls. An early action sequence set in Egypt is visually splendid and has an agreeable \"History of the World, Part 1\" silliness (Mel Brooks makes the connection official with a vocal cameo later in the film, as Sigmund Freud). It's capped by a magnificently absurd routine in which the hero impersonates a god. But this same sequence trades in white-girl-imperiled-by-creepy-brown-men images. It also digs the film deeper into a sexist pit that I hoped it wouldn't fall into, even though the warning signs appear early. Sherman's classmate and academic rival Penny Peterson (Ariel Winter) is nothing more than a grade-school version of Tracy Flick from \"Election,\" prideful and spiteful and shallow where Sherman is humble, considerate and soulful. \u00a0When she goes to Peabody and Sherman's house with her parents, she becomes an even more irritating character, losing the grating competitiveness that made her dynamic as well as unlikable. She manipulates Peabody into showing her Sherman's time machine (against daddy dog's instructions) then gets kidnapped by the boy version of King Tut, mesmerized by his wealth, lured into marriage and prepped for sacrifice. She's just another annoying, self-involved chick causing problems for a lovable dude.\u00a0 This is par for the gender-relations course in \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman.\" None of the other women in the movie\u2014including Penny's mom (voiced by Leslie Mann) and the plump spinster guidance counselor Miss Grunion (Allison Janney)\u2014rise above mere shrew or foil. A sequence set in Egypt that finds Peabody, Sherman and Penny cavorting with Leonardo DaVinci (Stanley Tucci) makes the film's subordination of women official. Penny launches Leonardo's flying machine (against Sherman's wishes; notice the pattern?), but rather than revel in her ability to make action happen, the sequence has Penny turn over the mechanical bird's controls to Sherman, whom she delightedly describes as the first man ever to take flight. Advertisement The film's attempts to create \"heart\" are problematic, too, though understandable. Over the past 25 years, Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks and pretty much every other studio that makes animated films have made us expect a blend of slapstick, buddy comedy and overscaled action, and maybe a song or two if it's a musical, with a bit of hugging and learning, all wrapped up in a heart-shaped bow. \u00a0The filmmakers might have worried that they couldn't sustain a Jay Ward-style cool farce for 75 minutes, even an animated one\u2014that viewers of all ages, conditioned by so many other animated pictures, would demand that their heartstrings be tugged regularly.\u00a0Thus Peabody and Sherman's relationship, which remained largely unexplained in the TV series and was more amusing for being undefined, is here transformed into a half-baked parable of social difference, with Peabody, the dog raising an orphaned human, perhaps standing in for a single or gay or unacceptably metrosexual dad, or maybe an adoptive parent of a different race. (In a flashback sequence, an African-American judge, voiced by Dennis Haysbert, grants Peabody custody of the foundling child.)\u00a0 If the movie had gone all the way with this notion and converted subtext into text, it might have distinguished itself as a total re-imagining of its source, rather than a mildly eccentric version of the same-old, same-old. It's a bit of a shame, really. \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" is a sweet movie, funny and essentially decent. But its failure to avoid the imaginative failures and regressive messages that plague so many other feature-length cartoons make it more disappointing, somehow, than more crass, mechanical film might have been. The eccentric touches give you hope for the movie. The movie dashes them."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Pusher", "Review": "Being a drug pusher is a horrible job, which has failure and misery built in. It depends on people who must have drugs and sooner or later will not be able to afford them. Because the drugs create a brief state of euphoria, they dig a hole for themselves in their souls and pull failure in after them. How many drug pushers have I seen, in how many movies? They all seem versions of the same species. They exude a certain cool in their social circles, because they are a source of euphoria for others. They are invariably users themselves. They are the vulnerable middle man between the distributors and the users, running most of the risks, because it is a greater crime to sell than to use. When they can't pay a debt to their supplier, that is the most dangerous of all crimes, because suppliers tend to be ruthless sadists flanked by cold-eyed enforcers.  Advertisement Luis Prieto's \"Pusher\" is a new U.K. remake of a 1996 success by the hot Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (\"Drive\"). It stars Richard Coyle in the story of seven days in the life of Frank, a London dealer \u2014 days that grow remorselessly more miserable as a noose of debt tightens around his neck. He gets what seems to be a safe order for a kilo of cocaine. This information is his fortune. He knows he can obtain the cocaine from Milo (Zlatko Buric), a superficially charming clothing importer. \"You're like a son to me,\" Milo tells Frank, urging him to sample honeyed Serbian desserts. As an actor, Zlatko Buric embodies a smarmy charm that is reptilian \u2014 as Frank discovers when he loses the cocaine and Milo's \u00a345,000. Now the cold-eyed enforcers start turning up, popping their knuckles and dropping hints about cutting off Frank's fingers. This is the second movie I've seen in a few days involving finger amputation. Charming, these people. Frank's circle includes his mistress, Flo (Agyness Deyn), and his goofy buddy, Tony (Bronson Webb). As a general rule, when a woman says she loves you and she's getting her drugs from you, it may not be true love. As for Tony, anyone with that giggle cannot be trusted. Frank glides through a lifestyle involving discos and pole-dancing clubs with flashing red lights, grotty back streets in charmless London districts, increasingly desperate meetings with people who cannot think of any good reason they should \"lend\" you thousands of pounds, and drinkers who, as usual in recent low-life films, pound back straight shots that have no apparent effect. I'm thinking of keeping count of movies without mixed drinks. It's more or less expected that a London type like Frank will have at least one good guy in his life, possibly a souvenir from his younger days, and in \"Pusher,\" that character is a nice old man who runs a pet shop; what happens to him provides the film's most genuinely shocking moment.  Richard Coyle's weary, baggy eyes record his mounting desperation, Flo's beauty disguises a woman on hold for her next hit of crack, Tony is too much of an innocent to run in these circles, and if we haven't caught on from earlier films that drug pushing is a thankless persuasion, maybe this is the movie that will pound in the lesson.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Call", "Review": "Brad Anderson (\"Session 9,\" \"The Machinist,\" \"Transsiberian\") is a capable genre craftsman with a good eye for shadowy atmosphere. In addition to directing features, Anderson has built a rock-solid side career as a prolific TV director. Even Anderson's lesser films \u2014 like \"Vanishing on 7th Street,\" a sort of watered-down John Carpenter movie \u2014 have been surefooted. That, unfortunately, can't be said about his latest movie, \"The Call,\"  a sputtering, so-so B thriller with a neat hook but very little personality. Advertisement Halle Berry stars as an operator at a 911 call center in Los Angeles. Dressed in a poodle wig and polo shirt, Berry spends most of the movie seated behind a desk. Her world \u2014 \"the Hive,\" as her co-workers call it \u2014 is compact and work-centric. Even her boyfriend, a handsome LAPD officer (Morris Chestnut), is a colleague. A framed photo glimpsed briefly in her apartment suggests that she comes from a police family. \"The Call\" opens with a bird's eye view of the city and a montage of operators answering 911 calls \u2014 some frivolous, some serious. Then the movie \u2014 which, if nothing else, is briskly-paced \u2014 gets right to setting up the plot. Berry answers a home invasion call from a teenage girl and makes a minor but critical mistake which leads to the girl's kidnapping. The next day, her body is found in a shallow grave. Berry's colleagues don't fault her for the misstep, but she nonetheless resigns from answering calls to focus on training new operators. Six months later, she's leading a group of trainees through their first tour of the Hive when a call comes in from a teenage girl (Abigail Breslin) who has been abducted and locked in the trunk of a car. The operator who answers doesn't know how to handle the call and veteran Berry reluctantly takes over. Breslin explains that she's been nabbed from a mall parking lot by an unknown man, and that the trunk she's in contains a shovel \u2014 suggesting that her abductor intends to kill and bury her. Of course, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that the man who has kidnapped Breslin is the same one who abducted and killed the teenage girl six months earlier. Played by a twitchy, hammy Michael Eklund, he's a stock weirdo serial-killer type. He likes cheesy music (when Breslin wakes up in his trunk, he's blasting Taco's \"Puttin' on the Ritz\"). He's panicky and easily spooked. For a guy who has a whole underground bunker devoted to torturing blonde teenagers, he seems very poorly prepared. At the center of \"The Call\"'s premise is the mobile phone Breslin is calling from. It's one of those cheap, pay-as-you-go disposables, which means that the call center can't trace it. Also, the car is in motion; neither Breslin nor Berry can pinpoint her location. Technical impossibility aside (disposable cellphones are traceable), it makes for a cool cat-and-mouse premise: Breslin and Berry must conspire to outwit the serial killer without knowing exactly where he is or where he's headed. Advertisement All it would take to pull off this conceit is a little filmmaking imagination and a firm grip on form. Unfortunately, \"The Call\" has neither. Much of the movie is bland-looking and flat. The endless shots circling Berry at her desk as she yells and cries into a headset grow monotonous. The premise may suggest claustrophobia \u2014 Berry stuck at her desk, Breslin stuck in the trunk \u2014 but \"The Call\" is too spatially wonky to be tense. Thrillers don't make themselves; it's a genre where an absence of style is synonymous with an absence of entertainment. Anderson tries to spice things up with some flashy flourishes \u2014 freeze-frames, for example \u2014 but these do nothing except to suggest a filmmaker overcomplicating a simple problem. In many ways, \"The Call\" resembles Joel Schumacher's \"Phone Booth\" (2002) \u2014 another movie with a strong, simple premise ruined by execution (interestingly, Schumacher was originally slated to direct \"The Call\"). However, \"Phone Booth\" was at least campy enough to be fun. The best \"The Call\" can manage is Eklund's bug-eyed performance \u2014 a piece of acting that's less calculating psychopath and more freaked-out acid causality. Oddly, as the screenplay \u2014 by Richard D'Ovidio, whose last credit was for the Steven Seagal/DMX vehicle \"Exit Wounds\" (2001) \u2014 gets dumber, the movie gets better, or at least more confident. The final act of \"The Call\" finds the movie betraying its premise by having Berry venture out of the Hive to find Eklund's hideout and rescue Breslin. At this point, \"The Call\" devolves into a grindhouse-style rape-revenge movie. The conclusion is silly and morally questionable, even by exploitation movie standards. It does, however, allow Anderson to do what he's good at: orchestrating dark, claustrophobic horror. For its final fifteen or so minutes, \"The Call\" rises above hackwork. Unfortunately, it doesn't rise very far."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Carrie", "Review": "\"What did Carrie White ever do to you?\" That question is asked more than once in \"Carrie,\" and it cuts to the heart of this new adaptation. Where Brian DePalma's 1976 version of Stephen King's novel was a teenage girl's nightmare as seen through the eyes of a straight male voyeur, this one looks through a wider lens, and strikes more universal notes of sympathy. (Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers ahead.)  This Carrie White (played by Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz of the \"Kick-Ass\" films) is more conventionally pretty than the scrawny, big-eyed misfit played by Sissy Spacek in DePalma's classic. Her gawkiness is internalized. It's a product of her horrid home life, and the knowledge that she has undefined powers that make her different from other kids, and that they're flowering along with the onset of puberty, and that her mother Margaret (Julianne Moore) sees them as signs of evil, rather than world-changing human potential. In this scenario it does not matter whether Carrie is conventionally \"pretty\" or \"not pretty.\"  Because Carrie is an abused child, she feels ugly; because she feels ugly, she radiates a sense of worthlessness.   Advertisement Carrie's body-shame was handed down by her mom, who's first seen in a prologue giving birth to Carrie, then briefly considering killing her with the same scissors she will ultimately use to cut the cord. (Peirce's staging of the birth\u2014complete with first-person shot of the infant's soft head resting on bloody sheets\u2014is original, and Moore's acting has a silent-movie purity.) In contrast to DePalma's version, Carrie's mom seems less a standard-issue, frothing-at-the-mouth \"religious nut\" movie character than a mentally ill single mom, eking out a living as a seamstress and dry cleaner. Moore's Margaret is a purely pitable figure who scratches and cuts her own flesh, and who cannot love herself, let alone a child. As far as Carrie knows, this is a normal home life.   For all the psychological realism of Carrie and Margaret's relationship, however, this remake has a comic book feeling. Peirce has turned \"Carrie\" into dark, sick take on a superhero origin story, complete with wide-angle lenses and God's-eye-view shots and poetic sound effects (when Margaret is near, Carrie \"hears\" her before she sees her, thanks to a high-pitched whine that's like a dog whistle). Whole sequences have a Clark-Kent-in-Smallville feeling. What would have become of Superman had he been a girl raised by an insane single parent? He'd might have endured being called a freak for years until he finally snapped and roasted the football team. The film treats the school's gym teacher Miss Desjardin (Judy Greer)\u2014who punishes Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday), leader of the girls who torture Carrie\u2014as Carrie's shadow \"good\" mother. Her kindness is a heartening alternative to Margaret's paranoia, unthinking cruelty, and emotional dislocation. When Carrie spares Miss Desjardin from the prom rampage, lifting her off a dance floor that she's about to fill with corpses, it's one of the most perversely touching gestures in a movie filled with them. Advertisement Perhaps because this \"Carrie\" is helmed by one of the only prominent female directors in Hollywood, Kimberly Peirce (\"Boys Don't Cry\"), it appreciates Carrie and her mother and the heroine's various female adversaries as women, and portrays their brand of cruelty as specifically female. For example, where the girls in the 1976 \"Carrie\" tormented the menstruating heroine in the shower in a wolf-pack manner, as teenaged boys might attack another teenage boy, the shower attack in this film is a joke that originates in embarrassment and nausea, then snowballs. (Peirce doesn't show nudity; this time it's all about the girls' emotions.)\u00a0 Peirce and screenwriters Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa give the whole film this kind of heartfelt, inside-out re-imagining. Class differences play a part in Carrie's mistreatment; a few early shots establish that Carrie and Margaret live far from the obviously privileged high school, in a modest neighborhood. And as the tale nears its inevitable climax, the tone becomes more despairing. Nothing can stop what's coming. It's on this last point, though, that \"Carrie\" falters most conspicuously\u2014and ironically, its failure is a product of its decision to depart from the novel and the first film, but without going far enough. Peirce's version sometimes makes Chris seem a bit of a victim, too, by implying that she was spoiled rotten by her yuppie dad\u2014played by a perfectly cast Hart Bochner, a.k.a. Ellis from \"Die Hard.\" This is a good impulse, but the movie doesn't properly follow through on it. The script has Chris be exaggeratedly \"evil\" when it serves the plot, but life-sized elsewhere.\u00a0This version strands the supporting characters between realism and archetype, an awkward spot.\u00a0 Still, there's a lot to like in this remake. It's sincerely interested in exploring the pain that its characters suffer and inflict. And when Carrie unleashes the full brunt of her powers, it's a magnificent and appalling spectacle\u2014the teenage sci-fi rampage that the \"X-Men\" films never dared show us.  Not for nothing does Carrie check out library books on magic as well as paranormal power: when she becomes a gore-drenched avenging angel, her gestures become more ritualized, almost dancer-like\u2014as if she's not just committing gruesome murders, but in some sense \"presenting\" them, as a performer might. The movie links Carrie's burgeoning power to creativity, watching her develop her gifts until, at the end, she is assured enough to preside over a combination Grand Guignol play and art exhibit. The prom is a masterpiece of mixed-media slaughter, \"Hellraiser\" by way of Columbine. Each killing is a discrete work employing different media and techniques: death by psychic assault, by trampling, by electrocution, by fire, by face-through-glass. As Walter Chaw writes, \"Peirce's Carrie does something DePalma's doesn't do nearly so well: it describes Carrie's headspace, so that her telekinesis becomes expressionistic.\"   Advertisement Curiously, for such a secular movie, this \"Carrie\" lends Biblical significance to every blood drop spilled. Original sin is never far from its mind. Margaret's original sin was having sex with Carrie's father, an event she describes as a violation. The community's original sin was attacking Carrie in the shower, humiliating her for manifesting signs of Eve's \"curse.\" After that, they were thrown out of the garden of their innocence, or ignorance; each counterplot or attempt to make amends is a doomed attempt to return to the garden. Carrie's original sin was being born. She is born again at the prom, kills the woman who gave birth to her, and dies that very night. The first \"Carrie\" was horror. This is tragedy."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Haute Cuisine", "Review": "The word I kept thinking of while watching \"Haute Cuisine\" was \"brisk,\" as in a brisk walk. This movie keeps up a vigorous pace and carries you along on the force of its self-confidence. A journalist and her cameraman arrive at French research station in the Antarctic to shoot what looks like a fairly mundane story, until she spots the only other woman on the island, who is at the dock to check out the foodstuffs that have arrived. When one of the men explains that this is their cook, and that she used to be the personal chef of the President of France, the journo snaps to attention. \"Film her!\" And we're off. Advertisement After a few quick scenes in the research station's kitchen, where Hortense Laborie (Catherine Frot) is making incredibly elaborate food, we're thrown into flashback. Hortense is being whisked from her truffle farm in a government car to catch a train to Paris. Someone in government wants a chef, but precisely whom that would be has been left vague. Bang, we're in Paris, where Hortense learns that she is being offered the job of personal chef to President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand. The music, the snappy script and the editing have carried us along so quickly it feels almost like a thriller. The thrills will come, but in the form of glossy reductions, plump escargot, rich duck breasts layered with delicately cooked vegetables, a cream cheese treat that requires straining through a mesh made of a particular grass. Like \"Big Night,\" this is a food lover's movie. But while that movie luxuriated in the food, this one embraces the kinetic energy of kitchen creation. Honestly, not much happens. Laborie meets the president (Jean D'Ormesson), a gentle soul nostalgic for the food of his youth. She spars with the pompous chef who runs the \"main kitchen\" of the Palais, the one that serves up hundreds of meals for the staff (a kitchen notably staffed exclusively by men). She battles Mitterand's dieticians, who want to put the frail old man on a low-fat diet (Quelle horreur!). She leaves. It's all interspersed with scenes in the Antarctic, where she prepares the last meals for the crew before she departs at the end of her year as their cook.  The real fascination here is twofold. First, it's just darn fun to watch her cook. I have no idea whether Catherine Frot is doing things right or not in terms of kitchen technique, but I'd watch her layer a stuffed cabbage all day. And when she samples the work of her sous chef Nicholas (Arthur Dupont), trying to decide whether this bite is something she would serve to Mitterand, her face takes on a look as if she is listening to distant music. Frot makes Laborie (who is \"inspired by\" the real Mitterand chef Dani\u00e8le Mazet-Delpeuch) a fascinating enigma, supremely elegant in her sweater sets and pearls but with a backbone of steel. There's a wonderful scene early on (to pick one from many), when she is offered the position and at first declines because, she says, she's not worthy. Frot conveys something incredibly complex. It's not some coy false modesty. She knows she's a damn fine chef. It seems that she is assessing herself and thinks there are better people for the job. But even under that layer there's something else: She's shrewd about power dynamics, even if she ignores them when playing the game gets in the way of good cooking. All of that comes across in perhaps ten seconds. Advertisement The film gets a lot of gentle chuckles out of the way food is treated as deadly serious business in the French presidential palace. And a palace it is. The butlers still wear tails, none of the president's staff would ever be seen in anything less than a suit, and the menu for lunch can achieve the level of state crisis. When Hortense and Mitterand settle in for a chat about cookbooks and recipes, his staff scurries around in the hallway like terrified hens, rescheduling the presidential plane's takeoff to accommodate this unexpected delay. Breezy, brisk, vigorous. These aren't words one would automatically associate with a foodie film, but they're meant as praise. Though a woman of Hortense's cool elegance would never say it, she has a heck of a ride as Mitterand's chef, and it's fun to be along for it."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "A Single Shot", "Review": "An odd mix of beautifully bleak atmosphere and hammily mannered performances, \"A Single Shot\" is simultaneously understated and overpowering.  This backwoods neo-noir is the latest film from director David M. Rosenthal, who drew some honest moments out of sheer formula in the 2011 drama \"Janie Jones,\" about an estranged father and daughter who connect by playing rock music together. \"A Single Shot,\" which Matthew F. Jones wrote based on his novel of the same name, is actually at its most effective when no one says anything at all.  Advertisement The first 14 minutes of the film are essentially wordless, with the detailed sound design and cold, blue images of early-morning West\r\nVirginia telling the story. A dog barks. Birds chirp. Cows moo. And Sam Rockwell\u2019s clunky boots crunch on the ground as he illegally hunts deer in the woods around his trailer home. (Spaniard Edward Grau, who shot Tom Ford's gorgeous \"A Single Man,\" is the cinematographer.) With his camouflage baseball cap, scruffy beard and stoic demeanor, Rockwell's character, John Moon, is clearly a man who has fallen on hard times and is struggling to survive. But when he sees movement in the trees and pulls the trigger on his shotgun, he ends up hitting and killing a young woman instead. Naturally, he panics\u2014but as he scrambles to stash the body, he finds her makeshift campsite, which includes a box filled with cash.  In the tradition of films like \"No Country for Old Men\" and \"A Simple Plan,\" in which ordinary folks find themselves in extraordinary circumstances by making one dangerous decision after another, John takes the money, then finds himself the target of increasingly menacing threats.  His theft is understandable, given that he's lost the family dairy farm to foreclosure and his diner-waitress wife, Jess (an underused Kelly Reilly), has taken off with their young son. He's trying to get back on the right track. But clearly the money belongs to someone, and not a good someone, which leads to a parade of actors (most of them Brits) doing garbled Southern accents in tattoos and trashy clothes.  Among them are Joe Anderson as a sinewy crackhead with the ominous name of Obadiah and Jason Isaacs as an omnipresent sadist named Waylon. Jeffrey Wright shows up in a couple of scenes as John's only friend, the hard-partying Simon, but the character is so drunk so often that it's often impossible to tell what he's saying. This is especially problematic given that his main function seems to be arriving in the third act to explain to John the intertwined allegiances of the various small-town scuzzballs who are after him. Advertisement Also crammed into the cast is William H. Macy, who may be a villain or just an opportunist. He plays a longtime lawyer with the impossibly folksy name of Daggard Pitt. With his plaid sport coat, floral tie, cheap toupee, disabled arm and limping gait, he's\u00a0more a collection of quirks and tics than a real person. Even an actor of Macy's experience and versatility can\u2019t make this character feel like flesh and blood.  Macy's presence is actually a hindrance in some ways. Rosenthal has cited Joel and Ethan Coen among the many esteemed filmmakers who\r\ninfluenced him here. The fact that Macy starred memorably in one of the greatest of the Coens' films, \"Fargo,\" only reminds us of the inferiority of \"A Single Shot.\" But it's always good to see Rockwell. Always. Speaking of versatility, he really can do anything. The gruff and gravelly John Moon is an unusually low-key role for him\u2014especially compared to his swaggering, scene-stealing supporting turn this summer in \"The Way Way Back\"\u2014but he conveys a great deal about his character in small, subtle ways.  Subtle is not a word you would use to describe \"A Single\r\nShot,\" though, as it reaches its climactic conclusion\u2014and in case we couldn't figure out for ourselves that lives are at stake, the screechy, insistent score from Icelandic composer Atli Orvarsson spells everything out for us."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Way, Way Back", "Review": "The hero of \"The Way, Way Back\" is named Duncan. He's fourteen. He has the posture of a boiled shrimp. He walks like an old man with an untreated hernia. He rarely speaks, not because he has nothing to say, but because he's terrified of sounding stupid, immature or uncool. He's one of the most physically awkward young men in the history of coming-of-age movies, and if you've seen even a couple of examples from this genre, you know what an achievement that is. As written by the filmmaking team of Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (screenwriters of \"The Descendants\"), and as performed by star Liam James, the kid is as hard to watch as he is easy to sympathize with. At times he seems on the verge of literally crawling out of his own skin and leaving a husk behind.  Advertisement \"The Way, Way Back\" is about The Summer that Changed Everything. While vacationing at a beach house with his divorced mother, Pam (Toni Collette), her quietly domineering new boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell) and Trent's rhymes-with-witchy teenage daughter Steph (Zoe Levin), Duncan musters the courage to stand up for himself and his rather meek mom. He gets his first real job at a water park run by a talkative, funny, lovable flake named Owen (Sam Rockwell). He learns to have a semi-comfortable conversation with a lovely neighbor girl (AnnaSophia Robb of \"The Carrie Diaries\"). He even dances, stiffly, and learns to be cool, if \"cool\" is a synonym for \"not obviously miserable.\"  As you may have guessed, all the triumphs in this film are relative to Duncan's starting place. That's what makes \"The Way, Way Back\" feel somewhat special, even though you've seen its component parts before, and the parts don't always fit together naturally.  There's humiliation on the home front. Trent isn't an ogre, but he's far from Prince Charming. Oedipal conflicts aside, our hero has legitimate reasons to hate him. The film's skillful opening sequence sets the tone for their relationship: as the women slumber in the car en route to Trent's summer home, he demands that Duncan rate himself on a one-to-ten scale. Trent is represented solely through shots of his eyes reflected in the car's rearview mirror. This technique puts us in the hero's shoes, and visually as well as verbally establishes that this movie is about getting over the obsession with how others see you, and deciding to see yourself more charitably. It's no coincidence that Robb's character, Susannah \u2014 the daughter of Trent's summer neighbor, the boozy, pushy divorcee Betty (Allison Janney) \u2014 warms to Duncan in direct proportion to how much Duncan warms to himself.  And then there's the early '80s comedy portion of \"The Way, Way Back,\" which is successful, too, if more problematic. Duncan and Owen's awkward teen/man-boy mentor shtick evokes 1979's \"Meatballs,\" which I'll bet the filmmakers can quote from memory. The Murray-esque Owen is thirty-something, but acts like a goodhearted teenage nice-guy jock who stumbled into a position of influence. The movie asks us to find it adorable when Owen and one of his employees (Faxon, who's an actor as well as a screenwriter) teach the hero how to ogle girls waiting to go down the water slide, without the girls knowing that they're being ogled. (The film portrays teenaged girls with far less sympathy than teenaged boys, Robb's girl-next-door notwithstanding.) We're also encouraged to side with Owen against the park's assistant manager Caityln (Maya Rudolph), who's constantly on Owen's back to get to work on time, observe safety regulations, and otherwise be a lame-o boring killjoy square; of course she's his sometime girlfriend, and of course she can't help loving him. At first \"The Way, Way Back\" pleads too hard for us to recognize Owen's specialness. He's the kind of guy you'd fantasize kicking in the slats if you actually had to work for him. To its credit, though, the film ultimately recognizes Owen for what he is: a sweeter, less competitive version of Trent.  Advertisement \"The Way, Way Back\" plays like a rough draft of a potentially richer, deeper film, and parts of it feel compromised. The pop culture references are but one example: the presence of the original \"Star Wars,\" REO Speedwagon, Pac-Man, Toughskin Jeans, the Soviet Union, wood-paneled station wagons and other late-20th century touchstones mark it as a story that was imagined as a period piece but had to be rewritten, perhaps for budgetary reasons. The domestic drama and water park comedy scenes coexist without ever feeling as if they're all of a piece. And I wish the movie hadn't packed Duncan's transformation into one montage. On the plus side, the movie has a cast full of actors who make decent material seem great. Collette, Carell and Rockwell all give detailed, lived-in leading performances. The supporting players make an impression, too, especially Rob Corddry and Amanda Peet as troublemaking party-animal neighbors, and Janney, who crows, \"I'm off the wagon again, accept it and move on!\" in her first scene, then goes on to give the sort of comic scene-stealing performance for which supporting actress awards were all but invented. The revelation, though, is James, who gives a performance of such naturalistic unease that just describing his screen presence is making me anxious. Will his excellence be appreciated by critics? I hope so, but if not, the actor should take it as a compliment. You couldn't pay me enough to be fourteen again. James's great acting reminded me of why."}

It\u2019s a world that seems mostly harmless, but an early\r\nshoot-out with Taliban in the hills makes it clear that the potential for danger remains. It\u2019s\r\nin this unique setting, a place that inherently feels like purgatory for those\r\nstuck there, that Cogitore crafts a tense tale of faith and mystery.  Advertisement After an encounter with a man and his sheep who get too\r\nclose to their guard post, a pair of French soldiers in Afghanistan, well,\r\ndisappear. One night, they\u2019re watching figures on the horizon. The next\r\nmorning, they are simply gone. Satellite images of the area offer no insight.\r\nThe commander, a confident man named Antar\u00e8s (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier), is naturally\r\nconvinced that they were kidnapped by local opposing forces. Through a\r\ntranslator, he interrogates the denizens of a local village, but his men have\r\nsimply vanished off the face of the Earth. He orders everyone to keep their\r\ndisappearance secret until he can figure out what is going on. Then more men\r\ndisappear. In this rock-strewn middle of nowhere, a man partnered with\r\nanother soldier in a bunker steps outside to urinate. We watch him through the\r\ndoor, knowing that danger\u2014both physical and possibly supernatural\u2014lurks over\r\nthe horizon. Our movie-watching sensibility trains us to fear for his\r\nsafety. We\u2019re in the bunker, he\u2019s out in the dangerous world. He returns to the\r\nbunker and his fellow soldier is gone. This scene really sets the tone for \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d given it\u2019s unbroken nature\u2014we know no one could have come in\r\nand kidnapped this man\u2014and the way Cogitore smartly keeps us in the bunker,\r\nwhere something happens. Exactly what that something is starts to drive Antar\u00e8s\r\ncrazy. As fear starts to overtake the soldiers underneath him, this practical\r\nleader questions what he knows as true\u2014men don\u2019t just disappear. \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d is effective more as a study of fear and failed leadership\r\nthan it is as a horror movie. In fact, if it has a weakness it\u2019s that audiences\r\nexpecting it to build to something tenser or even terrifying will be\r\ndisappointed. It drags a bit around the hour mark when it needs to be building\r\ntension and/or deepening its thematic points. There\u2019s also an underdeveloped\r\nsubplot of sleep deprivation, in that everyone becomes convinced that sleep-time is when people are taken by whatever force is removing them from this barren\r\nlandscape. Terrified and sleep-deprived in a war-torn country? There are times\r\nwhen I wanted those feelings to register more primally and emotionally than\r\nCogitore seems interested in doing. Advertisement Most of the directorial flaws and arguably wasted\r\nopportunity of the final act of \u201cNeither Heaven Nor Earth\u201d are offset by the unshowy,\r\ngrounded way in which Renier grounds the film. A regular collaborator of the\r\nDardennes brothers (\u201cL\u2019Enfant,\u201d \u201cThe Kid with a Bike\u201d), Renier has the natural\r\ncharisma of a born leader that\u2019s fascinating to see undermined by the unique\r\nsituations he finds himself in. While Cogitore generally allows viewers to\r\nplay with the film\u2019s themes to whatever degree they desire (don\u2019t all men\r\ndisappear to some extent during war, for example), Renier has to play the reality\r\nof the situation, and does so admirably. It\u2019s his plight\u2014that of a man\r\ntrained to be rational but now faced with the irrational\u2014that keeps \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d moving. And like those films that inspired it that I\r\nmentioned in the introduction, it\u2019s not the solution to the mystery that matters but\r\nwhat the mystery itself does to those who face it."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "God Knows Where I Am", "Review": "Glowing sunrises and sunsets. Long-deserted apple trees bearing pockmarked fruit. A farmhouse, gently molting its exterior paint. In \u201cGod Knows Where I Am,\u201d directors Jedd and Todd Wider employ some stunning, nostalgic-tinged cinematography\u2014shot with a variety of film cameras, including a 1939 Bell & Howell, which was used in WWII war photography\u2014to recreate the bucolic solitude that would mark the final months of Linda Bishop\u2019s life. The 50-something was found dead in May 2008, lying in the middle of the farmhouse, her shoes neatly stored beside her decomposing corpse. Bishop\u2019s suicide note was addressed to \u201cWhomever finds my body\u201d and claimed that she had been the victim of domestic violence. But it turns out the message was not a suicide letter at all. Law enforcement, some of them interviewed in the film, pieced together what happened to Bishop through a journal she left behind, in which she detailed several months of squatting in the abandoned farmhouse, waiting for her beloved \u201cSteve\u201d to come get her, and subsisting on nothing more than rain-water and apples from the nearby orchard. Advertisement How did Bishop die? Why did she die? Was she killed by an abuser? The film leaves many details of Bishop\u2019s life up in the air for a good portion of the film. Instead, for most of its running time \u201cGod Knows Where I Am\u201d narrates Bishop's four-month-long stay in the farmhouse using bits and pieces from her journal, anecdotes and details from those who knew her, and archival photography to show the woman who once was. Her journal entries are dramatized in voiceover by Lori Singer, and they make her sound quite grateful with the ascetic sanctuary she found in the farmhouse.  As soon as the film identifies her name, more talking heads\u2014friends and family members\u2014come into the picture, characterizing Bishop as a vivacious, witty and intelligent woman. She had a daughter, Caitlin Murtagh and a sister, Joan. They were her social support system. Bishop had a normal, wholesome, happy upbringing. She had friends, married and divorced once, and cared deeply for her daughter. But as more and more details about Bishop emerge from these interview clips and her journal, the more questions the film creates, yet refuses to answer. Who or what was she hiding from, exactly? Why did she think she could survive solely on apples? Her actions don\u2019t quite match the same woman her family and friends describe with glowing detail, nor does it account for the fact that a well-read, educated woman would hold a waitressing job at a Chinese restaurant. The Widers hold back the missing puzzle piece for a good hour before revealing that nobody was ever really after Bishop. She had schizoaffective disorder. By withholding this key piece of information, the Widers instead try to introduce us to Bishop as someone who\u2019s, for lack of a better term, normal\u2014and through her own words. \u201cNo luck with electric. Meter isn\u2019t running,\u201d she wrote as the weather started to change. \u201cSomething has gotta change before the cold weather comes,\u201d says a later entry. She distracted herself by devouring everything she could find in the house, including a previous tenant\u2019s report cards and college textbooks. \u201cHis creative writing is very good \u2026 ! Books, just basic freshman courses. The amount of money we had to spend on textbooks \u2026 !\u201d Advertisement The intentional hour-long omission of her severe mental illness is probably meant to endear us to Bishop through her scribing, yet her writing already paints a picture of someone with a few loose screws. By trying to humanize Bishop through this murky introduction, the Widers end up emphasizing her mental illness much more than necessary. In the second hour of the film, Joan, Caitlin and various health professionals chronologically outline Bishop\u2019s downward spiral after she began to refuse pharmaceutical treatment, which eventually led to her own death. She lost her job, custody of her child, became homeless, was discharged from a psychiatric institute, and yet because of the laws in place to protect Bishop\u2019s privacy, her family were never notified of her discharge. It\u2019s astounding that this lack of legal protection for people who do not possess the wherewithal to determine what is in their best interest is coded in law, and the film does begin to explore this subject. Surely, Bishop is not the only case. But because the Widers are intent on telling Bishop\u2019s story and only her story, we get a padded hour of beautiful cinematography and banal journal entries as an attempt to understand a tragic life. The effort is noble, to give Bishop a chance to tell her story, however compromised its framing and end product might be, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions. It\u2019s remarkable that a sad woman\u2019s tale could be narrativized on film, instead of becoming just another mental health statistic, but a good documentary explores the issues it explains in more detail, and offers an invitation to the viewer to learn more. \u201cGod Knows Where I Am\u201d leaves only a trace behind of a dead woman\u2019s soul. It\u2019s not enough to flesh out a nearly two-hour-long documentary, and it\u2019s not enough information to keep a viewer interested, no matter how closely they may relate to the subject matter."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Escape Plan", "Review": "If personality were enough to carry a movie, \"Escape Plan\" would never touch the ground. In this film, action movie old dogs Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger are relentlessly likeable, even when serving up plot and dialogue that would have been trampled on the writer's room floor of \"Knight Rider\" circa 1985. Swedish genre director Mikael Hafstrom's delight at having life-sized Rambo and Terminator action figures to play with is palpable in this prison break flick. He covers their hushed conversations inside The Tomb, a seemingly inescapable prison fortress, in giant, lingering close-ups. We are not to miss a single flicker of chemistry that passes between these two longstanding human franchises. Advertisement Alright, the plot. Something about how Stallone's character, Ray Breslin, is the world's leading prison escape artist, hired to show correctional facilities their security weaknesses by breaking out of them. As negotiated by his boss (Vincent D'Onofrio), his latest assignment is to escape from what used to be called a \"black site,\" an uncharted holding facility for criminals no government cares to bring to traditional justice. The Tomb is a place for the \"disappeared\" among terrorists, warlords and high-level gangsters. The Tomb is also one of those profiteering private enterprises, like Blackwater (which is mentioned as a source for its security personnel),which thrives on doing dirty work for the powerful. The script's provocative political sentiment is that nations are irrelevant; bureaucracies like the CIA and the Bureau of Prisons exist only to front deals between what Noam Chomsky would call \"unaccountable private tyrannies.\" Hobbs (Jim Caviezel), an immaculate, soft-spoken sophisticate (who would have been played by Anthony Perkins in another era), runs the show when he's not tending to his gorgeous butterfly collection. Yeah, it's a mishmash of good, strange ideas and generic nonsense, barely held together by Sly and Arnie. Here are the odd glories: 5. Character actor Vinnie Jones spoofing his numerous meathead/henchman roles, cycling between two expressions: indignation and sadistic glee.  4. A mini-\"Grand Illusion\" brotherhood plot thread involving Schwarzenegger's alliance with a Muslim prisoner who ultimately goes out in a heroic blaze of glory, in the name of Allah,\u00a0in an American action film!  3. The way Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson, as Sly's \"techno-thug\" assistant, shouts, \"That CIA bitch!\" Advertisement 2. The possibility that Caviezel, whose spectral presence gave \"The Thin Red Line\" its soul and has always seemed more suited to play Pasolini's Christ than Mel Gibson's, is pretending he's in a mid-60's European art film.  1. Arnold's generally impish portrayal of the coolest OG in prison. To create a diversion for Sly to go skulking about the joint, Arnold rages inside his solitary 'hot box\" cell, delivering aderanged monologue about evil and reciting the Lord's Prayer, all in mellifluous German. This spectacular performance within a performance suggests that Arnold could have taken over where Klaus Kinski left off.  That's about it. The rest is something you've seen lots of, if you were an action fan in the 1980's and '90s with a functioning VCR or cable box. The fight scenes are standard wrestling matches punctuated by impalements or broken necks. The gun battles are without style or suspense. Inconsistencies in plot, character and physics are sewn up with quick cuts and the same techno-thriller musical score that has accompanied every action film for the past 15 years.  Like the \"Expendables\" movies, \"Escape Plan\" squanders its opportunities for genuine nostalgia because, I suspect, its stars don't want to be remembered fondly for their old hits more than they want to show that they still got it, right here, right now.  They have no idea that we'd enjoy them bald, fat, winded after running up a short flight of stairs, playing with their grandchildren. We'd love to see these superheroes cop to age and vulnerability, to something more devastating than Vinnie Jones' right hook."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "The Hollow Point", "Review": "\u201cMillions of store-bought bullets are now being smuggled into Mexico,\u201d an on-screen title, one of several, explains at the beginning of this action thriller. \u201cThe Hollow Point\u201d looks into some dead-end lives in the Western United States, lives turned inside-out by greed, the promise of big money for a transaction that, seen from a particular angle, can look attractively dangerous.  Believe it or not, and I don\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t believe it but I feel bad for you if you spend money to find out, I\u2019m already making this movie sound way more attractive and engrossing than it actually is. Its competent lensing of various sun-baked locales notwithstanding\u2014the movie is set in Los Reyes County, Arizona, but was shot in and around Utah\u2019s deserts\u2014\u201cThe Hollow Point\u201d is such a shameless and indifferent recycling of Nihilistic Crime In The New American West clich\u00e9s that it feels like it was crafted by committee. A really lazy committee. Advertisement Directed by Gonzalo L\u00f3pez-Gallego from a script by Nils Lyew, \u201cThe Hollow Point\u201d opens, after the smuggling-ammo texts, with a standard \u201cwhere\u2019s my money\u201d standoff at a garage in the middle of arid, dusty nowhere, complete with familiar threats such as \u201cIf Clive isn\u2019t here in fifteen minutes, soon enough, I\u2019ll be talking to a dead man.\u201d While real-life criminals are not known for speaking in sentences meant to trigger suspense, it\u2019s also a fallacy to say that a crime thriller in which criminals speak realistically just wouldn\u2019t work; one need only read the early work of the crime writer George V. Higgins to understand that. But it\u2019s easier to recycle genre clich\u00e9s, and Patrick Wilson and Ian McShane are among the good actors called upon to spout them. Wilson plays a new-sheriff-in-town, a veteran cop whose continued existence on the planet seems to be a subject of wonder to many in his community, including his on-again off-again girlfriend Marla (Lynn Collins). Wilson\u2019s Wallace is joining up with McShane\u2019s Leland, an even more veteran veteran who\u2019s used to doing things his own way. The whole county, it seems, has its hand dirty in some way, and the trade in hollow-point bullets is making hands a lot dirtier. \u201cThey call them cop killers,\u201d one character says of the ordnance. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cOn account of killing cops.\u201d  To get back to hands, early in the movie Wallace loses one\u2014sliced clean off by a machete wielded by John Leguizamo, who\u2019s still in fighting trim but maybe is getting a little old for these machete-wielding-badass roles. Turns out, of course, that Leguizamo\u2019s character is a man in uniform as well. Completing the circle of morally compromised types is Jim Belushi as\u00a0 a crooked used-car dealer and Karli Hall as a sort of muse to Leguizamo\u2019s character, who posits himself as a kind of avenging angel.  These figures go through the usual grisly paces, betraying each other with unusual persistent regularity for a relatively short film. The movie shows willful ignorance of the immediate consequences of having your hand instantaneously sliced off in an area where there\u2019s no immediate medical care available, that is, you\u2019d likely die of shock rather than stagger to your partner\u2019s house and sit at its side applying pressure to the wound until sunup. But whatever. The dialogue continues in its initial vein: \u201cWhat is comin\u2019 ain\u2019t no butcher. It\u2019s punishment. You can\u2019t stop that,\u201d goes one scene featuring David Stevens, who by the evidence here would like to make a name for himself as the poor man\u2019s Walton Goggins. Pro-forma shots include the low wide-angle shot of a freshly painted frame house against a bright blue sky, and a telegraphed rack focus during an ostensibly crucial \u201cyou\u2019re the guy\u201d moment. There\u2019s literally nothing in this movie that feels like it arose from an impulse to either entertain or create art. You can almost hear the execs in a boardroom making their calculations: take one thriller storyline in the \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d mode, shoot in Utah, add one cult actor with a rep familiar to viewers of a particular \u201cgritty\u201d TV Western and put him in a similar role, add one competent but not overly costly leading man, bring the picture in for less than X number of dollars and voila, here is a genre picture that will likely yield a not stratospheric but perhaps not insubstantial return on investment. The cynicism, which the actual filmmakers have to try to rise above (and which in this case they fail to do) is almost blood-curdling.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "In a Better World", "Review": "A book by a Cambridge University scholar suggests that a lack of empathy is at the root of all cruelty. People are not intrinsically evil, argues Simon Baron-Cohen, but some lack the ability to identify with what others are feeling: \"People who lack empathy see others as mere objects.\" Although I doubt Susanne Bier knew of this book when she made \"In a Better World,\" it plays like a demonstration of the same insight. In parallel stories set in Denmark and Africa, it considers characters who act with cruelty and those who deliberately seek to act with empathy, and poses some moral choices for those who fall somewhere on the middle of the spectrum.  Advertisement \"In a Better World,\" which won this year's Academy Award for best foreign film, centers on two boys and their fathers. Elias (Markus Rygaard) and Christian (William Johnk Nielsen) meet at the school where Christian has just transferred. Elias is a cute kid with braces, and when he's picked on by the school bully, Christian defends him in a sudden and bloody way. \"Nobody will pick on me again,\" he explains. Now pull back a step to their fathers. Elias' dad is Anton (Mikael Persbrandt), who commutes between Denmark and an unnamed African country where he operates a free medical clinic. To his care come victims of all sorts, including women savagely sliced by the powerful local Big Man (Evans Muthini). Christian's dad is Claus (Ulrich Thomsen), whose wife has died of cancer and left Christian resenting his father. Anton is often in Africa, and Claus is often in London. The two boys bond. One day when Anton is home, he and Elias see a foul-tempered local man named Lars (Kim Bodnia) pushing around people who innocently offended him. Anton steps in, and Lars slaps him. Thinking this over, Anton decides to set an example to his son, and takes him to Lars' auto shop for what is intended as a nonviolent confrontation. Lars is incapable of such a thing. Christian, very inward, very intense, earlier defended Elias against the schoolyard bully and now devises a plan for them to gain revenge against Lars. Meanwhile, back in Africa, Anton's clinic receives an emergency patient: Big Man, with an ugly, festering leg wound. No more about the plot. What Susanne Bier does is cut between all of these stories to contrast the kinds of people who are instinctively cruel and those who are instinctively kind. The outcomes of the parallel stories are unpredictable although they follow a certain logic.  I admired Bier's \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" and her Danish and American versions of \"Brothers,\" but here her method is too foregrounded. The African events in particular don't fit organically into the rest of the film, playing more like a contrived contrast. The story of the boys works well (they're both good actors), and their fathers are well-drawn and seen with sympathy. There's also an estranged mother who is drawn into the unhappiness. There are two strong stories here, in Africa and Denmark. Either could have made a film. Intercut in this way, they seem too much like self-conscious parables. No doubt the film's noble intentions appealed to the academy voters, but this seems to me the weakest of this year's five nominees. What does the title suggest? That in a better world there would not be such cruelty? True, no doubt. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Pete's Dragon", "Review": "There was something about \"Pete's Dragon,\" a quality I couldn't identify at first, something that made it feel different from almost every other big summer movie, and its presence was so subtle that it took a while to figure out what it was: silence.  The silence of the forest. \"Pete's Dragon\" is David Lowery's remake of the 1977 Walt Disney animated musical about a boy and his best friend: a dragon who can turn invisible. It is the second gentlest kids' film of this summer, after Steven Spielberg's \"The BFG.\"\u2014another film pitched at kids aged seven to ten (and adults who can still remember what it felt like to be that age), but one that failed at the box office, even though it touched some of the same emotional chords as Spielberg's masterpiece, \"E.T.\" Lowery's film owes quite a bit to Spielberg generally, and \"E.T\" in particular (the dragon is named Elliott, the name of the hero of \"E.T.\"; there's a Keys-type adult character who's on the side of the kids, and the more brash and excited parts of Daniel Hart's score channel John Williams). There are nods to Spielberg-inflected movies as well, including \"The Iron Giant\" (another boy-and-his-creature flick, set in the forest primeval). But it might ultimately have more in common with movies by Terrence Malick, a Transcendental hippie Christian poet who isn't afraid to put the plot on hold and wander around with a camera, letting us experience a rarefied vision of the natural world. The whirring insects, the owls hooting in the treetops.  Advertisement Lowery, who brought the Malick in \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints,\" is in that mode again with \"Pete's Dragon,\" though he tends to pull back from anything that might be accused of being too arty. The forest and its animals feel present, physical, in ways that you rarely experience in this post-analog era of movie-making. You hear birds chirp, streams running, wind creaking the boughs of trees. You get nice, long looks at faces, treetops and sunsets. And you appreciate the distinctive noises the dragon makes when he's re-positioning his scaly-furry belly on the forest floor, or unfurling his wings like a schooner's sails. They don't sound like cartoony monster noises. They're like a child's memory of a beloved dog that was really big, or seemed big because they were so little. Elliott is a magical creature, but more than that, he's a very large animal, smart and full of feeling. He doesn't move like so many CGI-rendered beasts in contemporary film. He moves like a medium-sized dragon would move if he actually existed, like the dinosaurs in the \"Jurassic Park\" films. And when he looks Pete in the eye, you sense a personality there. A consciousness. (This is a Top Five dragon movie, by the way\u2014though my inner child insists that the \"Dragonslayer\" dragon is still the best.) The plot? Oh, right. There isn't much, and maybe it's a good thing that there isn't more, because the film runs an hour and 42 minutes and feels just a bit longer, like a goodhearted bedtime story that outlasts the kids it's meant to enthrall. Young Pete (Levi Alexander) is in the backseat of a car during a family vacation to the Pacific Northwest, reading his favorite book, \"Elliott Gets Lost\"; his parents swerve to avoid hitting a deer and die in an accident. When wolves menace the terrified child, Elliott appears like a guardian angel, saves him, and parents him. The kid is feral,\u00a0 rough around the edges, but he's sweet and considerate, because he had a good role model.  Then comes a stretch that plays like desert island sequence of \"The Black Stallion\" where the only two characters are a boy and his horse. It's five years later, though perhaps not in the present; the movie is vague about its time frame, but the lack of modern tech suggests it's set before the '90s. Pete and Elliott are getting along like missing characters from \"The Jungle Book.\" They play together in ways that seem audacious and reckless to anyone who didn't grow up in the woods with a dragon as caregiver. In one memorable image, showcased in the trailer, the boy leaps off a cliff and the dragon sails upward to catch him; you can tell by their nonchalance that it's not the first time they've done this.  Advertisement An old timer in town, Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford), is known as the only living person who's seen the dragon. The beast has a local mythology, like Bigfoot or the Yeti or the Jersey Devil, but it's kept alive mainly by Meacham's stories. His daughter Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) hasn't seen it, nor has her fiance Jack (Wes Bentley), a logger, or his daughter Natalie (Oona Lawrence). When Grace finds Pete living in a self-built shack in the woods and takes him to the hospital for treatment, the film enters Frankenstein-and-the-villagers mode. Will Elliott save Pete from civilization? Will Pete save Elliott from being captured and put on display like a freak of nature, or worse, death by posse? Will the dragon breathe fire? Mommy, when will the dragon breathe fire? (Don't worry, kid, they don't put a dragon in a movie and not have him breathe fire.) There isn't too much to the film beyond that, except for restrained, on-point performances (by Redford and Howard especially), and this feels like such a deliberate choice, such a willful disregarding of current commercial formula, that you might feel elated by the lightness and innocence on display. This is one of those medium-sized (or medium-sized seeming) movies with a big heart and lots of family appeal\u2014the kind of film that can make adults feel like kids without making them feel gullible or stupid, and that can entertain more attentive and patient children simply by putting a memorable world and memorable characters onscreen.  Common wisdom says Hollywood doesn't make this kind of movie anymore. But it's not true. The studios make one of them every few months, and whether they're great or merely good, they give us respite from the clanking, bashing, burning and pouting that passes for fantasy now. We've seen at least three live-action films this year in a \"Pete's Dragon\" vein: \"Midnight Special,\" \"The BFG.\" and \"The Jungle Book.\" They all deserved to be supported, but only one was. Hopefully \"Pete's Dragon\" will be another. It'd be a shame to think of this genre of movie vanishing from theaters in a haze, like Elliott turning invisible. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Winter's Bone", "Review": "The movie heroes who affect me most are not extroverted. They don't strut, speechify and lead armies. They have no superpowers. They are ordinary people who are faced with a need and rise to the occasion. Ree Dolly is such a hero. A girl of 17, she acts as the homemaker for her younger brother and sister. This is in the backlands of the Ozarks. Her mother sits useless all day, mentally absent. Her father, who was jailed for cooking meth, is missing. She tries to raise the kids and feed them, scraping along on welfare and the kindness of neighbors. The children, like all children who are not beaten, are cheerful and energetic, and love to play. They have not learned they are disadvantaged. Advertisement This world is established with bleak economy in the opening scenes of Debra Granik's \u201cWinter's Bone,\u201d which was a double prize winner at Sundance 2010. Unmistakably filmed on location, this film focuses on a society that has been left behind. It looks like Walker Evans' photographs of the rural Depression, brought forward to today. The unanswered question is how Ree Dolly grew up in this world and became strong, self-reliant and proud. She didn't learn it from her parents. The sheriff comes to call. Her father Jessup has skipped bail. To meet his bond, he put up the house \u2014 perhaps the only asset he had. If he doesn't turn himself in within a week, the family will be thrown out. Just like that. \u201cI'll find him,\u201d Ree says quietly and firmly. And that's what she sets out to do.  Ree is played by Jennifer Lawrence, a 19-year-old newcomer who has already starred in Jodie Foster's next film. Lawrence embodies a fierce, still center that is the source of her heroism. She makes no boasts, issues no threats, depends on a dogged faith that people will do the right thing \u2014 even when no one we meet seems to deserve that faith. \"Don't ask for what ought to be offered,\" she tells her little brother, although the lives of her parents seem to be an exercise in asking and not offering. Did she raise herself? Everyone in the district knew that Jessup cooked methamphetamine. He is a modern moonshiner. What's obvious is that meth doesn't seem to have made him much money. Perhaps its illegality is its appeal, and its market is among people he feels comfortable with. Ree's travels in search of her father lead her to his brother, Teardrop (John Hawkes), whose existence inflicts a wound on the gift of being alive. The script, by Granik and Anne Rosellini, based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, uses the ancient form of an odyssey. At its end will be Ree's father, dead or alive. Most likely dead, she begins to conclude, but unless there is a body, her family will be homeless and torn apart. She treks through a landscape scarcely less ruined than the one in Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road.\" This land seems post-catastrophe. Although it has cars and electricity, running shoes and kitchens, cigarettes and televisions, these seem like relics of an earlier, prosperous time. If thrown-away possessions pile up around the houses of people, it is because they've reached the end of the line. There is no next stop. Advertisement There is a hazard of caricature here. Granik avoids it. Her film doesn't live above these people, but among them. Ree herself has lived as one of them and doesn't see them as inferior, only ungiving and disappointing. In her father's world, everyone is a criminal, depends on a criminal or sells to criminals. That they are engaging in illegal activities makes them vulnerable to informers and plea-bargainers, so they are understandably suspicious. The cliche would be that they suspect outsiders. These characters suspect insiders, even family members. As Ree's journey takes her to one character after another, Granik is able to focus on each one's humanity, usually damaged. They aren't attractions in a sideshow, but survivors in a shared reality. Do they look at Ree and see a girl in need and a family threatened with eviction? I think they see the danger of their own need and eviction; it's safer to keep quiet and close off. So the film rests on Ree, counter-balanced by Teardrop, who is aggressive with his hatefulness instead of passive in amorality. A story like this could become mired in despair, but Ree's hope and courage lock us in. How did she get to be the way she is? We are born optimistic, although life can be a great discouragement. In every bad situation, there are usually a few good people."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Strangers: Prey at Night", "Review": "Ten years is a long gap between a movie and its sequel, especially for a horror movie. That gap, though, seems as if it was enough time for the filmmakers of \"The Strangers: Prey at Night\" to get it right. The 2008 original, written and directed by Bryan Bertino, never quite had the courage of its convictions until its bleak-beyond-bleak ending. The problem, though, was that the ending came out of nowhere. Here was another home-invasion movie, in which it seemed as if the villains were simply pranking a couple for an extended period of time (one of the victims of the invasion was the only one to kill anyone until the climax). When the masked antagonists revealed their true natures in the final minutes, it came across as a shock in the worst possible way.    Advertisement In theory, the ending was chilling\u2014the idea that this trio of people didn't have any rational motive, any supernatural characteristics, or, when the time came, any scruples in killing their victims. In practice, it felt cheap\u2014tacking on a hopeless ending just to make us feel bad.    Bertino returns, as a co-screenwriter this time, leaving the directorial work to Johannes Roberts, who brings a far surer hand and a more striking visual aesthetic to the sequel. So much of the success of any given horror film relies on a few aesthetic elements: its atmosphere, its ability to play with light and the shadow, and, of course, location (...location, location\u2014as real estate folks would add for effect). From the start, a prologue that breaks its predecessor's strange sense that the killers might just be toying with their victims, this is a visually oppressive exercise in terror. Save for a few scenes in a brightly sunlit suburb, the film remains that way for the extent of its running time.    Thanks to the original, we know by now that the three strangers (played by Damian Maffei, Emma Bellomy, and Lea Enslin), who wear ironic masks or a hood with painted smiles, mean business. The neat thing about this sequel is that it stands on its own. We don't need to know from the ending of the original movie that these people are heartless, cold-blooded killers. They get to work almost immediately in this outing, pulling up to an occupied trailer home in an otherwise empty trailer park in their beat-up pickup truck\u2014a peppy pop tune blaring on the radio (Roberts has that song play over the production logos and a black screen, but as soon as the film proper starts, it cuts out with a jolt, as we take in the dim, streetlight-lit scene). As with the original, a few knocks on a door at an ungodly hour of the night starts off a brief, if genuinely creepy, opening.    The rest of the story follows a likable family of four: father Mike (Martin Henderson), mother Cindy (Christina Hendricks), daughter Kinsey (Bailee Madison), and son Luke (Lewis Pullman). They're on their way to that trailer park for a weekend trip, before taking Kinsey to a boarding school. There's tension between the family members, naturally. The parents are worried about their daughter in slightly different ways: Mike is a bit out of the loop but knows something is amiss, and Cindy was in a similar place during her own teenage years. Kinsey resents her parents' decision, as well as her brother's standing as the \"perfect\" child. Luke clearly thinks his younger sister is a nuisance, but he wishes for a return to the days when Kinsey was his little sister.    Advertisement It's a little surprising how well Bertino and fellow screenwriter Ben Ketai fit in scenes to help flesh out these relationships before the terror truly begins, and, even more surprisingly, during the height of it. (The height of the terror, by the way, is a near constant once it starts). The film doesn't stop for these moments. They're built into the rising tension, as the family separates and slowly comes to realize that they aren't alone in the park, and they raise the impact of what could have been straightforward sequences of the killers hunting down the assorted family members, trapping them in enclosed spaces, and getting to their bloody work. Two stand out: an intense scene of last-second escape in a cramped bathroom and a parent offering a child what might be some final words. Even more vital to the film as a thriller, we have a sense that, unlike the protagonists in the original, these characters have an actual chance against the killers.    All of this heightens the uneasiness, because we like these characters enough in their own, unique ways. They're good enough that we haven't even arrived at Roberts' technique yet. It's impressive on a technical level, with the director and cinematographer Ryan Samul utilizing some lengthy, preternaturally precise zooms (a shot that starts dozens of feet away gets into almost-close-up while still keeping an actor in frame).    It's even more effective in how well Roberts incorporates the seemingly vast expanse of this location for a series of genuinely scary sequences. The trailers are tight spaces, where any of the killers could be hiding in the shadows or beneath some kind of cover. One will instantly notice the absence of the usual build-up and sting cues on the soundtrack, meaning that we're never quite certain when the scare will arrive. The fields of the park provide enough sporadic light and distance that we can barely spot a figure or the headlights of that damned truck standing\u2014and then approaching\u2014from afar. There's a virtuoso sequence at a pool that opens with a subversion of Roberts and Samul's usually slow zooms. The sequence just keeps going from there, as one of the characters engages in a life-or-death fight with an ax-wielding maniac on the edge of and in the water.    \"The Strangers: Prey at Night\" is an unexpected anomaly\u2014a sequel that both is better than and fixes the problems of its predecessor. It's a chilling and genuinely frightening horror film, driven by some solid performances and Roberts' command of atmosphere, location, and relentless pacing."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Solace", "Review": "The serial killer movie, perhaps now finally unable to compete with superhero franchises and bleak reality, has been circling the cultural drain for some time. As it refuses to go down and stay down, it shows itself in some unusual and unusually desperate-looking shapes. \u201cSolace,\u201d starring Anthony Hopkins, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Abbie Cornish, directed by Afonso Poyart, is an ostentatiously busy mish-mash of thriller tropes and clich\u00e9s, enlivened (or so it might believe) by fancy CGI-enabled visual overstuffing.  Advertisement The movie opens with Morgan and Cornish, as FBI agents Joe Merriweather and Katherine Cowles, investigating a peculiar murder. The victim sits, eyes opened in a perfectly poised position, killed by a supposedly pain-free spiking to the medulla oblongata. This is, we later learn, the third such killing. But oddly enough, the victims have little to connect them in terms of class, race, or age\u2014one of them was a little boy, as it happens. \u201cI need to go see him,\u201d Merriweather tells Cowles as they leave the crime scene and stand in the Significant Weather that this movie\u2019s always throwing at us. If it rains as much in this Georgia-set movie as it did in \u201cSeven,\u201d there\u2019s a reason for that: this movie\u2019s script, here credited to Ted Griffin and Sean Bailey, originated as a kind of sequel to \u201cSeven.\u201d  But never mind that, who\u2019s \u201chim?\u201d He is John Clancy, a one-time colleague of Merriweather\u2019s who now, after personal tragedy, lives as a recluse in a barely furnished house in a remote rural area. John is played by Anthony Hopkins, and he\u2019s a psychic. The kind that sees things \u2026 too many things \u2026 and he sees them when he touches a person. Hence, on putting his hand on Cowles\u2019 shoulder, the viewer gets a flash-frame of Abbie Cornish with red blood seeming to flood from a spot above her forehead. Something bad\u2019s going to happen to her. Something bad\u2019s going to happen to Merriweather too. Later on we learn that Clancy doesn\u2019t just see the future, he sees a multiplicity of futures. This is where the visual overstuffing comes in; many scenes show a particular character multiplied into tens of selves, going different ways within different settings. I\u2019m making it sound \u201cneat,\u201d but it actually plays as \u201cpossibly exhausting, in the event that you were interested, only because all the characters are so rote, you\u2019re not.\u201d Hopkins, who is also an executive producer on the movie, doesn\u2019t exactly phone in his performance. But since Clancy is genius-level brilliant, like Hannibal Lecter, and has great stores of compassion like Doctor Frederick Treves, and is also world-weary and consumed by confused grief, like Henry Wilcox, Hopkins is treading familiar ground here. Only it\u2019s with a character who\u2019s not nearly even close to being as well-written as the three I just mentioned (he played Lecter in films I need not mention, Treves in \u201cThe Elephant Man,\u201d and Wilcox in \u201cHowards End\u201d).  Advertisement The movie shuttles near-breathlessly from killing to killing, adding note from, obviously, \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d and also \u201cThe Usual Suspects.\u201d The visions Clancy has form the pieces of a puzzle that we know we will be handed the solution to by the movie\u2019s end, even as the film lets us know that some of the terrible events we see can be prevented. The twists will be in how they\u2019re prevented.  It eventually emerges that the killings do have a connective thread: all the victims are suffering from fatal diseases they don\u2019t even necessarily know that they have yet. I would say this is where the movie makes its fatal turn into ridiculousness, but my own psychic abilities told me this picture was parked in an aesthetic doom spot right off the bat. In any event, one thing this means is that the killer himself has the same powers that Clancy has\u2014but even more highly developed. Which makes Clancy bolt from the case, temporarily. What did I say before about superhero movies? \u201cSolace,\u201d which also ends up being derivative of a Jack Kevorkian biopic, does a lot of huffing and puffing with respect to debating euthanasia, but in its ultimate heart of hearts it\u2019s a loud superhero movie: \u201cWar of the Psychics.\u201d And so it serves up its array of loud and pointless surprises, and it also serves up Colin Farrell in a crucial role that I won\u2019t \u201cspoil.\u201d Farrell, too, doesn\u2019t exactly phone it in, but he does seem a little ridiculous trying to bring coiled intensity to a spectacularly one-dimensional role. If \u201cSolace\u201d represents the sort of personal-revenue generating gigs that Mr. Farrell takes so as to free him up to work with more \u201cartistically ambitious\u201d directors such as Yorgos Lanthimos (of the dreaded \u201cThe Lobster\u201d fame), I\u2019d have to say his career is languishing in an unusual lose-lose proposition at the moment.  The directorial pyrotechnics keep \u201cSolace\u201d from \u201cdragging\u201d in a narrative sense; the very real boredom it nonetheless elicits is more existential."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Salvation", "Review": "A Danish revenge Western starring Mads Mikkelsen, huh? If\r\nthe credited director were Nicholas Winding Refn, the idea could pass for a\r\n\u201cFunny or Die\u201d pastiche. A little bit inside, admittedly\u2014one needs to be a real\r\nup-to-the-minute cinephile to get the joke, but it\u2019s pretty\u2026evocative. But as\r\nit happens, \u201cThe Salvation,\u201d a Danish revenge Western starring Mads Mikkelsen,\r\nis a very real movie, and it is directed by Kristian Levring (\u201cThe King Is\r\nAlive\u201d), whose sensibility is a little more nuanced than that of the\r\nsensationalist Refn, which is all to this movie\u2019s benefit.  Advertisement Viewers who only know Mad Mikkelsen as the title character\r\nin the ultra-creepy NBC series \u201cHannibal,\u201d or recollect his teardrops-of-blood\r\nturn as Le Chiffre in the Bond reboot \u201cCasino Royale\u201d may have trouble\r\nimagining him in a role as anything other than a stolid terror. His broad\r\nshoulders, often stiff bearing, and finely sculpted but almost over-definite\r\nfacial features\u2014broad brow, skyscraper-high cheekbones, a mouth like a closed\r\nswitchblade\u2014don\u2019t fit the profile of the devoted husband and family man that\r\nMikkelsen plays at the opening of this movie, which takes place in the American\r\nWest of the 1870s. The thing is, of course, that Mikkelsen\u2019s a damn fine actor,\r\nand as Jon, a Dane come to America to escape the aftermath of a war in his home\r\ncountry, meeting his young son and reunited with his wife after seven years\r\napart, he brings a lot of heart to the train station meeting with which this\r\nfilm opens, complete with gorgeous rock-formation vistas and stirring\r\nMorricone-like music on the soundtrack.  However. Mikkelsen does not get to play the kind, devoted\r\nhusband and father for too long. Soon both wife and son are, well, dead, and\r\nJon has taken swift revenge on the dirty rapists and killers responsible. It\u2019s\r\nat this point that a viewer might be truly grateful that the movie wasn\u2019t\r\ndirected by Refn, for fear that Refn might depict Jon, I dunno, bathing in the\r\nentrails of the men who destroyed his family. No, Jon merely shoots them, and\r\nthe violence is brutal, and fittingly so, but it is not carried out to\r\ncartoonish extremes. Since this is not just a Western but a homage to Westerns\r\n(one wonders whether it\u2019s possible in this day and age to make a Western that\u2019s\r\nnot), and since all he described action takes place in the first fifteen\r\nminutes of a 90-minute movie, that of course can\u2019t be the end of it, and as it\r\nhappens, and should surprise no one, the dirty dogs that Jon killed happen to\r\nhave a fairly prominent dirty dog relative/associate. Enter Jeffrey Dean\r\nMorgan\u2019s Delarue, a gang leader and \u201cboss\u201d who\u2019s got the \u201cgood\u201d people of Jon\u2019s\r\ntown well and truly under his thumb. He vows vengeance on the killer of his\r\nyounger brother (for he was one of the two dispatched by Jon) not just on his\r\nbehalf but on that of his brother\u2019s widow Madelaine, a beauty with a slashed-up\r\nlip that just won\u2019t seem to heal, and whose disinclination to speak is soon\r\nrevealed as an actual inability. Delarue\u2019s a real horror show, as his adoption\r\nof Madelaine more than aptly demonstrates, and the way that the townspeople bow\r\nto his will (Jonathan Pryce\u2019s undertaker character is particularly obsequious\r\nand weasely) is both deplorable and kind of understandable.\u00a0 But summoning the steely implacability that\u2019s\r\nbecome a hallmark of his performing style, Mikkelsen transforms into a\r\nmerciless, quiet force of vengeance; working with brother Peter (Mikael\r\nPersbrandt) a somewhat more voluble and crafty character (the way he manages\r\nhis escape from jail is one of the film\u2019s standout scenes), he makes the\r\nevildoers pay, even as the audience is made to keep guessing as to whose side\r\nthe silent Madelaine, a key game piece, is on.  It\u2019s all quite engaging, beautifully shot and staged, with\r\nvery satisfyingly choreographed action scenes. It is not a particularly\r\nlight-hearted Western but it\u2019s also neither portentous nor pretentious, and it\r\ndoesn\u2019t wear out its welcome. Some of the CGI-enhanced shots of evocative\r\nWestern landscapes are a little TOO evocative, that is, picture-perfect, but\r\nwhat are you going to do.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Rebel in the Rye", "Review": "Holden Caulfield hated phonies. He detested the superficial fantasies offered by Hollywood yet still yearned for the lost innocence of his youth. As the beloved teenage protagonist of J.D. Salinger\u2019s 1951 literary masterpiece, The Catcher in the Rye, Caulfield has always upstaged the enigmatic author who brought him to life. Danny Strong\u2019s \u201cRebel in the Rye\u201d attempts to correct that by placing Salinger at the center of his own biopic, while utilizing Kenneth Slawenski\u2019s 2010 biography, J.D. Salinger: A Life, as its chief source material.\u00a0 Advertisement This sounds like a promising approach at the outset, but the execution is riddled with problems, not the least of which is the absence of Salinger\u2019s actual work. We get fragmented excerpts of his text along with some wordless homages (such as the novel\u2019s iconic carousel), but no real sense of his genius. Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cPaterson\u201d masterfully demonstrated how the essence of William Carlos Williams\u2019 poetry could be captured cinematically, immersing us in the rhythm and tone of his text. Strong\u2019s film is less interested in what Salinger did than in what led him to do what he did. It assumes the audience has already read Catcher in the Rye, and on that level, it\u2019s a missed opportunity.\u00a0 As a character study, the picture is efficiently made and never less than watchable, but it lacks the urgency and inspiration of Strong\u2019s best work. His two great scripts for Jay Roach\u2019s HBO films, 2008\u2019s \u201cRecount\u201d and 2012\u2019s \u201cGame Change,\u201d take place over much narrower time spans and delve into the minutia of well-documented events in political history. As revealing a profile as Slawenski\u2019s book may have been, it still left countless facets of Salinger\u2019s life shrouded in mystery. Just as the majority of his writing has been kept from the public eye, most of the author\u2019s years were spent in the isolation of his New Hampshire cabin. So many details are missing from this narrative that it feels more like a series of biographical beats mixed with theories than a fully fleshed-out portrait. Nicholas Hoult is a gifted actor more than capable of illuminating the insecurities and fixations of his character, but he's never quite believable as Salinger. He resembles the youthful, chiseled vision that the author likely had of himself when he stubbornly insisted that only he should be allowed to play Caulfield. Yet Hoult can only do so much with a script that leaves his key motivations frustratingly muddled. His finest moment occurs toward the end, after bidding adieu to an old friend. As he watches the man walk away, Hoult opens his mouth as if to holler out to him, before abruptly turning and exiting the frame. That fleeting nuance suggests Salinger\u2019s desire to have said more, and one wishes the film had said more too.\u00a0 Advertisement The friend in this scene is Story magazine editor Whit Burnett, Salinger\u2019s former writing teacher as well as the first person to publish the author\u2019s work. Hoult\u2019s lingering glance at Burnett poignantly affirms that this man was as close to a father figure as any Salinger ever encountered, certainly much more so than his maddeningly aloof old man. If \u201cRebel in the Rye\u201d has any advantage over Roach\u2019s equally flawed Oscar bait, \u201cTrumbo,\u201d it\u2019s the pitch-perfect casting of its ensemble headlined by Kevin Spacey as Burnett. For the second time this year, the actor has injected a weirdly paternal warmth into an initially formidable authority figure.\u00a0 As the crime boss in Edgar Wright\u2019s \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d Spacey transformed gobs of exposition into a sardonic symphony, while guarding the young hero in ways both frightening and touching. I couldn\u2019t help being reminded of the teacher Spacey played in Mimi Leder\u2019s much-maligned yet often well-acted 2000 tearjerker, \u201cPay it Forward\u201d during Burnett\u2019s early scenes, as he simultaneously charms and challenges his students into transcending their own expectations. He believes that an author\u2019s voice is the extension of their ego, and that a story falls apart when that voice fails to incorporate a strong narrative. The irony of this script is in how its narrative fails to incorporate Salinger\u2019s own voice, no matter how many quotes it borrows from him. How much more powerful would the post-WWII scenes have been had they explored the specific ways in which Salinger\u2019s war service formed the themes of his novel, much like how Laurent Bouzereau\u2019s riveting Netflix documentary, \u201cFive Came Back,\u201d illustrated the impact of war on directors such as Frank Capra and William Wyler? Caulfield\u2019s allergy to phoniness achieves new depths of meaning in light of Salinger\u2019s disillusioning return to the states, where he was informed that his PTSD was just a phase. It also helps explain why Salinger balked at the notion of artistic compromise, even if it resulted in his work remaining unpublished. Better to leave his writing honest and in a drawer than sanitized and read by the masses. There are several individual scenes here that are effective on their own, but they are surrounded by far too many others in which Salinger meets with a revolving door of mentors. For an alleged rebel, he sure seems willing to obey the advice of Burnett, not to mention that of his spiritual guru, Swami Nihilananda (Bernard White), and his literary agent, Dorothy Olding (Sarah Paulson, making the most of her brief screen time).\u00a0 Advertisement Burnett tells Salinger to turns Caulfield\u2019s story into a novel, and he does. Nihilananda tells Salinger to remove the distraction of the city from his life, and he does. Olding approves of Salinger\u2019s dream to write for himself rather than for his rabid fans, and the rest is history. Each of these motives are spelled out in all-too-tidy a fashion, while the more intriguing material is overlooked. We meet the high school student whose betrayal of the author is routinely blamed for his subsequent seclusion, but we never get to see what a Salinger-led youth group looks like. Also missing is a satisfactory reason for why he cruelly shut Burnett out of his life for so many years, other than pure pigheadedness. This is a glaring omission since Spacey and Hoult\u2019s scenes together form the heart of the picture, especially when contrasted with any scene pairing Salinger with one of his lovers. After receiving a lackluster reception at Sundance, Strong recut the film for its theatrical release, and though I didn\u2019t view the previous cut, this one appears to be comprised of half-realized highlights from a television miniseries. Consider the grand entrance of Oona O\u2019Neill, splendidly played by dead ringer Zoey Deutch. She\u2019s set up as the unattainable object of Salinger\u2019s lust, but as soon as they share a single scene together, she\u2019s cast out of the picture before we get the chance to absorb the significance of their relationship. When Salinger arrives back home after the war, his German wife (Anna Bullard) is as much a surprise to his family as she is to the audience (whereas Deutch got one big scene, Bullard only gets one line).\u00a0 As Salinger\u2019s second wife, Lucy Boynton has a nice introductory scene where she delights Salinger with a frank put-down of his work, but it isn\u2019t long before the infatuation fades and she turns into just another face for him to ignore. At least she gets one good line in response to her husband\u2019s ill treatment of Burnett: \u201cWith all that meditation, you\u2019d think you would\u2019ve learned to forgive by now.\u201d Alas, forgiveness isn\u2019t always easy, especially if you\u2019re Joyce Maynard, one of the many young female admirers Salinger reportedly seduced for sexual favors before promptly abandoning them. Perhaps \u201cRebel in the Rye\u201d glosses over Salinger\u2019s treatment of women precisely because of these disturbing claims. After all, they certainly would render the film\u2019s stated conviction\u2014that Salinger produced work without expecting anything in return\u2014resoundingly phony.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Killing Them Safely", "Review": "Reflecting on Nick Berardini's \u201cKilling Them Safely\u201d on the night of Chicago protests for another death of a civilian due by excessive police force, the tension between civilians and law enforcement remains thoroughly despairing. Both sides, regardless of power, have a very human but potentially destructive fear. In the scenarios where a police officer may initially desire humanity, there have to be better methods for cops to properly engage civilians.\u00a0Berardini\u2019s doc vigorously proves that despite their marketing, Tasers are not the answer. They are only means to a bigger, deadlier problem.\u00a0 Advertisement In his directorial debut, Berardini sets his sights on the billion-dollar Taser company, and the men behind it (brothers Rick and Tom Smith) who repeatedly claim that they have changed the world for the better. Taser is the only company in the world that creates these conducted electrical weapons (or CEWs), as currently used by 17,000 police forces throughout the world. For their police pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, Tom and Rick Smith upgraded Jack Cover\u2019s original 1969 Taser to become something that doesn\u2019t just shock the human body, it practically stops it with 50,000 volts. When Taser\u2019s X26 took off in the early 2000s, it became a phenomenon for the company.\u00a0 But then, very human elements began to unravel the Taser's perfect facade. As detailed in Berardini's collected news reports, the Taser was revealed to be a type of police crutch, an easier option than physically detaining someone (like a six-year-old at school, or a 56-year-old in a wheelchair as in 2006). Despite its intent as a self-proclaimed, \"non-lethal\" instrument meant to snuff a disturbance, Tasers aided excessive police force to the number of 300 Taser-related deaths by 2008.\u00a0The power of \u201cKilling Them Safely\u201d is that it brings to light some of these cases that may have been swept under the rug. It heroically questions that even if the Taser doesn't always kill, why should even one unfortunate loss be acceptable? Throwing Taser\u2019s poster catchphrase back in their face, Berardini has essentially made a film to \u201cprotect the truth and convict the guilty.\u201d Though lacking personality in its indictment, \u201cKilling Them Safely\u201d is armed with vigorous detail and horrific footage of Tasers taking lives on camera, played out in full. A particularly disturbing episode involves the famous case of Robert Dzieka\u0144ski, a frustrated Polish immigrant who was tasered to death in a Canadian airport by Mounties untrained in the proper Taser use. Another involves the death of 23-year-old Stanley Bachtel, who was tasered to death after being pulled over for speeding and freaking out about how the cops were treating him. Like many others, he was shocked into a state of cardiac arrest.  Advertisement \u201cKilling Them Safely\u201d can be dry, especially when its second half turns to the medical investigations against Taser and the Smith brothers by prosecuting attorneys Peter Williamson and John Burton. The often jaw-dropping, scandalous nature of Taser's defenses is downplayed, despite the can of worms they offer to the current state of police business and even gun control (\"Tasers don't kill people, people kill people\").\u00a0By no coincidence, \u201cKilling Them Safely\u201d doesn\u2019t create compelling characters out of any of its reoccurring talking heads, despite their interactions with the Taser enterprise. Even Berardini\u2019s fervor to burn Taser to the ground with a documentarian\u2019s vengeance comes from an unknown place, an incomplete big picture created in the process.\u00a0 \u201cKilling Them Safely\u201d is valiant at damaging a Goliath business where it counts, decimating the purpose and potential of a golden product. Berardini has lots of content here to break the delusions of those who want to believe the peace behind Tasers, or not question the motives within those who hold authority. Especially for those in law enforcement, \u201cKilling Them Safely\u201d should be required viewing before taking taxpayer money to invest in their next attempt at serving and protecting their fellow man."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Love, Rosie", "Review": "\u201cLove, Rosie\u201d is one of those annoying movies in which everything would be just fine if the two central characters had a simple conversation that cleared up all their misunderstandings. But then, there would be no movie \u2013 although, in retrospect, that might not be such a bad thing. Instead, we get contrivances and coincidences, near-misses and almost-theres. This cosmic confluence of events, which takes place over a dozen years, is meant to be swoony and tragic but is actually more irritating than anything else. That the actors playing our would-be lovers\u2014Lily Collins (\u201cMirror Mirror\u201d) and Sam Claflin (the \u201cHunger Games\u201d movies)\u2014are appealing individually and have decent chemistry together helps make this thoroughly mediocre British romantic comedy more tolerable than it ought to be. Advertisement Director Christian Ditter offers some artful touches in adapting Cecelia Ahern\u2019s novel \u201cWhere Rainbows End.\u201d The lighting is often quite lovely, for example\u2014streaks of late-afternoon sunshine in a park, or lamplight filling a darkened bedroom. But for every delicate element there are many others that are heavy-handed or cringe-inducing, including some painfully on-the-nose musical selections. (Salt-N-Pepa\u2019s perky \u201cPush It\u201d plays while Collins\u2019 character, Rosie, is giving birth. Get it? Because she\u2019s pushing!) But the tonal transition that occurs before that scene\u2014from a sweet and quiet moment of Rosie bonding with her sizable bump to the noisy wackiness of her screaming through delivery\u2014is reflective of the kind of jarring shifts that often make this movie so uneven. The script from Juliette Towhidi begins in the present day, with Rosie making a speech at a wedding, then flashes back to reveal the lifelong friendship she\u2019s shared with Claflin\u2019s Alex. The two have been inseparable since they were 5 years old; then at Rosie\u2019s 18th\u00a0birthday, they briefly (and drunkenly) kissed after too many tequila shots. The spark is clearly there. But in the ensuing years, each has managed to become involved with other people who are just as clearly wrong for them. These aren\u2019t just ill-advised dalliances\u2014they\u2019re aggressively bad picks, depleting the film of even the slightest shred of tension as to its outcome. Alex has a penchant for vapid, leggy blondes. Rosie romps with her thoughtless, pretty-boy prom date and winds up pregnant after a condom mishap. And here\u2019s one of the many places where \u201cLove, Rosie\u201d takes a detour into territory that isn\u2019t just distractingly unbelievable; it\u2019s downright stupid. Rather than tell her best friend that she\u2019s expecting, Rosie keeps this information from Alex because she\u2019s afraid it will prevent him from heading to Harvard to study medicine. Or something. Boston was their shared dream (she\u2019d planned to study hotel management at Boston College\u2014although she also mentions Boston University, which is an entirely different place) but now he\u2019ll have to go alone while she secretly changes diapers. They grew up across the street from each other in an insular neighborhood; the notion that he wouldn\u2019t find out she has a baby is absurd. But whatever. We need to move on\u2014there are so many other problems here. Advertisement Years pass. Alex stays in Boston, ostensibly trying to forge a medical career, although we never actually see him studying or caring for patients. Rosie, following in her father\u2019s footsteps, takes a job as a chambermaid at a posh hotel with dreams of opening her own cozy inn someday. Jaime Winstone (Ray\u2019s daughter), as Rosie\u2019s co-worker and best friend, livens things up while dialing down the clich\u00e9s of the wisecracking sidekick. And yet: Their conversations definitely don\u2019t pass the Bechdel test. Despite the fact that she\u2019s a grown woman and a mother now, all Rosie can talk about is Alex. More years pass. Rosie and Alex visit each other across the Atlantic. They send instant messages and text. They flirt and fight and eventually make up\u2014but first, Rosie returns home, feeling gloomy, to the obvious strains of Gilbert O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s \u201cAlone Again (Naturally).\u201d Yet the cruel forces of nature conspire to keep them apart. These include the father of Rosie\u2019s now-12-year-old daughter, who returns to the picture just in time to steal an actual handwritten letter from Alex and then stuff it in a drawer to keep her from reading his confessions of love. \u201cWe just keep missing each other!\u201d Rosie laments tearfully toward the film\u2019s end. Collins and Claflin have a few moments that seem honest and effortless enough to make you wish for them to end that streak, but not nearly enough."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Arctic Tale", "Review": "\"Arctic Tale\" journeys to one of the most difficult places on earth for animals to make a living, and shows it growing even more unfriendly. The documentary studies polar bears and walruses in the Arctic, as global warming raises temperatures and changes the way they have done business since time immemorial. Much of the footage is astonishing, considering that it was obtained at frigid temperatures, sometimes underwater, and usually within attacking distance of large and dangerous mammals. We follow two emblematic characters, Nanu, a newborn polar bear cub, and Seela, a newborn walrus. The infants venture out into their new world of blinding white and merciless cold, and learn to swim or climb onto solid footing, as the case may be. They also get lessons from their parents on stalking prey, defending themselves against predators, and presumably keeping one eye open while asleep. Advertisement The animals are composites of several different individuals, created in the editing room from footage shot over a period of 10 years, but the editing is so seamless that the illusion holds up. The purpose of the film, made by a team headed by the married couple of director Sarah Robertson and cinematographer Adam Ravetch, is not to enforce scholarly accuracy but to create a fable of birth, life and death at the edge of the world. It is said that the landmark documentary \"March of the Penguins\" began life in France with a cute soundtrack on which the penguins voiced their thoughts. The magnificence of that film is explained in large part to Morgan Freeman's objective narration, which was content to describe a year in the lives of the penguins; the facts were so astonishing that no embroidery was necessary. \"Arctic Tale,\" however, chooses the opposite approach. Queen Latifah narrates a story in which the large and fearsome beasts are personalized almost like cartoon characters. And the soundtrack reinforces that impression with song: As dozens of walruses huddle together on an ice floe, for example, we hear \"We Are Family\" and mighty blasts of walrus flatulence. They might also have been singing \"we are appearing in a family film.\" The movie might be enthralling to younger viewers, and the images have undeniable power for everyone. The dilemma the movie sidesteps is that being a polar bear or a walrus is a violent undertaking. In a land without vegetation, evolution has provided animals that survive by eating each other. In one blood-curdling scene, Nanu's mother cautiously shepherds her cubs away from a male polar bear that would, yes, like to eat them. The walrus with her baby is automatically paired (it seems) with another female walrus, an \"auntie,\" who volunteers to help protect the little family. This is all the more unselfish considering what happens to the auntie. The film does not linger on scenes of killing or eating, preferring to make it clear that such events, and other tragedies, are happening not far offscreen. The eyes of little audience members are spared the gory details. But the comfy view of Arctic life, opening with those two little bear cubs romping in the snow and snuggling under mom for a snack, quickly descends into a struggle for survival. It's hard enough for them to live in such an icy world, but harder still when the ice melts. When ice grows scarce, so will polar bears and walruses, because although both species are accomplished swimmers, they are mammals and have to breathe and need to crawl up on ice floes. Queen Latifah's narration, co-authored by Al Gore's daughter Kristin, makes it clear that global warming is to blame. We see Nanu walking gingerly across ice that is alarmingly slushy, and we can only speculate about how that makes her feel. Advertisement The movie gives some attention to other northern ice forms, including jellyfish, birds and foxes who trail behind polar bears to eat the remains of their kills. We see no humans, not even the Inuit who assisted the filmmakers. In the end, I'm conflicted about the film. As an accessible family film, it delivers the goods. But it lives in the shadow of \"March of the Penguins.\" Despite its sad scenes, it sentimentalizes. It attributes human emotions and motivations to its central animals. Its music instructs us how to feel. And the narration and overall approach get in the way of the visual material."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Behind the Burly-Q", "Review": "My entry in the 1959 essay contest of the United Republican Fund won me a free trip to Chicago and the chance to shake Richard Nixon's hand during a banquet at the Chicago Amphitheater. What I remember about that trip is stepping into a cab in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel and telling the driver, \"take me to the best burlesque show in town.\" He threw down the flag on his meter and drove me one block, to the Rialto on South State Street.  In those days both the Rialto and the Follies survived as part of the last gasp of American burlesque. The Rialto had once been owned by Harold Minsky, Broadway's legendary burlesque impresario. There I beheld striptease artistes and a team of two comedians who told bawdy jokes about body parts, pulled improbable objects out of their pockets, and slapped each other with rubber chickens. Advertisement Burlesque survived there until the theaters were booked as porn houses. It made fitful revivals here and there around town, including at the Town, now the Park West, where in a seedy dressing room I interviewed the legendary Tempest Storm and found her kind and patient. Now it is gone and almost forgotten. Once it was known as the poor man's Broadway. A new documentary named \"Behind the Burly-Q\" recalls those days, but that's about all it accomplishes. It gathers an impressive series of talking head interviews with surviving stars, including Tempest Storm herself, looking pretty damned good for a redhead aged 82. In 1999 San Francisco mayor Willie Brown proclaimed a Tempest Storm Day. Catch Michael Bloomberg doing that. In its heyday a top-flight burlesque show would run 90 minutes and feature a large cast, elaborate costumes, energetic choreography and a nice little orchestra. Young comics got a start there, including Abbot and Costello. Alan Alda appears in this film to remember his father Robert, a straight man on 42nd Street. Burlesque was considered a step down from Vaudeville, although it was a lot classier than the nude revues and lap-dances that replaced it. There wasn't total nudity, for one thing, although Sally Rand caused a sensation at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair with her celebrated fan dance, during which she was apparently completely nude, but manipulated her fans so adroitly that you could never be absolutely sure. This proves the principle that it is more erotic to be about to see everything than it is to actually see it. Miss Rand died in 1979 at the age of 75, and was still dancing in that decade. I know that for a fact because my friend John McHugh has a photograph of himself with her to prove it. In the picture he is conducting himself as befits a reporter from the Chicago Daily News, while her perky nipples wink at him. \"Behind the Burly-Q,\" written and directed by the burlesque historian Leslie Zemeckis (wife of Robert), settles too easily for an editing formula which alternates talking heads, \u00a0too cursory performance footage and montages of headlines and photographs. The time line is unclear and the structure seems too random, but a composite picture emerges as young girls, often out of poverty, dream of stardom but end by taking it off. The successful ones had gimmicks. Lili St. Cyr appeared to make love with a parrot and Babette Bardot was allegedly Brigitte Bardot's sister. Their names showed some invention, for example Blaze Starr's; she famously had an affair with Louisiana governor Huey P. Long, and is in this film via telephone, refusing to be photographed. The many burlesque veterans who do appear in the film look, it must be said, like attractive seniors, and in their faces and voices we glimpse a spirit and defiance. They were overworked and underpaid and generally considered to be hookers, but they supported themselves, some from the age of 14. You hear some nostalgia, but with most of them you don't get the idea that if they had the chance they'd do it all again. Here is my interview with Tempest Storm. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Get Smart", "Review": "The closing credits of \u201cGet Smart\u201d mention Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, creators of the original TV series, as \u201cconsultants.\u201d Their advice must have been: \u201cIf it works, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d There have been countless comic spoofs of the genre founded by James Bond, but \u201cGet Smart\u201d (both on TV and now in a movie) is one of the best. It\u2019s funny, exciting, preposterous, great to look at, and made with the same level of technical expertise we\u2019d expect from a new Bond movie itself. And all of that is very nice, but nicer still is the perfect pitch of the casting. Advertisement Steve Carell makes an infectious Maxwell Smart, the bumbling but ambitious and unreasonably self-confident agent for CONTROL, a secret U.S. agency in rivalry with the CIA. His job is to decipher overheard conversations involving agents of KAOS, its Russian counterpart. At this he is excellent: What does it mean that KAOS agents discuss muffins? That they have a high level of anxiety, of course, because muffins are a comfort food. Brilliant, but he misses the significance of the bakery they\u2019re also discussing \u2014 a cookery for high-level uranium. Smart is amazingly promoted to a field agent by the Chief (Alan Arkin, calm and cool) and teamed with the beautiful Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway, who never tries too hard but dominates the screen effortlessly). They go to Russia, joining with Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson, once known as The Rock). Their archenemy is waiting for them; he\u2019s Siegfried (Terence Stamp), a cool, clipped villain. And that\u2019s about it, except for a series of special-effects sequences and stunt work that would truly give envy to a James Bond producer. \u201cGet Smart\u201d is an A-level production, not a cheapo ripoff, and some of the chase sequences are among the most elaborate you can imagine \u2014 particularly a climactic number involving planes, trains and automobiles. Maxwell Smart of course proves indestructible, often because of the intervention of Agent 99; he spends much of the center portion of the film in free-fall without a parachute, and then later is towed behind an airplane. The plot involves a KAOS scheme to nuke the Walt Disney concert hall in Los Angeles during a concert being attended by the U.S. president. The nuclear device in question is concealed beneath the concert grand on the stage, which raises the question: Since you\u2019re using the Bomb, does its location make much difference, give or take a few miles? It raises another question, too, and here I will be the gloom-monger at the festivities. Remember right after 9/11, when we wondered if Hollywood would ever again be able to depict terrorist attacks as entertainment? How long ago that must have been, since now we are blowing up presidents and cities as a plot device for Maxwell Smart. I\u2019m not objecting, just observing. Maybe humor has a way of helping us face our demons. Advertisement The props in the movie are neat, especially a Swiss Army-style knife that Maxwell never quite masters. The locations, many in Montreal, are awesome; I learned with amazement that Moscow was not one of them, but must have been created on a computer. The action-and-chase sequences do not grow tedious because they are punctuated with humor. I am not given to quoting filmmakers in praise of their own work in press releases, but director Peter Segal does an excellent job of describing his method: \u201cIf we plan a fight sequence as a rhythmic series of punches, we would have a \u2018bump, bump, bam\u2019 or a \u2018bump, bump, smack.\u2019 We can slot in a punchline instead of a physical hit. The rhythm accentuates the joke and it becomes \u2018bump, bump, joke\u2019 with the verbal jab as the knockout or a joke immediately followed by the last physical beat that essentially ends the conversation.\u201d Yes. And the jokes actually have something to do with a developing story line involving Anne Hathaway\u2019s love life, the reason for her plastic surgery, and a love triangle that is right there staring us in the face. One of the gifts of Steve Carell is to deliver punchlines in the middle of punches and allow both to seem real enough at least within the context of the movie. James Bond could do that, too. And in a summer with no new Bond picture, will I be considered a heretic by saying \u201cGet Smart\u201d will do just about as well?"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Triple 9", "Review": "There are movies about ugly, vile people, and there are\r\nugly, vile movies. \u201cTriple 9\u201d is the latter. Turning his interest in macho nihilism that he explored more\r\neffectively in \u201cThe Proposition\u201d and even the flawed \u201cLawless\u201d to bank robbers and the Russian mob, director John\r\nHillcoat again assembles a stunning cast of household names and proceeds to\r\nwaste almost all of their talents on an under-lit, increasingly ridiculous,\r\ngenerally ineffective dirty cop movie. It is a film that cribs openly from\r\nMichael Mann and Sidney Lumet without understanding what really makes either\r\ndirector work. Occasionally, the overwhelming talent of the cast will elevate\r\nthe material, but not nearly enough to shake the feeling when it\u2019s done that\r\nyou could use a shower. Advertisement The best scene in \u201cTriple 9\u201d is arguably its first real\r\nset-piece, the robbery of a downtown Atlanta bank by former special ops\r\nmastermind Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor), dirty cop #1 Marcus Belmont\r\n(Anthony Mackie), dirty cop #2 Jorge Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.), getaway\r\nman Russel Welch (Norman Reedus), and his brother Gabe (Aaron Paul), a\r\ncharacter who might as well being wearing a red shirt and named \u201cFuture\r\nLiability.\u201d Hillcoat and cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis (\u201cThe Drop\u201d)\r\nframe the bank robbery beautifully, taking us from the high-pressure of the\r\nvault to the getaway gone wrong after a red dye pack explodes. It\u2019s tense,\r\nwell-shot and sets up the audience for a high stakes thriller that never comes. It turns out the quintet wasn\u2019t there for the money\u2014they were\r\ntasked with stealing a very specific safety deposit box by Russian mob mastermind\r\nIrina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet), who is now refusing to pay the group until they\r\nperform another job. Irina has control over Michael because Michael has a son\r\nwith Irina\u2019s sister Elena (Gal Gadot) that the Russians are basically holding\r\nhostage, not allowing his father to see him. This plot thread is not only\r\npoorly-developed, it\u2019s a little morally grotesque in that it feels designed to\r\ncreate sympathy for someone who should be a villain, especially when we learn\r\nwhat the title means. If you don\u2019t know, 999 is the code for \u201cofficer down.\u201d In their\r\nplanning of the second heist, which involves a Homeland Security building, the\r\ngroup decides that the best way to distract the rest of the force will be to\r\nkill a cop. As they say, every car responds to a triple nine. And they\u2019ll all be\r\ndistracted enough to not be able to respond to the new heist. Conveniently,\r\nMarcus gets a green new partner in Chris Allen (Casey Affleck). They\u2019ll set up\r\nAllen to get killed, and pull off one final job for Irina while the city is\r\ndescending on the crime scene. They never bother to consider that Allen\u2019s uncle\r\n(Woody Harrelson) is leading the investigation into who they are. Or that the\r\nincreasingly unstable Gabe is a problem. Or that their entire plan is based on a lot\r\nof coincidences and plot holes that we only see in movies. Advertisement Most of \u201cTriple 9\u201d is shot in close-up and near-total\r\ndarkness. Hillcoat and Karakatsanis mistakenly think that this will compensate\r\nfor a lack of character or plot worth caring about. So, we get sweaty, dirty,\r\ngrimy camerawork, under-lit to a nearly-parodic degree, but none of it\r\nresonates beyond showy filmmaking. The film is constantly calling attention to\r\nits visual style (or lack thereof) because there\u2019s so little else on which to\r\nfocus. Despite casting so many talented people, writer Matt Cook and Hillcoat\r\ngive them almost nothing to do. They are cogs in a plot machine with nothing notable\r\nabout their characters or back stories outside of the descriptions you read\r\nabove. Michael has a kid. Gabe is the junkie. Chris is the new guy. That is it. If Hillcoat is trying to say\r\nanything about macho male behavior, the police force, capitalism, or even the\r\nRussian mob, he fails to do so.  The forgettable thinness of the characters is problematic\r\nthroughout but especially in the final act when one realizes you just don\u2019t\r\ncare about these people or what\u2019s going to happen to them. If one subscribes to\r\nthe theory that people can learn as much from a bad movie as from a good one,\r\nwatch the scenes between two of our best actors\u2014Kate Winslet and Chiwetel\r\nEjiofor. Neither have the depth of character or artful purpose that these\r\ntwo have brought to films before. And so their relationship, one of the\r\ndefining ones of the film, has no resonance at all. To be fair, Anthony Mackie\r\nhas so much natural charisma that it shines through every now and then and\r\nCasey Affleck sometimes looks like he\u2019s aware of the better film in which this\r\ncharacter could play a crucial role. It\u2019s also worth noting that when character\r\nhas to take a back seat\u2014in a few action sequences, including a riveting gang shoot-out,\r\nthe movie works. It\u2019s when dialogue and an increasingly-ludicrous plot kicks in\r\nthat the movie fails in head-shaking ways. Every talented cast member will move on from the errors of \u201cTriple\r\n9\u201d and on to bigger and better things. Most of them have already. Follow their\r\nlead."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Adderall Diaries", "Review": "\u201cThe Adderall Diaries\u201d begins with gibberish: \u201cWe understand the world by how we retrieve memories, re-order information into stories to justify how we feel.\u201d The quote is attributed to Stephen Elliott, the central character of this story and a real-life author, screenwriter and director (\"About Cherry\"). But in writer/director Pamela Romanowsky\u2019s adaptation of Elliott\u2019s memoir, Stephen is contextualized as a weaker James Franco film performance of the month, in a dull saga of memory, daddy issues, and slow motion flashbacks. Romanowksy's film is the type of writer's drama in which a tortured artist presents a manuscript at the end with the film's title on it.\u00a0 Advertisement This is the story of a past and present screw-up, who has made a career out of remembering and sharing his traumatic past. In sullen-covered books like \u201cA Part,\u201d he has written about the death of his mother, the abusiveness episodes of his now-deceased father, and living homeless or in group homes (presented to us in redundant slow motion, so that we can sense the seriousness of its dark atmosphere in case we didn\u2019t get that from a moody score, or claustrophobic close-ups of abuse).\u00a0This was his life before getting into Northwestern and becoming a writer, in spite of that opening quote.\u00a0 If only the story were this focused, but it is not. On top of an initially curious layer about a father and his traumatized son, Christian Slater has a small part as a father named Hans Reiser, who is accused of murdering the mother of his two kids and hiding the body. Stephen hears the story and wants to write about it, just because he can (\u201cI\u2019m not a reporter. I just want to write a book.\u201d) A cameo appearance from Wilmer Vanderrama as one of his friends helps get Stephen into Reiser\u2019s story, which in turn leads to a bizarre meet-cute with a New York Times reporter played by Amber Heard, another responsibility the film can\u2019t manage. It shifts from coming-of-age drama to writer-drama to Reiser\u2019s court case, without a full scope. It\u2019s a rare case where a longer running time (this one clocks around 86 minutes) might have made the script better.\u00a0 Stephen\u2019s bougie book club cred is challenged when his father (played by Ed Harris) shows up at one of Stephen\u2019s readings, and announces that the stories have been BS. But instead of facing the fire from a Gawker or Snopes investigation, very little happens. A huge chunk of Stephen\u2019s narrative may have been revealed to have been false, but publishers still seem interested. His editor (Cynthia Nixon) is patient with him, even when he constantly fails to deliver on a mere 20 pages a month. To sweeten his current dilemma, his new girlfriend has access to public records, so he can fix his father\u2019s mess with no problem. Potentially offensive to people who have suffered domestic abuse, and to writers who can\u2019t get a book deal, \u201cThe Adderall Diaries\u201d is a story of grotesque privilege, entitled by its demons to become a tortured artist tale.\u00a0 Advertisement Casting goes a long way with this project, to fill some of the gaps of charisma the story itself lacks. Franco knows that the character is challenging, yet even his game presence (a multi-hyphenate himself like Elliott) can\u2019t make Stephen a non-boring idea of a Adderall-sniffing, Macbook-typing selfish jerk. Heard makes the most of her abbreviated time (she has a full, tragic reaction when Stephen wants her to choke him to death, sexually). It\u2019s Harris who emerges with the most complete or interesting portrait, as an intense, regretful father, more complicated than Stephen\u2019s one-dimensional portrait of him.\u00a0 Franco and Harris have a couple of showdowns that at least start with grace, but flatline. The first one even ends with Franco scowling, sunglasses on, slowly backing out of a parking spot on his motorcycle. The slightly better emotional scene is at the end, but it involves us believing that Stephen still has a VHS player. \u201cThe Adderall Diaries\u201d is a competent, but it could be much more keen.\u00a0 Aside from Stephen, \u201cThe Adderall Diaries\u201d has its own problems with the past. Though the story starts with an interesting point that we may want to change our worst memories, Stephen apparently gets some very big details very wrong, as compared to what his father remembers. He might not be just repressed, but completely delusional. Who is right? In the end, does it matter anymore, outside of Stephen's book deal? Romanowsky's film leaves us not with an epiphany about different perspectives, but an empty gaze. The opening quote's half-assed logic doesn't entitle it a larger perspective."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Terminator Salvation", "Review": "One of Hollywood's oldest axioms teaches us: The story comes first. Watching \"Terminator Salvation,\" it occurred to me that in the new Hollywood, the storyboard comes first. After scrutinizing the film, I offer you my summary of the story: Guy dies, finds himself resurrected, meets others, fights. That lasts for almost two hours. The action scenes, which is to say, 90 percent of the movie, involve Armageddon between men and machines 10 years in the future. The film's most cheerful element is that they've perfected artificial intelligence so quickly. Yes, Skynet is self-aware and determines to wipe out humankind for reasons it doesn't explain. A last-ditch resistance is being led by John Connor, or \"J.C.\" for you Faulkner fans. Advertisement Christian Bale plays the role of Connor, in a movie that raises many questions about the lines between man and machine. Raises them, and then leaves them levitating. However, it has many fights between a humanoid cyborg and robotic Skynet men made of steel. How do these antagonists fight? Why, with their fists, of course, which remains a wonderfully cinematic device. They also shoot at each other, to little effect. In fact, one metal man is covered in molten ore and then flash-frozen, and keeps on tickin'. And listen, Skynet buddies, what Bale thought about that cameraman is only the tip of the iceberg compared to what he thinks about you. There is nothing visible in this world but a barren wasteland. No towns, no houses, no food, no farms, no nothing. Maybe they live on Spam. The resistance is run from a submarine commanded by Gen. Ashdown (Michael Ironside), who wants to destroy Skynet and all of its human POWs. Connor, who is not even human, vows to save them. Wait. That's Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), the guy from the past, who looks so much like Connor that maybe he only thinks he's Wright. Marcus is a convicted murderer from the past, awakened from cryogenic sleep.  I know with a certainty approaching dread that all of my questions will be explained to me in long detailed messages from \"Terminator\" experts. They also will charge me with not seeing the movie before I reviewed it. Believe me, I would have enjoyed traveling forward through time for two hours, starting just before I saw the movie. But in regard to the answers to my questions: You know what? I don't care. The first \"Terminator\" movie I regret (I suppose) I did not see. \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" (1991) was a fairly terrific movie, set in the (then) future, to prevent the nuclear holocaust of 1997. You remember that. It was about something. In it, Edward Furlong was infinitely more human as John Connor than Christian Bale is in this film. Advertisement Schwarzenegger, indeed, reappears in this fourth film, thanks to a body double and a special-effects face, which makes him, I think, a cyborg of a cyborg. His famous line \"I'll be back\" is uttered by one John Connor or another, and I hope it draws more chuckles than it did at the screening I attended. Why, those immortal words are chiseled into granite, or at least into the lobby floor at the AMC River East theaters. If there is one wholly sympathetic character, that would be Blair Williams, played by the fragrant Moon Bloodgood. She murmurs some tender words at the 45-minute mark, representing the most complex dialogue up to that point. Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) has a longer speech, but you can't be sure it's really her, and she may have been lying. Anyway, most of the running time is occupied by action sequences, chase sequences, motorcycle sequences, plow-truck sequences, helicopter sequences, fighter-plane sequences, towering android sequences and fistfights. It gives you all the pleasure of a video game without the bother of having to play it."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Demon House", "Review": "Zak Bagans, host of the Travel Channel series\u00a0\u201cGhost Adventures,\u201d is in the ghost-believing business\u2014his livelihood depends on viewers thinking that the supernatural exists, somehow. He takes that passion to\u00a0the film world with the\u00a0documentary \u201cDemon House,\u201d in which he thinks he has the Big Kahuna of ghost story opportunities: a crumbling house in Gary, Indiana that has been written about in various outlets for its demonic activity, and might even have a portal to hell in the basement. Purchasing the house right before he brings a crew\u00a0to Indiana, Bagans essentially hopes the estate\u00a0will help prove that ghosts are real, a goal that \u201cDemon House\u201d assuredly falls short of, and then some.\u00a0 Advertisement So that you don\u2019t have the same nagging curiosity that I did while first watching it, I can verify that this is a documentary by form\u00a0and not just a post-\u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d found footage con. The truth to the supernatural events in Gary is still nonetheless difficult to pin down, however much sensationalized journalism they inspired, but Bagans knows who he can use to corroborate his adventure: a woman like Latoya Ammons, whose children expressed different episodes\u00a0of being\u00a0possessed, a superstitious police officer, a priest who does exorcisms, etc. Experts are not consulted, nor are any party-pooping skeptics invited. It's telling that \"Demon House\" features a real-life exorcism, but it feels\u00a0more superficial than supernatural.\u00a0 \u201cDemon House\u201d in part\u00a0has\u00a0Bagans collecting previous accounts about the house's goings-on, complementing them with goofy reenactments that provide anti-tension, especially when it comes to scenes of the\u00a0Ammons kids freaking out with their eyes rolling to the back of their heads, or screaming in a strange voice. But the bad spirits, or so Bagans and company would like you to think, are ever present, and \u201cDemon House\u201d offers first-hand accounts of him and his crew capturing strange sounds, filming a shadow in a doorframe, or seeing\u00a0rising levels of magnetism in the basement, etc.\u00a0Sometimes there's even\u00a0surveillance footage of himself or others seemingly briefly possessed. With little filmmaking tact other than trying to prove he\u2019s right, it amounts to a hammy enterprise, like his\u00a0numerous unfortunate freeze frames that create accidental punchlines whenever someone says something ominous.\u00a0 Happenings do get stranger as Bagans\u2019 investigation continues, offering a fleeting hope that this could be the rare horror documentary that\u2019s actually scary. Bagans\u2019 cameraman Adam is later affected by being in the house, and a parapsychologist named Barry Taff (author of Aliens Above, Ghosts Below) experiences physical repercussions, or so we're told. (The kookiness of \u201cDemon House\u201d might have fared better if it were more a sociological look at people who believe this stuff, looking at it not from Bagans' perspective,\u00a0but I digress.) As \u201cDemon House\u201d yearns to have its own real-life moments from something like a \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d movie, Bagans\u2019 film still offers plenty of skepticism, especially whenever it seems possible that it's only the\u00a0bad acting from the child reenactments that's possessing\u00a0Adam or Barry's dramatic turns. It proves to be\u00a0incredibly tedious when you can\u2019t trust your documentarian or even the possible true suffering of his friends, as they collectively\u00a0inspire more of a \u201cwho cares?\u201d than \u201cwho knows?\u201d reaction\u00a0about the existence of demons and whatnot.\u00a0 Advertisement But it\u00a0proves to be\u00a0shocking most of all\u00a0watching the doc that Bagans has at least 100 episodes of \u201cGhost Adventures\u201d behind him. Aside from the authority he claims on-camera when playing ghost host, he\u2019s a notably dull surrogate into these possibly supernatural events. His voiceover sounds tired, and his words lack even more spirit: \u201cThis is the case that really f**ked me up.\u201d Followed up later by, \u201cThis was some serious sh*t that meant something.\u201d And then his glorious send-off: \u201cLike I said at the beginning, this story is cursed.\u201d Maybe that shrugging nature is fair game\u00a0in between commercial breaks,\u00a0but within a feature-length documentary\u00a0it makes him all the more a storyteller you can't believe, or trust."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "At Middleton", "Review": "It is somewhat refreshing that \"At Middleton\", a middling romantic comedy set during a tour of a scenic college campus, focuses on a couple of adults at a crossroads in their lives rather than a pair of entitled adolescents pondering which prospective institute of higher education to attend. What proves less than satisfying is how much energy director/co-writer Adam Rodgers expends to simply prove the mossy adage that opposites do indeed attract.  Like their characters, first-time co-stars Andy Garcia and Vera Farmiga at least have one commonality. Both broke out in gangster dramas: For him, 1990's \"The Godfather Part III\", and for her, 2006's \"The Departed\". As the gap between those years suggests, the male of this potential love-match equation is a tad old for the female half (Garcia is 57, Farmiga is 40). In this area, \"At Middleton\" faithfully upholds one of Hollywood's favorite double standards.  Advertisement As for Garcia's George, a heart surgeon, and Farmiga's Edith, a retailer of children's furniture, both parents are accompanying their only offspring on a road-trip quest to decide their academic futures. And that is where the similarities end. Bow-tie enthusiast George is an uptight square who shuns taking risks. Unconventional Edith is a mouthy free spirit for whom rules are meant to be broken.  Of course, his happy-go-lucky son, Conrad (Spencer LoFranco), is maddeningly cavalier about their mission while her daughter, Audrey (Farmiga's look-alike teen sister Taissa), is a humorless perfectionist who leaves little to chance. After revealing that Audrey Hepburn inspired her child's name, Edith admits, \"I should have named her Benito.\"  After Edith starts to annoy other visitors by peppering the overtly sincere student tour guide (who declares that his dual major of horticulture and music qualifies him as a \"dingleberry\"\u2014and, no, that label isn't funny no matter how many times it is repeated) with questions about the rate of murders and rape at Middleton, the two parents decide to explore the environs on their own.  You know things are about to go middle-age crazy when Edith suggests to George that they \"borrow\" two abandoned bicycles they happen upon along the way. \"This is fate,\" she says giddily. \"This is theft,\" he says nervously. And off they go.  Somewhere between creating a disturbance at the library, climbing to the top of a bell tower where George panics over his fear of heights, performing a flirtatious duet of Chopsticks on a piano, disrupting a drama class before giving an impromptu master class in improv and getting stoned with a pre-med student and his girlfriend, these madcap gadabouts reveal to one another that they both are married. And not necessarily happily, especially now that their kids won't be around much longer to provide an emotional buffer against any marital strife. Advertisement It is hard to root for their possible infidelity, considering we barely know any details about George and Edith's personal situations, other than they are all too willing to abandon their children with barely a second thought and frolic about on their own.  Matters would grow more tiresome if not for two welcome if all too brief appearances by a couple of cool cats who act as surrogate parents. Former \"Animal House\" rowdy Peter Riegert does his best Wolfman Jack imitation as a DJ named Boneyard Sims who initiates Conrad into the ways of collegiate radio hosting. A handsomely wizened Tom Skerritt gets to put presumptuous Audrey in her place as the esteemed professor of linguistics that she has idolized since the ninth grade.  \"At Middleton\" is the just the sort of trite if inoffensive diversion that barely tiptoes into theaters before landing in the cable and video-on-demand listings. And Garcia and Farmiga, as good as they can be in the right roles, aren't doing themselves or their careers any favors with this sort of C-level effort.  At least the ending is brazen enough not to conclude in a tidy fashion. But watching George and Edith cavort in slo-mo while being drenched in a campus fountain is antithesis of enjoying \"Annie Hall\" and Alvy Singer as those classic polar opposites engage in battle against a runaway lobster. One scene has comic snap. The other is merely soggy."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Private Violence", "Review": "In the recent uproar following the release of the video footage showing  Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punching his wife Janay in the  elevator, a hashtag started trending on Twitter: #WhyIStayed. Beverly  Gooden, from North Carolina, did not watch the elevator footage, but  heard the commentary, the overwhelming refrain being, \"Why didn't she  just leave?\" A survivor of domestic violence herself, Gooden went on  Twitter and began a series of Tweets about why she stayed. The hashtag  started trending, as more and more people started sharing their stories.  It made national news. HBO's new feature-length documentary, \"Private  Violence,\" directed by Cynthia Hill, has been over a decade in the  making, but its release could not come at a more opportune time. A look  at the complexity of domestic violence, especially when it comes to the  difficulty of prosecuting abusers in a court of law, \"Private Violence\" keeps its focus narrow, a smart choice, following around Kit Gruelle, a victims' advocate from North Carolina. Advertisement Kit Gruelle lives in the mountains of North Carolina, and works with  women's shelters and law enforcement on various domestic abuse cases  about to enter the court system. She also trains first responders,  police officers and hostage negotiators on the complexities of what  goes on in domestic abuse situations. There is a fascinating scene  showing a role-playing scenario where two cops in training interview an  arguing \"couple\" (in reality, domestic abuse advocates). The cops  afterwards are taught what they did right, what they did wrong, what  signals they missed and what red flags they ignored. This is very important  work. Misconceptions and preconceived notions, not to mention  prejudices and judgmental attitudes, leave victims at risk. As a survivor of an abusive relationship herself, Gruelle is able to  communicate powerfully to those who cannot understand why people stay in  violent situations, and why they often keep going back. At one point, when  describing her own relationship, Gruelle says, \"I would always go back  because at least then I knew where he was.\" \"Private Violence\" highlights the diversity of  Gruelle's tasks, featuring her driving around from courthouses to  shelters to doctor's offices, back to her home in the mountains. There  are a couple of moments where Gruelle is shown listening to something,  the testimony of a survivor, or, in one scene, a terrible tape sent to  her of a man whipping his wife, screaming \"Don't you ever cross me!,\" and,  in those scenes, Hill zooms in on Gruelle's eyes, catching the  intensity of the listening going on there. Those are riveting and  empathetic moments. One can see why Hill was so taken with Gruelle as a  subject. \"Private Violence\" also presents the horrifying case of Deanna Walters, a woman kidnapped by her husband  and driven across the country against her will with their 2 1/2-year-old  daughter. He beat Deanna all along the way; so badly in Oklahoma that  he almost killed her. The police officer who finally pulled the truck  over and called an ambulance, said, \"In the 15 years I've been a law  enforcement officer, I've never seen anybody in a car wreck as badly  beat up as that girl.\" However, Deanna's husband was not charged with  anything and allowed to return home to North Carolina. Deanna's daughter  was placed in foster care (Deanna saying, quietly, \"That destroyed  me.\") Because the two had crossed so many state lines, and because  Deanna didn't know what state she was in half the time, there was fear  that the case would get lost in the shuffle, and that nobody would want  to prosecute it on a state-level. Gruelle and others hoped that his  multiple crimes (kidnapping, assault) could be tried in a federal court  where the punishment might be steeper. (Gruelle is quick to point out  the terrible irony that kidnapping is a worse offense in the eyes of the  law than beating someone so badly she almost dies and continues to have  seizures as a result of the beating.) Deanna Walters had been asked  repeatedly, by friends, family, and then law enforcement and lawyers,  the common question: \"Why didn't you leave him?\" Gruelle points out:  Deanna did leave him. And he retaliated by kidnapping  her and then almost killing her. Advertisement \"Private Violence\" is the story the important  work of Gruelle, of Deanna Walters' case, and of the American court  system, the giant loopholes in the law, and the multiple problems with  enforcing restraining orders (as well as prosecuting those who violate  such orders.) Gruelle, appearing on a radio show, comes with a stack of  files over a foot high of restraining orders that had been violated, resulting in the women being murdered. Gruelle says, \"I refer to  restraining orders as a last will and testament.\" As long as survivors are asked \"Why didn't you just leave?\" there will  be a need for advocates such as Kit Gruelle. And as long as there are  people out there like Gruelle, doing the frustrating and often thankless  work of not only keeping victims safe but bringing their abusers to  justice, there is hope. \"Private Violence\" is extremely sad, but it has a lot of hope. \"Private Violence\" opened Friday in limited release and plays tonight, October 20, 2014 on HBO."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Hunt", "Review": "Mads Mikkelsen\u2019s face suggests weathered, weary iciness: slit-like eyes, thin lips, skin pulled tightly across high cheekbones. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Danish actor \u2014 who is best known to American audiences as the bad guy in \"Casino Royale,\" and currently plays Hannibal Lecter on NBC\u2019s \"Hannibal\" \u2014 is so often typecast as a villain. Thomas Vinterberg\u2019s new drama, \"The Hunt,\" allows Mikkelsen to go beyond appearances and showcase his versatility. Wearing wire-frame glasses, his blond hair combed forward, Mikkelsen stars as Lucas, a kindly daycare employee who is falsely accused of exposing himself to a child. His performance \u2014 which won Best Actor at this year's Cannes Film Festival \u2014 is a nuanced portrait of a fundamentally decent man grappling with a world that has decided to treat him indecently.  Advertisement \"The Hunt\" begins with Lucas leading a contented (though not exactly perfect) life in a small town. A teacher by training, he has been left jobless by the closing of the local school; now he works in a daycare, looking after kids during the day and drinking with their parents in the evening. He radiates a sort of quiet, reserved warmth. His caring is genuine, and inspires others to care about him; friends worry that he's lonely, living all by himself in the house he once shared with his son and ex-wife.  Everything changes, however, when \u2014 in a moment of anger \u2014 one of Lucas' charges tells the daycare owner he sexually abused her. \"The Hunt\" doesn\u2019t play any is-he-or-isn't-he games with the accusation; it's clear to us from the start that it\u2019s a lie. While the unsuspecting Lucas goes about his work, the daycare scrambles to investigate. A child psychologist is brought in. Damage control is planned.  Finally, Lucas' boss brings him into her office to tell him about what's been going on behind his back; however, she refuses to reveal the name of the accuser or the nature of accusation. Lucas is told to take a few days off while the matter gets sorted out. The parents are all called to the daycare and told about the accusation.  From there, the accusation snowballs. Given a vague list of \"symptoms\" of sexual abuse \u2014 everything nightmares to moodiness \u2014 the parents all become convinced that Lucas has molested their children. If it weren't played so straight, \"The Hunt\" could be taken as a satire of overprotective parenting; when the accuser attempts to recant, it's interpreted as a sign of the severity of Lucas' abuse.  Things only get worse when the authorities refuse to charge him due to an overwhelming lack of evidence. Instead of vindicating him, this leads the community to believe that a predatory pedophile has been allowed to roam free in their town. Advertisement  This is where \"The Hunt\" arrives at its real subject: false guilt. Lucas is treated like a criminal by his community; his innocence is irrelevant. With subtle control of his face and voice, Mikkelsen conveys the inner turmoil of a man who is being forced to feel guilty about a crime that never happened.  \"The world is full of evil \u2014 but if we hold on to each other, it goes away,\" says one character toward the end of the film. The words are meant to comfort, but instead, they distress. \"The Hunt\" shows a community banding together against an individual; in the guise of making evil \"go away,\" they commit evil themselves.  This is thematically rich material; unfortunately, like a few too many dramas from the past decade, \"The Hunt\" resists expressive uses of style, opting instead for gently bobbing handheld camerawork. It's an actor-friendly approach \u2014 face-focused, with minimal set-up time \u2014 but it ends up limiting the movie to the quality of its performances. It can only convey what the actors are conveying with their voices and faces \u2014 nothing more.  Admittedly, the actors manage to convey quite a bit, often subtly. Vinterberg \u2014 who broke through with \"The Celebration\" (1998), which also dealt with child molestation, but whose arthouse cred was eroded by a couple of critical flops (\"It\u2019s All About Love,\" \"Dear Wendy\") \u2014 has settled into being a capable director of actors. Along with Mikkelsen's leading role, \"The Hunt\" also boasts standout turns from newcomer Annika Wedderkopp as Lucas' accuser and Vinterberg regular Thomas Bo Larsen as the friend whose rejection hurts Lucas the most. However, one often wishes for counterpoint \u2014 for the camera to play off of the performances instead of merely recording them."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Edge of Darkness", "Review": "Can we think of Mel Gibson simply as an action hero? A star whose personal baggage doesn't upstage his performances? I find that I can. He has made deplorable statements in recent years, which may be attributed to a kind of fanatic lunacy that can perhaps be diagnosed as a disease. The fact remains that in \"Edge of Darkness\" he remains a likable man with a natural screen presence. Here he plays a Boston cop named Craven (always a dependable movie name). The great love of his life is his daughter, Emma (Bojana Novakovic). She works for a giant, secretive corporation named Northmoor. Few corporations with \"moor\" in their titles are wholly trustworthy; we think too much about bodies being buried there. Advertisement Emma comes home for a visit, rather unexpectedly. She is having nosebleeds. A bleeding nose can be a symptom of numerous disorders, but in a thriller, as we all know, there's only one possible diagnosis. Emma has hardly arrived when there's a knock on the door, they answer it together, and a man in a hood screams \"Craven!\" and shoots her dead. It is assumed that the detective Thomas Craven was the intended target. Craven's not so sure. His investigation leads him to Northmoor and its silky, sinister chairman, Jack Bennett (Danny Huston, ominously courteous, just as his father was in \"Chinatown\"). Bennett tears himself away from planning Northmoor's campaign contributions long enough to greet Craven in his office, atop a towering aerie overlooking his feudal lands. Because much of the movie is a cranked-up thriller with chases, fights, conspiracies and all that stuff, permit me a digression on secretive, shadowy corporations. What kinds of headquarters buildings do they inhabit? I Googled. Blackwater, which supplies our mercenaries in Iraq, has a drab two-story building outside Cleveland, with eight cars parked in front. Halliburton, Dick Cheney's old company, recently moved from Houston to an anonymous skyscraper in -- Dubai, closer to its place of business. I mention this because Northmoor -- which you will not be surprised to learn traffics in illegal, traitorous and dangerous activities -- occupies a spectacular structure atop a tall riverside hill, visible from miles around: Its tower, its modernistic design, its curious enormous gleaming globe, suggesting a planetarium. It is a building worthy of magazine covers, not least Architectural Digest. One purpose of corporate architecture is to impress. Northmoor's desire is to impress us, the moviegoer. Its structure looks left over from a James Bond movie, and indeed the \"Edge of Darkness\" director, Martin Campbell, made \"Casino Royale\" (2007). It's the kind of edifice that inspires such questions as, \"What do they do in there?\" Much of what they do takes place in enormous buried spaces within the hill. This low-profile corporation undertook a construction project on a par with a subway line. Advertisement I explain this not merely to avoid discussing the off-the-shelf thriller plot, but to illustrate that \"Edge of Darkness,\" like so many recent thrillers, has no ambition to be taken seriously. If the corporation were more realistic, the movie would be, too. And then the fate of the world wouldn't depend yet once again on One Cop . . . With Nothing to Lose . . . On a Personal Mission. Gibson inhabits this gazebo with as much conviction as is probably possible. He's joined in this by the superb British actor Ray Winstone, as an intriguing free agent who turns up in Craven's garden one night with a cigar and an enigmatic line of patter. Who does he work for? Why does he know so much? Why does he work alone? He reminds me of a man I know, Jean-Jacques de Mesterton, who told me, \"If you have a problem, you go to the cops. If they can't help you, you go to the FBI. If they can't help you, you go to the CIA. If they can't help you, you come to me.\" Winstone's interaction with Gibson provides the movie with much of its interest. For the rest, it's a skillful exercise in CGI and standard-order thriller supplies. Gibson is a credible, attractive hero, as he has always been, so if you want fast-food action, here's your movie. It does have a useful subtext. It serves as a reminder that the purpose of a corporation is not to be patriotic, but to maximize profits for its officers and shareholders. This is required by its by-laws. I suppose if we, as shareholders, don't agree with its profit-making strategies, we can always sell our stock, assuming we can find out what those strategies are."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "A Beautiful Planet", "Review": "\u201cA Beautiful Planet\u201d is a 49-minute documentary made partly by amateur cameramen, but like previous IMAX-produced shorts, it is fine blockbuster filmmaking. Similar to \u201cGravity\u201d or \u201cAvatar,\u201d it offers viewers experiences that can only be seen in large scope storytelling, this one coming with the budget of NASA trips to the International Space Station. Its lead characters and cinematographers are the astronauts who share with us their workday, in and out of the office, and the endlessly fascinating view they have outside their windows.\u00a0 Advertisement Treating its title very broadly, the movie goes in many different directions. It wants to be about the formation of the planet, its current state, and careening future. On top of this, it wants to focus on life for various astronauts in the International Space Station, which does provide a metaphor for Jennifer Lawrence's narration: \"A truly awesome example of what we can achieve when we work together.\" The overall package is a bit scattered editorially, but it does serve a greater purpose: to share excitement about the Earth, and further stoke any interests in not destroying it.\u00a0 The footage captured is, of course, spectacular. Wide overhead shots of entire planetary regions take precedence over talking head interviews, as Myers shows us the world in day and night, we hear the voices of astronauts sharing their observations below. The light of South Korea dies at its border with North Korea. In daytime satellite views, Earth is shown nakedly in its land formations, with Africa\u2019s vastly depleting greens, or a dry, carved out California. These satellite images are seamlessly mixed with animated explorations into the Milky Way and beyond infinite, with \u201cA Beautiful Planet\u201d leaving us with the possibility of life elsewhere on another planet called Kepler-186f, 490 light-years away from Earth.\u00a0 The film has a curiosity as a type of NASA PR moment, like an exercise in providing the most accessible piece of educational entertainment possible within 49 minutes. It\u2019s constantly bidding for your awe, as when mixing astronauts talking about their daily lives up above (washing their hair, trying to make espresso, exercising, all of them fascinating anti-gravity feats) with their observations on the world below. You can also hear the producing too, as when the narration frames global warming as something that will directly affect the lemurs\u2019 habitat (already a subject of their 2014 IMAX short, \u201cIsland of Lemurs: Madagascar\u201d), or using New Orleans as a loaded example of a city that will flood from a rise in the sea-level.\u00a0 Advertisement Jennifer Lawrence's voiceover guiding is in a way soothing, perhaps too soothing. Her voice is kind to the ear as always, but her personality minimized. Instead of inspiring a sense of awe, it's more about getting the information with a name to put on the poster in the process. It brings to mind Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s similar voiceover work for Myers' previous \u201cHubble 3D\u201d IMAX doc, which sounded as instructional as his exposition moments from the first-half of Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cInception.\u201d\u00a0 There is a difference between reading there are an estimated hundred billion galaxies and to feeling like you have seen them, while understanding you're just a grain of sand among it all. \u201cA Beautiful Planet\u201d achieves this unique sensation with a perspective that alternates between a massive and minute scope. It is a blockbuster experience of the God\u2019s-eye view."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Mr. Roosevelt", "Review": "Emily Martin (No\u00ebl Wells) doesn't quite know how to explain what it is she does, or even what it is she wants to do. She's not exactly an actress. She's not exactly a comedian either. She hangs around improv clubs in Los Angeles, but feels put off by the whole \"scene.\" She made one YouTube video that went viral, but she couldn't \"monetize\" it. Emily is first shown during an audition in which she transforms herself in quick succession since she only has five minutes, into Holly Hunter at a garage sale, Kristen Wiig coming across a murder, a Vine video of someone tripping at a Beyonce concert, and a \"girl who's always cold.\" The casting director is frozen in fear at the rollicking manic display. Emily tromps off to her gig editing videos in some random apartment crowded with people on laptops. All of this occurs in the first five minutes of Wells' first feature as a writer and director, \"Mr. Roosevelt.\" Anyone who has ever circulated, even peripherally, in any comedy club scene, will recognize all of it. It's a quick-flash study of both frenzied activity and crushing ennui.\u00a0 Advertisement Emily is a transplant to Los Angeles from Austin, Texas. She is unmoored. The \"industry\" has no idea what to do with someone like her. She\u00a0doesn't know what to do, and her awkward self-deprecation makes others recoil from her. When her ex-boyfriend Eric (Nick Thune) calls to let her know that her cat\u2014Mr. Roosevelt\u2014has died, Emily dissolves into tears and books the first flight back to Austin she can find.\u00a0 Wells is an established actress and writer. With a recurring role on \"Master of None,\" and a brief stint on \"Saturday\u00a0Night Live,\" she also recently played Jessica Williams' best friend in \"The Incredible Jessica James,\" and was funny support staff to the lead. In her first film as a writer-director, she presents a world she clearly knows well. From Texas originally, Wells filmed \"Mr. Roosevelt\" around Austin, with the clear familiarity of a local. Austin residents will probably pick up more of her commentary than outsiders, but it's clear what she's getting at when she shows Emily's disappointment at the closing of her favorite coffee shop. Austin is gentrifying. Wells has been very smart in creating the lead character, both in the writing, and the performing. She presents Emily in broad strokes at first\u2014the audition, a one-night stand with a guy who never puts down his phone (even when her head is in his crotch), her free-floating ambition for a career\u2014but much of it works by stealth. You have to put it together as you go. Wells herself is very endearing as a personality, so it takes a while to really \"get\" that Emily is kind of a nightmare. For example, she arrives in Austin with just a backpack, having made no arrangements for where she will stay. She clearly assumes she will stay with her ex in the house where they once lived together, even though he is involved in a brand-new relationship. This is a woman who does not have her act together. Over the course of the film, her nonexistent \"act\" will deteriorate even further, as she thrashes about in jealousy at her ex's perfect new girlfriend, bristles at questions about her life in Los Angeles, and ratchets up her competitive mourning for the aforementioned cat Mr. Roosevelt. It's not that Emily is not likable. It's that she's a mess. Being a mess is extremely human.\u00a0 Eric's new girlfriend is the kind of woman designed to make insecure women feel worse. She is, as Emily complains, a \"Pinterest board come to life.\" Celeste, played by Britt Lower with impenetrable calm that also manages to be very funny, is an \"entrepreneur,\" equally handy with whipping up mimosas and whipping out a drill. Eric\u2014once a musician\u2014is now studying to get his real estate license. Emily compliments Eric on a shirt he's wearing and he replies, \"It's breathable cotton.\" He drinks oolong tea now. Emily is horrified. She doesn't even know who he is anymore. At a disastrous group dinner at a restaurant, Emily meets Jen (the wonderful Daniella Pineda) while having a private freakout in the bathroom, and Jen matter-of-factly throws a glass of water in Emily's face to snap her out of hysteria. It's the beginning of a beautiful friendship. The premise of \"Mr. Roosevelt\" is pretty slight, but it's filled with funny performances and biting snippets of social commentary. There's a really well-done sequence\u2014the most evocative in the film\u2014where Emily hangs out with Jen and her friends at a watering hole, and they get stoned and all take their tops off (\"It's legal here,\" someone drawls) and do cannon balls into the water, or tiptoe across the rocks in an awkward kick-line. The nudity is playful, innocent, and captures Austin\u2014its essence and vibe, a vibe Wells clearly loves. Emily's behavior leads her on a collision course with Celeste, with Eric, with her own life, and even with Jen, who constantly has a glass of water at the ready should Emily ratchet it up again. Advertisement Wells has given us a personal and extremely observant story, with moments of honesty and humor. She is fair to every character. Even Celeste ends up being multi-layered. Wells is a talented writer and has woven together the strands into a humorous whole. The film could have been choppily episodic, or had the unfortunate structure of sketched-in \"bits\" unconnected to a narrative. Instead, it's a funny story about a funny woman who finally realizes it's time to grow up. It is a \"win\" for women in film when one of the biggest blockbusters of the year, and a \"superhero comic book movie\" no less, is directed by a woman. Patty Jenkins, in directing \"Wonder Woman,\" has broken through a certain glass ceiling. When I interviewed director/cinematographer Reed Morano in 2015 about her first feature, \"Meadowland,\" I asked her about the challenges faced by female directors in the industry, and she said, \"Isn't it weird that this male director who has only directed a $2 million dollar Sundance movie is now suddenly directing a hundred-million-dollar Marvel movie, for his second film? And you definitely don't see happen that with women. There's a discrepancy there.\" But while it's great to see women move into bigger budget film-making, it's even more important that women create their own\u00a0stories, do what they want to do. I would hate to see the equation Blockbuster = Success. The more women develop their own projects, produce their own films, make films their way, telling the stories they want to tell, the healthier the industry will be. Wells' \"Mr. Roosevelt\" is part of that."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "You Again", "Review": "If only \u201cYou Again\u201d understood that its story was suited for screwball comedy. It labors under the delusion that this assembly of half-baked ideas is destined for a higher comic calling \u2014 for example, in the warm-hearted romantic weeper category. The movie is so laboriously contrived in every atom of its being that the only interest is in seeing if the characters can avoid the destinies decreed for them by ancient formulas. No luck. Those who hate each other at the beginning will forgive each other at the end. Those who try to deceive will have their deceptions unmasked. Those destined for love will find it, but not without an obligatory setback at the 66 percent point. If there is a party, it will go wrong. If there is a tree house, it will fall out of the tree. If it is necessary to improvise a wedding at a hospital, a ward will be cleared to make space for a wedding so elaborate it would look unlikely in a church. I hope they save pieces of the wedding cake for the patients whose beds have been wheeled out into the hallway. Advertisement The actors are plucky. They're stuck in a movie that gives their characters not even a chance at a human characteristic. Benevolence, jealousy, resentment, charity, wisdom, disappointment and love are turned on and off like water faucets, often with only a few lines of motivation. Occupations are like name tags: Wise old dad is revealed as a \u201cdoctor,\u201d mom runs a \u201cbakery,\u201d daughter in her 20s is \u201cvice president of a national public relations firm,\u201d brother is a \u201clawyer,\u201d his fiancee is \u201cworking with the sick and underprivileged,\u201d the fiancee's mother \u201cowns 14 hotels\u201d and a private jet. None of these jobs figures in any way in the plot, except that the hotelier knows how to say three words in each of six languages. (She is played by Sigourney Weaver with such latent energy that I'm sure she would know more words if this movie were not rated PG.) The heroine is Marni (Kristen Bell). In high school, she wore braces and glasses, was pimply and was called \u201cMoo\u201d because her initials were M.O.O. (Hint: Don't use your middle name.) She is a blond, of course, and was bullied by a brunette, of course. This was Joanna (Odette Yustman), who has now morphed into Florence Nightingale. Her mother is Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis), and wouldn't you know Gail went to high school with Joanna's Aunt Ramona (Sigourney Weaver), and they \u2014 oh, never mind. Marni's grandmother Bunny is played by Betty White, who I urgently advise to start playing against type, because the standard 88-year-old Betty White, although one hell of a woman, has grown a tad over-familiar.  There were two parts of the movie I liked. The beginning, with a voiceover by the then-unpopular high school sophomore version of Marni, starts out funny before the plot settles in. And there is a moment when Aunt Ramona and mother Gail find out they were on the same cheerleader squad, and do an awesomely physical cheer together. That is flat-out funny. Apart from that, the movie's pleasures are scant, apart from its observance of Gene Siskel's Rule of Swimming Pool Adjacency, which states that when well-dressed people are near a swimming pool, they will \u2014 yeah, you got it.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Art of Getting By", "Review": "George, the hero of \"The Art of Getting By,\" is a high school senior who has decided to stop doing homework and paying any attention to tests. He isn't tortured, depressed, addicted or anything like that. It has occurred to him that he will die, and therefore what use is homework? This is more sophisticated than my theory, which was that homework would kill me. George is played by Freddie Highmore, who only yesterday was the kid in \"August Rush.\" He could make a durable leading man because he looks good, and by that I don't mean handsome, I mean kind and likable. He's nice even when he explains to his parents and teachers that he doesn't see the point in graduating from school. He's the spiritual kin of Melville's Bartleby the scrivener, who patiently informed people, \"I would prefer not to.\"  Advertisement By not assigning a fixable reason for George's behavior, the movie sidesteps some of the cliches of the teen problem picture. Not all of them. There's always romance. George, for example, is attracted to Sally (Emma Roberts), a classmate who he assumes is somehow beyond his reach. In this he isn't being defeatist but, he thinks, simply realistic. If he were a little more perceptive, he'd realize Sally likes him a whole lot. His life seems stuck on pause. His passivity is both interesting and frustrating, because George possesses the answers to all of his problems and freely chooses to be unhappy. As a result, most of the tension generated by the movie is in ourselves and not in the plot. We want George to succeed, we want him together with Sally, and we even like Dustin (Michael Angarano), an older artist who likes Sally and likes George, too. Dustin is so nice, he would step aside from Sally if he thought George was ever going to make a move. Not likely in romance, but there you have it. George's mother and stepfather (Rita Wilson and Sam Robards) are concerned, but curiously distant. The family is obviously affluent, but isn't obsessed with George graduating or getting into a good school. He is spared counseling or diagnosis, and we later learn about their distractions. But his school is very engaged, especially his principal (Blair Underwood), his English teacher (Alicia Silverstone), and his bearded and irascible art teacher (Jarlath Conroy). They come up with a deadline that would provide more tension if it were not so clear that a film like this requires George to meet it. That leads to a rather sadistic scene in which George must actually attend his school graduation ceremony to find out if he's graduating. This last-instant verdict has been brought about by the principal, who, until this point in the film, has been unfailingly kind and understanding. I fear the scene exists for the single purpose of concocting an ending for the screenplay. It shouldn't be so obvious. Another problem involves certain details of the relationship between Sally and Dustin that I don't want to spoil for you. Let me use evasive language. With what is implied by her apparent decision, we must assume emotional decisions on her part that aren't consistent with her eventual choices. You'll see what I mean. \"The Art of Getting By\" is pleasant and well-acted and easy to watch. I wouldn't advise against seeing it, because it showcases Freddie Highmore and Emma Roberts (Julia's niece), and they are likely to do greater things, but at the end, I was wondering, what is the point? Nice people lead enviable lives, the hero can solve most of his own problems, and the villain is a sweetheart. It's custard without the lemon. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Copenhagen", "Review": "A guy and a girl bicycle slowly through the streets of  Copenhagen, the colored buildings and wide canals their placid and  beautiful backdrop. The sun is setting, the shadows lengthening, making  the city seem less like an actual place than a dream space, one where  truth can come out, where the regular rules of everyday life no longer  apply, where something else is possible. In its best  moments, \"Copenhagen,\" the debut feature of Mark Raso, who also wrote  the script, takes place in that dream space. Advertisement On the surface, the film sounds like Richard Linklater's \"Before  Sunrise\" or any number of other meet-cute-in-a-foreign-city stories.  But very quickly, other things start to come to the surface, things that  don't quite fit. The tension between the expectations that arise due to the familiar genre and what is actually happening onscreen makes \"Copenhagen\" special, and a bit strange. There's also  the undeniable fact that the girl in the film is, in actuality, a girl. She's half the age of William, the lead  character. So any possibility of romance is distinctly illegal in  nature. \"Copenhagen\" doesn't shy away from that, and is unafraid to  allow that queasy reality to come to the surface. The film doesn't  entirely work, but sometimes things that don't entirely work are  interesting, bringing tension and unresolved issues that start to take  over the film, almost by stealth. It's nice to watch something that  isn't neat, that doesn't play it safe. William (Gethin Anthony) and his pal Jeremy (Sebastian Armesto) are  traveling through Europe, crashing in youth hostels. The whole point of  the trip is to end up in Copenhagen, where William can try to track down  the grandfather he's never met. William's dad was abandoned by his  father. And William's dad was no great shakes in the father department  either. William has a lot of free-floating resentment and rage because  of that. He found an unsent letter his father wrote to his grandfather.  It's in Danish so he has no idea what it says, but he wants to deliver  the letter, decades after it was written. You get the sense that William  is not looking for a loving reconciliation but confirmation that father  figures suck. The trip immediately goes off the rails because Jeremy has brought along  a girlfriend. William is so hostile and unpleasant from the get-go that  it starts to call into question his presence as the lead of the film.  He's nasty to Jeremy's girlfriend in a particularly lecherous way; he's  vicious to Jeremy when they argue about her; he's a whiny petulant  figure. This nastiness is not just an attitude, it's William's default  personality. Gethin Anthony is excellent in that he does not soft-pedal  these qualities, and does not try to plead his character's case for the  audience. He allows William to be as nasty as he is written. It can make  \"Copenhagen\" a trying experience, but there is interesting stuff on the  other side of it. Advertisement After William and Jeremy part ways, William is left to his own devices  in Copenhagen. He needs to find the address on the envelope because he thinks maybe his grandfather still lives there. His initial queries are unsuccessful.  Everything changes when he meets Effy (Frederikke Dahl Hansen), a  waitress in the hotel cafe where he is staying. She clumsily spills  coffee on his table, and he doesn't seem to realize that it is supposed  to be a meet-cute moment because he is rude and ungracious in response.  In a later encounter, he tells her about his search for his grandfather  and her interest is piqued. To Effy, it's kind of like a detective  story, and she takes the lead: she knows that address on the envelope,  she wants them to go check it out together. Effy is intelligent, resourceful, and seems to have unlimited amounts of  time to wander around Copenhagen with this rude American man, tracking  down leads. At first it seems that Effy will be forced to take on the  burden of having to be the now-predictable Manic Pixie Dream Girl: \"the  one\" whose only purpose in life is to lighten up the gloomy male lead.  She has a pink plastic camera and is impulsive to the point of  recklessness. But Effy, like  William, does not quite fit into the genre requirements. She starts to  emerge as an individual. Much of this is due to the grounded performance  from Hansen. She suggests that Effy is not complete yet. She's still in  formation, acting a role a little bit, as young girls sometimes do. There's a beautiful and strange scene where Effy takes William into one  of the museums in Copenhagen. She wants to show him something. It's a  bust from ancient times, a female, and she moves to stand right next to  it, her silhouette and the bust's silhouette highlighted by the thin  white stream of light coming in from the window. Mark Raso allows that  image of the two heads side by side to just sit there for a long time,  still and silent. As the image settles, it becomes clear that Effy and  the bust are practically identical twins. Effy whispers, \"I've never  shown this to anyone.\" William runs his fingers over the bust's face, in  wonder at the resemblance. There's an eroticism in the moment,  problematic and uncomfortable due to the age discrepancy. Advertisement What is so beautiful about that scene, though, is that it is beyond  meaning. The image onscreen is what is important, and what it might mean  is up for grabs. It makes Effy's inner life a place of mystery and  power. She has gone to this museum a lot to visit her doppelg\u00e4nger. She  has wondered about that woman in ancient Greece or Rome, wondered at the  connection. She feels in touch with something eternal in herself. None  of this is stated explicitly but it pulses off the screen. What one may expect to happen does not exactly go down as planned.  \"Copenhagen\" remains true to its own original and somewhat prickly  course. There are moments when it is not clear at all why Effy is even  choosing to hang out with William, who is rude and combative (in moments  big and small). But she wants to know what happened to William's  grandfather. Over the course of the film an interesting thing starts  happening. William starts to take responsibility for the words he uses.  He starts to actually listen to himself and do his best to change  course. A lifetime of being a rude rage-boy will not vanish overnight,  and a lesser film would have made it Effy's job to show him the better  way. But \"Copenhagen\" isn't really about that. Nobody can save you. You  have to save yourself. Talented cinematographer Alan Poon gives us dreamy beautiful shots of  the city, its buildings, canals, cobblestone alleyways, crowded  nightclubs. His work helps ground the film. \"Copenhagen\" knows life is  complex, and knows that most of us are messes most of the time.  Hopefully we all do our best and try not to hurt one another; try to be  kind. William doesn't quite get that, not yet, because he's too self-righteous  and pissed off. But the film is, in many ways, his lurching journey  towards starting to understand that his character is up to him and him  alone."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Maze Runner", "Review": "Stop me if you think you\u2019ve heard this one before: In a\r\nrigidly structured dystopian future, one plucky teenager dares to think for\r\nhimself, shake up the status quo and start a revolution\u2013or, at least the\r\nbeginning of a trilogy. Such is the stuff of \u201cThe Maze Runner,\u201d which hews pretty\r\nclosely to the YA-novel formula that\u2019s reliably produced so many hugely\r\nsuccessful film adaptations in recent years. And, indeed, director Wes Ball\u2019s\r\nfilm is based on the best seller by James Dashner. It features a similar structure, hits some recognizable beats and includes some\r\ncharacter types that will seem pretty familiar to anyone who\u2019s seen the \u201cHunger\r\nGames\u201d films, or \u201cDivergent,\u201d or \u201cThe Giver.\u201d  Advertisement But its roots stretch back further to classic, allegorical\r\nliterature about frightening utopias, especially \u201cLord of the Flies.\u201d While\r\nthere\u2019s no Piggy and no conch, the teenage boys who populate this eerily\r\nidyllic society have formed their own leadership and their own rules, and they\r\nthink they\u2019ve achieved a peaceful sense of order. That is, until Thomas shows up. Actually, he doesn\u2019t even\r\nknow his name is Thomas at first. Dylan O\u2019Brien (MTV\u2019s \u201cTeen Wolf\u201d), who\r\nresembles a young Rob Lowe, plays the confused young man. At the film\u2019s start,\r\nhe finds himself rising quickly in a big, rickety freight elevator that\u2019s also\r\nloaded with supplies. (The film\u2019s sound design is quite startling and\r\neffective; it puts you on edge from the earliest moments.) When he arrives at the top, he steps out into a sprawling,\r\ngrassy square known as the Glade, which is surrounded on all sides by imposing\r\nand impossibly high concrete walls. Dozens of handsome, young men of various\r\nethnicities wearing various shades of the same long-sleeved shirt work together\r\ncooperatively in the sunshine\u2013building huts, gardening, cooking, etc. It\u2019s\r\nlike the world\u2019s hottest, grungiest Benetton ad. Like the others before him, Thomas has no memory of who he\r\nis and no idea how he got there. But as the newest arrival to the Glade, he is\r\ndubbed a \u201cgreenie\u201d and duly hazed until he can prove his worth to the key\r\nfigures he meets. The charismatic Alby (Aml Ameen), who was the first to\r\narrive, is the de facto leader. Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) is his impish\r\nright-hand man. Gally (Will Poulter) is the muscular bully. Chuck (Blake\r\nCooper) is the wisecracking chubby kid. And Minho (Ki Hong Lee) is the head of the runners:\r\nfleet-footed boys who dare to enter an opening in the giant walls and explore\r\nthe maze that lies behind them. It\u2019s vast and treacherous but at least\r\nnavigable in the daytime; at night, it closes up, changes paths and devours\r\nanyone foolish enough to remain trapped. No one has survived it overnight and\r\nno one has exited the other side. Naturally, Thomas is intrigued. And what\u2019s intriguing about \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d\u2013for a long\r\ntime, at least\u2013is the way it tells us a story we think we\u2019ve heard countless\r\ntimes before but with a refreshingly different tone and degree of detail. Ball, whose\r\nbackground is in visual effects, doesn\u2019t overload his feature debut with a lot\r\nof glossy, high-tech imagery. Not for a while, anyway. Much of the film\u2019s charm\r\ncomes from its rough-hewn aesthetic\u2013a tactile nature that\u2019s both industrial\r\nand organic\u2013and the way it takes its time vividly establishing an environment. Advertisement When Thomas eventually does enter the maze\u2013no spoiler\r\nthere, folks, it\u2019s in the title\u2013it produces some moments that are truly\r\nharrowing and filled with non-stop, near-death peril. (This is a super-violent\r\nPG-13, but then again, the young readers who are the target for these books\r\nknow what\u2019s in store for them.) The beasts who dwell there are incessant,\r\nravenous and very, very fast. I won\u2019t divulge what they are, but I\u2019ll only say\r\nthat they\u2019re extremely cool looking and scary as hell. All of which brings us to the ending. Man, that ending. What\r\na misstep. It\u2019s so incredibly frustrating, because everything was going so well\r\nuntil then. The third act brings some mystery with the arrival of the first\r\ngirl ever sent up in the elevator: a strong-willed brunette named Teresa (Kaya\r\nScodelario), who seems to know Thomas already.  But The Big Reveal of what happened to these kids, who\r\ntrapped them in this place and what their purpose is ends up being pretty over-the-top\r\neven for sci-fi. A lot happens in the film\u2019s final minutes to the extent that\r\nit makes \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d feel like it has several conclusions. Some of them\r\nfeature some unintentional hilarity when shock and fear probably were in the\r\ngame plan. And they squander the formidable and versatile Patricia Clarkson in\r\nonly a few moments as the chilly, nefarious mastermind of the maze. Presumably, she\u2019ll figure more prominently in the sequel.\r\nBecause, oh yes, it\u2019s coming. You will not have to wander around looking for it\r\nfor long."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Evening", "Review": "There are few things more depressing than a weeper that doesn't make you weep. \"Evening\" creeps through its dolorous paces as prudently as an undertaker. Upstairs, in the big newport mansion, a woman is dying in a Martha Stewart bedroom. She takes a very long time to die, because the whole movie consists of flashbacks from her reveries. This gives us time to reflect on deep issues, such as, who is this woman? Everybody in the film knows her, and eventually we figure out that she is Ann (Vanessa Redgrave), once the young sprite played in the flashbacks by Claire Danes. I know I must be abnormally obtuse to be confused on this question, but I persisted in thinking she might be the aged form of Lila, who as a young girl (Mamie Gummer), is getting married as the movie opens (it opens in a flashback, then flashes forward to the bed where it is flashing back from). How could I make such a stupid error? Because the mansion she is dying in looks like the same mansion Lila was married from, so I assumed old Lila was still living there. Maybe it's a different mansion. Real estate confuses me. Advertisement There are two grown daughters hanging around at the bedside: Constance (Natasha Richardson) and Nina (Toni Collette). But you can't figure out who they are from the flashbacks, because neither has been born yet. However, the flashbacks devote a great deal of time to examining how Lila has had a crush on Harris (Patrick Wilson), a young doctor and wedding guest whose mother was the family's housekeeper. Lila's brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) also has had a lifelong crush on Harris, but his love dare not speak its name. Ann is Lila's best friend and maid of honor, and she also falls in love with Harris. Lila is scheduled to be married on the morrow to the kind of a bore who (I'm only guessing) would be happy as the corresponding secretary of his fraternity. She does not love him, she loves Harris. I already said that. But what makes this Harris so electrifying? Search me. If he is warm, witty and wonderful on the inside, those qualities are well-concealed by his exterior, which resembles a good job of aluminum siding: It is unbending and resists the elements. Oh, but I forgot: Harris has one ability defined in my Little Movie Glossary: He is a Seeing-Eye Man. Such men are gifted at pointing out things to women. Man sees, points, woman turns, and now she sees, too, and smiles gratefully. Harris is a very highly evolved Seeing-Eye Man. Not once but twice he looks at the heavens and sees a twinkling star. \"That's our star,\" he says, or words to that effect. \"See it there?\" He points. Young Ann looks up at the billions and billions of stars, sees their star and nods gratefully. Director Lajos Koltai cuts to the sky, and we see it, too. Or one just like it. In the upstairs bedroom, old Ann dies very slowly, remembering the events of the long-ago wedding night and the next morning. Out of consideration for us, her reveries are in chronological order, even including events at which she was not present, like before she arrived at the house. She is attended by a nurse with an Irish accent (Eileen Atkins), who sometimes prompts her: \"Remember a happy time!\" Dissolve to Ann's memory of a happy time. It is so mundane that if it qualifies as a high point in her life, it compares with Paris Hilton remembering a good stick of gum. Advertisement What horrors have I overlooked? Oh, the Plunge. Family tradition at weddings requires all male guests to plunge from a high rock into the sea. This inevitably leads to shots of the barren ocean and cries of \"Buddy? Buddy?\" But I'm not giving anything away, because Buddy is good for no end of cries of \"Buddy?\" in this movie. At one point, he needs a doctor, and they remember that Harris is a doctor, and start shouting, \"Harris! Harris!\" in the forest, having absolutely no reason to suppose Harris is within earshot. Buddy inevitably is an alcoholic whose family members are forever moving the wine bottle out of his reach. He has to get drunk as an excuse to kiss Harris. This is pathetic. Buddy should grow up, bite the bullet and learn that it takes no excuse to get drunk. Later on, women in the flashbacks get pregnant and deliver the children who will puzzle us in the flash-forwards, and there is one of those poignant chance encounters in Manhattan in the rain, where two old lovers meet after many years and have hardly anything to say. You know the kind of poignant encounter I'm thinking of. All too well, I imagine."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Shanghai", "Review": "After awkwardly collecting dust in the Weinstein attic for at least five years, Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m\u2019s \u201cShanghai\u201d is finally getting released. This pre-WWII noir, released in China in 2010 before going MIA until this weekend, cannot blame time for any of its flaws, no matter the year. Even if an uncredited editor were hired to make clear sense of these pieces, the film wouldn\u2019t work. Like a ball of Christmas lights dumped on our laps by Uncle Harvey (Weinstein) after missing for years, the knotted and frustrating \u201cShanghai\u201d is now out for audiences to dare to untangle, if that sounds fun.\u00a0 Advertisement John Cusack plays Paul Soames, an American spy who comes to Shanghai in October 1941, pretending to be a Nazi-sympathizing reporter for the Shanghai Herald, planning to meet up with his fellow spy friend Conner (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). However, Conner is killed one night while seeing a mysterious woman named Sumiko (Rinko Kikuchi), causing Paul to seek out who committed the murder (even though it could have been anyone, considering the murder is more like a protocol hit than a casual kill). While attending a party in the German sector of the city with his Nazi friends, he meets a Japanese general named Tanaka (Ken Watanabe) and a Triad boss in very good graces with the Japanese, Anthony Lan-Ting (Chow Yun-Fat), husband of a woman that Paul actually randomly flirted with the night before, Anna Lan-Ting (Gong Li). Anna secretly works with the Chinese Resistance against soon-to-be-invading Japan, and is present during brutal attacks on Japanese officials. Nonetheless, Paul thinks that if he can find Sumiko, then he can solve Conner\u2019s murder. At the same point, Paul\u2019s personal investigation intersects with his growing interest in Anna, which then leads Paul to learn about a Japanese warship, missing from port in the late fall of 1941.\u00a0 \u201cShanghai\u201d is clearly inspired by the likes of \u201cCasablanca,\u201d but its execution with archetypes and pulp is of a greedier, lazier, modern breed, propelled by the desire to always have \"something big\" happen, whether that means twisting a character beyond their believable limit or relying on happenstance. Eventually, everyone in \u201cShanghai\u201d seems to be some sort of spy \"just because,\" and Cusack\u2019s lead snoop has only made progress from a single murder to a World War with very dumb luck.\u00a0 H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m\u2019s film\u00a0is also at odds with its own emotional desires. It wants to be a type of political statement about the widespread damage of war, and how one life means nothing in the hardened environment. Many scenes of violence conclude with police photograph-like snaps of dead bodies, belonging to characters we barely know, but the brutality is meant to be scarring enough. But simultaneously, the film focuses on Paul's tedious obsession with a single person, the missing Sumiko, despite the much bigger picture of its international boiling points. By \"Shanghai's\" end, for a film that ends on the day that Pearl Harbor is attacked, there's a baffling lack of immediacy to such threat of doom.\u00a0 Cusack's involvement here is like the whole \"Shanghai\" package\u2014sometimes inspired, but in other ways unnatural in its forceful genre desires, without the sharpness to back it up. The inherent neuroses that he brings to a wide variety of movies, from comedy (\"High Fidelity\") to horror (\"Identity\"), is a welcome touch for a spy character, especially within politically intense conditions. When Paul watches a man be executed, his gaze of shock feels genuine; the same anxiety resonates when he is jokingly threatened by triad Anthony for possibly flirting with his wife. And it's worth saying that his vocal tone even works for the genre voice-over, giving juice to pulpy dialogue such as: \u201cLaughing at their jokes is like eating breakfast from the gutter.\u201d But, like the film, Cusack's Paul doesn't become a complete package, as these nerves don't match with other instances in which this Navy spy effortlessly caps a few no-name bad guys with the reflexes of a Connery-era James Bond. As the story of \u201cShanghai\u201d gets progressively out of control, so does Paul become an ambitious fictional being out of the narrative\u2019s grasp. Advertisement There are bigger, more reliable heavyweights in this production, but their charisma is stuck in the genre muck. Gong Li is put to a great amount of work as the most active member in the ensemble, but she has scant character aside from his intricate allegiances. As with Li and others, the inclusion of these big names makes for crowd-pleasing appearances at most: Chow Yun-Fat speaks with his big smile, and has an action moment or two that will recall \u201cThe Killer.\u201d Meanwhile, Ken Watanabe uses his masterful, intimidating presence to simply sneer through the movie, unable to create a full character by the time \u201cShanghai\u201d changes its spotlight to him.\u00a0 \u201cShanghai\u201d yearns to be a contemporary action movie, but in a different period and with an overeager amount of twists instead of bullets. Klaus Badlet\u2019s thundering score distances from the \u201840s period and tries to achieve the same ebbs and flows of the audience\u2019s attention as a \u201cTaken\u201d movie soundtrack.\u00a0H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m\u2019s noir vision does have some slick atmosphere, including some great things to look at, but it has very little to grab onto, never mind take out of the theater, other than a headache."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Exit Through the Gift Shop", "Review": "The widespread speculation that \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop\u201d is a hoax only adds to its fascination. An anonymous London graffiti artist named Banksy arrives to paint walls in Los Angeles. He encounters an obscure Frenchman named Thierry Guetta, who has dedicated his life to videotaping graffiti artists. The Frenchman's hundreds of tapes have been dumped unorganized into boxes. Banksy thinks they might make a film. Guetta makes a very bad one. Banksy takes over the film and advises Guetta to create some art himself. Guetta does, names himself Mr. Brainwash, and organizes an exhibition of his work through which he makes a fortune in sales. Advertisement Surely Guetta cannot be real? With his dashing mustache and Inspector Clouseau accent, his long-suffering wife and his zealous risk-taking to film illegal artists by stealth? Surely he didn't rent a former CBS television studio and transform it into an exhibition space? Surely people didn't line up at dawn to get in \u2014 and pay tens of thousands of dollars for the works of an artist who had never held a show, sold a work or received a review? Surely not if his work looked like art school ripoffs of the familiar styles of famous artists? Even while I sat spellbound during this film, that's what I was asking myself. But Thierry Guetta surely did. His art exhibition was written up in a cover story in L.A. Weekly on June 12, 2008. It mentions this film, which Banksy was \u201cthreatening to do.\u201d Common sense dictates that no one would rent a CBS studio and fill it with hundreds of art works in order to produce a hoax indie documentary. Nor would they cast Guetta, indubitably a real person, as himself. Right? Right? The film depends entirely on Guetta, a combination TV pitchman, a cartoon Frenchman and a chatty con man. Its footage really has been edited from a decade of tapes made clandestinely while L.A. graffiti artists risked arrest and death to create their paintings in spectacular places. Guetta fearlessly followed them right out into ledges and helped them carry supplies to places a human fly might balk at. All the time he's talking, talking, telling his life story and of his hero worship for these artists. There are all kinds of graffiti. Much of it is ugly defacement, the kind of territorial marking a dog does so much more elegantly. That's why Mayor Daley's Graffiti Busters have my support and admiration. Some graffiti, however, is certainly art, as Norman Mailer was one of the first to argue in his book The Faith of Graffiti (1974). Banksy and others at his level, such as Guetta's hero, Shepard Fairey, find ways to visually reinvent public spaces and make striking artistic statements. But what does Guetta do? One of his artworks, inspired by Andy Warhol's Campbell's soup can, shows a can of tomato spray paint. OK, that's witty enough for a nice editorial cartoon. How many thousands would you spend to have it in your house? Or a morph of Joan Crawford and Andy's Marilyn? Then again, at the time people said Andy Warhol wasn't creating art, either. Surely Warhol's message was that Thierry Guetta has an absolute right to call his work art, and sell it for as much as he can. Advertisement There are currently more than 3,600 comments on my recent blog post headlined \u201cVideo Games Can Never Be Art.\u201d At least 95 percent of them inform me I am a fool, and that \u201cart is in the eye of the beholder.\u201d I believe video games are not an art form, for reasons I am certainly not going to bring up again. I am quite willing to agree that graffiti is Art, but I don't believe the act of painting them is an art form, if you see what I mean. Or maybe you don't. You may be too old to understand my argument. Anyway, comment No. 3,307 on my blog was from Kristian, and it said, \u201cThe wafting smell of dried mung beans pervades my nostrils.\u201d That's kind of ... poetic, don't you think? But I stray from my thoughts, which are (1) \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop\u201d is an admirable and entertaining documentary; (2) I believe it is not a hoax; (3) I would not much want a Thierry Guetta original; (4) I like Thierry Guetta, and (5) Banksy, the creator of this film, is a gifted filmmaker whose thoughts, as he regards Guetta, must resemble those of Victor Frankenstein when he regarded his monster: It works, but is it Art?"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Into the Forest", "Review": "Over the years, I have found that quiet post-apocalyptic scenarios, which focus more on characters trying\r\nto survive in their new circumstances, are usually more interesting than those interested in hardware and spectacle. I'm thinking about films like\r\n\u201cTestament\u201d (1983), a powerful drama in which Jane Alexander played a suburban\r\nmom trying to keep her family together in the wake of a nuclear attack; \u201cMiracle Mile\u201d (1988), a wonderful thriller about a man who inadvertently\r\nreceives a phone call claiming that a nuclear war has been launched and his\r\ncity will be hit in just over an hour; and \u201cSeeking a Friend for the End of the\r\nWorld\u201d (2012), a quirky and sadly underrated comedy-drama about people dealing\r\nwith love and loss in the last few days before an asteroid hits Earth and\r\ndestroys all life. The similarly low-key Canadian import \u201cInto the Forest\u201d may\r\nnot quite hit the heights of those examples, but this story of a pair of\r\nmismatched sisters forced to face the unthinkable is, at least for most of its\r\nrunning time, a strong, smart and moving end-of-the-world drama that is further\r\nbolstered by strong performances from co-stars Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood. Advertisement Based on a novel by Jean Hegland and set in the not-too-distant\r\nfuture, the film introduces us to Nell (Page) and Eva (Wood), two sisters\r\nliving in a house hidden away in the woods of Northern\r\nCalifornia with their recently widowed father (Callum Keith Rennie). Although\r\nthe distance from the nearest town inspires them to keep plenty of provisions\r\non hand, the sisters are hardly the survivalist type\u2014Nell is online all the\r\ntime studying for her exams while Eva is relentlessly preparing for an upcoming\r\ndance recital. All of that changes one day when the power mysteriously goes\r\nout. At first, this seems to be just a minor annoyance, but not only does it\r\nnever come back on, there is talk that the entire country\u2014possibly even the\r\nworld\u2014is still in the dark. Although the loss of power puts a crimp in their\r\nimmediate plans, Nell and Eva are in a slightly better position than others in\r\nthe area\u2014as we realize during a creepy visit to the nearby town for what\r\nprovisions still remain\u2014thanks to the resourcefulness of their father. When that lifeline is soon cruelly cut off, the two are\r\nforced to face an uncertain future in which they have to figure out how to\r\nsurvive on their own. They face\r\ndangers ranging from starvation to illness to inhumanity within other people.\u00a0 \u201cInto the Forest\u201d was written and directed by Canadian filmmaker\r\nPatricia Rozema, whose previous efforts have included the charming comedy-drama\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve Heard the Mermaids Singing\u201d and a very good adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s\r\n\u201cMansfield Park.\u201d Instead of framing the story as an us-against-them narrative\r\nwith the sisters coming together to fight off the outside dangers, Rozema is\r\nmore interested in watching two people who have little in common beyond shared\r\ngenetic material trying to coexist at a time when even the smallest\r\nand most seemingly innocuous things\u2014a visit from Nell\u2019s boyfriend (Max\r\nMinghella), watching a home movie with a generator that uses precious gasoline\r\nor a hoarded piece of candy\u2014can have serious consequences. Instead\r\nof making Nell and Eva into instant saints, she allows them to have the moments\r\nof anger, prickliness and selfishness that any of us would most likely succumb\r\nto given the circumstances. While all of this is going on,\r\nshe also creates a quiet but palpable sense of menace regarding the world\r\noutside the house, where even the slightest odd noise can be the harbinger of\r\nsome potential horror from which they cannot easily escape. Adding to the power of the story are the performances from Page\r\nand Wood. At first glance, the casting might seem to be a bit questionable\u2014both\r\nactresses are clearly a few crucial years older than the characters they're playing and they don\u2019t exactly look much like sisters, either. And yet, while\r\nthey may not resemble siblings that much, that aspect is quickly forgotten\r\nbecause of how deftly they create the idea of long-standing family\r\nties\u2014the kind that occasionally choke as well as bind, and find themselves\r\nbeing both tested and strengthened under extreme circumstances. At first, the\r\ntwo are clearly playing to their strengths\u2014Page is the more outwardly strong\r\nand pragmatic Nell while Wood is the dreamier and more ethereal Eva\u2014but as the\r\nstory progresses and circumstances change, they find new dimensions to the\r\ncharacters as well. Page brings an unexpected vulnerability to Nell without\r\nsacrificing her basic strength while Wood, in the best role she has had in\r\nquite a while, gives Eva the kind of nerve and determination one would\r\nhardly expect her to possess based on our initial glimpses of her. Callum Keith Rennie and Max Minghella are also good in their smaller roles, and there is another memorable\r\nsupporting turn from Michael Eklund as a local who figures in the film\u2019s most\r\nharrowing moment, one that Rozema thankfully does not milk for cheap thrills or\r\nempty heroics. Advertisement The one major problem with \u201cInto the Forest,\u201d the one that keeps\r\nit from making that final leap of good movie to a potentially great\r\none, is that the final third is just not quite as strong as the stuff that\r\nprecedes it. Rozema doesn\u2019t seem to have as sturdy of a grip on this\r\nsection, and while the ingredients are certainly there for a satisfying\r\nconclusion, they just don\u2019t quite come together in an entirely satisfying\r\nmanner. (Of course, one could argue that by giving viewers an uncertain\r\nconclusion, Rozema is attempting to put viewers in the footsteps of her\r\nprotagonists.) That problem aside, \u201cInto the Forest\u201d is an undeniably interesting,\r\noftentimes affecting and, yes, unapologetically feminist take on the\r\npost-apocalyptic narrative.\u00a0Unfortunately, by coming out in the middle of the summer opposite blockbuster banalities like \u201cJason Bourne,\u201d there is a good chance it will come and go from theaters. But find a way to see \"Into the Forest,\" for it is the kind of film that will not only stick with you, it will even make you think."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Hacksaw Ridge", "Review": "\"Hacksaw Ridge,\" about a pacifist who won the Medal of Honor without firing a shot, is a mess. It makes hash of its plainly stated moral code by reveling in the same blood-lust it condemns. But it's also one of the few original action movies released in the last decade, and one of the only studio releases this year that could sincerely be described as a religious picture. Of course, it's directed by Mel Gibson, who rose to international stardom in R-rated action flicks and went on to become the true heir to Sam Peckinpah, directing a series of astoundingly violent films with cores of spirituality: \"Braveheart,\" \"The Passion of the Christ\" and \"Apocalypto.\" True to form, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" draws equally on Gibson's bottomless thirst for mayhem and his sincerely held religious beliefs\u2014or some of them, anyway. It's a movie at war with itself. Advertisement The first half lays out the childhood and adolescence of its hero, Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), a Seventh-day Adventist turned U.S. Army corporal. Set in Virginia hill country in the '20s and '30s, it's shot in the creamy hues of a Norman Rockwell painting, and filled with earnest, Old Hollywood-styled exchanges about violence and pacifism. The second half is set during the Battle of Okinawa, where Doss, who described himself as a \"conscientious collaborator\" rather than objector, rescued 75 fellow infantrymen injured by the Japanese; it feels like an attempt to one-up the D-Day sequence in \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and if sheer bloody explosive nastiness were the only measure, you'd have to declare \"Hacksaw Ridge\" the winner. The combat pays nearly as much attention to the rending, burning and perforating of flesh as it does to the hero's anguish and ingenuity. Gibson shows soldiers using mortar shells as homemade grenades (as in the climax of \"Saving Private Ryan\"), shifts into glorious slow-motion to showcase a soldier kicking an enemy's lobbed grenade away, and treats us to the surreal and inappropriately comic sight of Doss towing a paraplegic infantryman on a homemade sled while the man cuts down bushels of Japanese soldiers with a sub-machine gun.  This stuff feels like a violation of the spirit of Doss' moral code, if not its letter. But the first half, which channels the majestic squareness of a John Ford family drama, is weird, too. It's myth-making with a dash of self-help and Scripture, but Gibson keeps trying to jazz things up with violence or the threat of violence, even when the scenes don't seem to call for it. Familiar movie situations, such as Doss taking his future wife Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) out on a date or getting to know his bunk-mates, are interrupted by horror movie-style jump scares or fused to bits of black comic suspense (we know somebody's going to get maimed by the knife that a soldier is brandishing when Doss enters the barracks; the only questions are which one and when). This is the directorial equivalent of Gibson the actor working Three  Stooges shtick into otherwise straightforward dialogue scenes\u2014either a nervous tic or a compulsion. The wide shots of corpses piled up, the shots of Doss posed like Christ or lit by heavenly sunlight streaming through windows, and the moments when Doss treats enemy soldiers with compassion, are a lot more on-message.  All that said, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" seems aware of its inability to present  the horrors of war in a consistently non-thrilling, non-cool way. There are  even moments where the film seems ashamed that it can't live up to Doss' example\u2014particularly when other characters question Doss' belief that  violence is never justified and that there is no real distinction between killing  and murder. What you see on other characters' faces in these scenes is not contempt but incredulity, followed by petulance and finally denial. They can feel the truth of what Doss is saying. But they can't imagine the world being anything other than what it is, a place ruled by brute force and cruelty. The rifles that Doss refuses to pick up are described as girls, women, mates, \"perhaps the only thing in life you'll truly love.\" The other soldiers' crude sexual talk and casual sadism are contrasted with Doss' sweetness, piety and chastity. Doss' drill sergeant (Vince Vaughn, effectively typecast as a  charismatic bully) and other commanding officers keep pressuring Doss to  pick up a rifle. When he refuses,  they humiliate him and sign off on his hazing; his own platoon-mates call him \"coward\" and \"pussy.\" They don't want to break or kill Doss, just drive him from their sight, perhaps so they won't have to second-guess themselves each time they lay eyes on him. Advertisement It's worth pointing out here that Doss is the child of an alcoholic World War I veteran, Tom (Hugo Weaving). The film's own contradictions are embodied in Doss' dad. He preaches the virtues of nonviolence, rails against the romanticizing of war, visits the graves of childhood friends killed at the Battle of Belleau Wood, and doesn't want Doss or his older brother Hal (Nathaniel Buzolic) to enlist after Pearl Harbor. But he's also self-pitying, quick to anger, and beats his wife Bertha (Rachel Griffiths) and their sons. He wants to change and knows why he should. But he can't.  Tom Doss' drinking problem feels like more than just a biographical detail. The script, credited to Andrew Knight and playwright Robert Schenkkan  (\"All the Way\"), keeps returning to Tom. The hero's pacifism seems as  much a rejection of his dad's angry brokenness and inability to control  his temper as a reaction to almost killing his brother in a  childhood scuffle. Also of interest: like Sam Peckinpah, Gibson has struggled with alcoholism, he has bipolar disorder and rage issues as well, and as an artist he is addicted to violence. In its more thoughtful moments, the film treats intoxication with violence, both real and fictional, as a species-wide addiction\u2014one that can't easily be broken. I'd be shocked if a director as attuned to mythic signifiers as Gibson weren't trying, in his own fumbling way, to explore this idea. Too bad action-film awesomeness is the intoxicant that \"Hacksaw Ridge\" can't quit. You feel the movie fighting to suppress its urge to glorify violence and treat the Japanese as sinister hordes. Even in non-war scenes, it can't stop reaching for the bottle, and there's a wave of shame when it falls off the wagon. A lingering close-up of guts and goop is followed by a shot of the hero looking appalled or terrified, as if to rebuke the director's gifts.  \"Hacksaw Ridge\" seems to know that its hero is better than anyone around him, perhaps better than the movie that tells his story. This comes through strongly in the relationship between Doss and fellow infantryman Smitty (Luke Bracey), a far more convincing love story than the one between Doss and his gal. Of course Smitty loathes and torments Doss, then comes to respect and even revere him. The way Smitty looks at Doss during the battle of Okinawa recalls the way the disciples gazed upon Jesus in Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\"\u2014as a promise and a mystery; a person so strikingly different from other people, so fully formed, so serenely and undeniably good, that he seems more angel than man. Garfield's performance humanizes him. For a long time you think Doss is an idealized figure, free of neuroses and complications. But after a while you see the darkness in him, and you believe it exists because of the thoughtful way Garfield has prepared you.\u00a0  This film is inept and beautiful, stupid and amazing. It doesn't have the words or images to express how deep it is. That's why it's more interesting to talk about than it is to watch. I wonder what the real Doss, who died in 2006, would have thought of it.  Advertisement"}

Catchy tune. That this\r\nmovie should use a variation on its title strikes me as false advertising. A\r\nbetter name for this movie would maybe be \u201cThe Ghastly Ones.\u201d Directed by Saverio Costanzo, the movie operates at a much\r\nhigher level of craft than the Andy Milligan cheapie horror picture from which\r\nI lifted my suggested title. But it is an equally painful cinematic experience,\r\nand it is painful in a completely unrewarding way. It is earnest and tortured\r\nand pointless, in a very self-serious suffer-for/with-art fashion.

Advertisement Because Mina and Jude then move into a dreary walk-up on the\r\nUpper West Side of Manhattan, just a few blocks from the Dakota, some folks\r\nwho\u2019ve written about this film have likened it to \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby.\u201d This is\r\noff-base for several reasons, not the least of which is that you kind of like\r\npoor Rosemary in that movie. No, what \u201cHungry Hearts\u201d most resembles is a\r\nnightmare enactment of \u201cKnocked Up\u201d: a couple that barely knows each other\r\ndecide to embark on child-rearing together. Mina\u2019s eccentricities in these\r\nmatters are hinted at when she enthusiastically informs Jude that a psychic has\r\ndeemed their yet-to-be-born baby an \u201cindigo child\u201d (it\u2019s kinda like when a\r\npsychic tells you, a person who has already been born, that you have a \u201cblue\u201d\r\naura). Seems harmless enough. Only once the baby\u2019s born, Mina puts it on a\r\nweird vegan regimen.

The movie opens with Jesus (H\u00e9ctor Medina), a thin and\r\ndelicately-featured young man, styling the hair of an old woman. His apartment\r\nis run-down but sturdy, with a small balcony; the presence of Jesus\u2019 busybody\r\nclient and his sassy female pal Cecilia (Laura Alem\u00e1n) give it a cozy feel in\r\nspite of its grubbiness. In this teeming slum, money\u2019s too tight to mention, as\r\nis space. After Jesus is done with the old lady\u2019s hair, she partially stiffs\r\nhim on the fee, and Cecilia inveigles Jesus into letting her use his apartment\r\nfor a hookup session with her boyfriend Javier (Oscar Ibarra Napoles), an up-and-coming boxer. Jesus\r\nwanders the street, considering his options. Before arriving at the drag club\r\nwhere he tends the wigs of the ruler of its roost, aptly named \u201cMama\u201d (Luis\r\nAlberto Garc\u00eda), Jesus wanders past a park where male prostitutes solicit\r\n(mostly) tourists.  Advertisement Jesus would prefer to perform, although he\u2019s got no\r\nexperience in drag. He picks an outfit, gives himself a performing\r\nname (\"Viva\"), and brings some vintage Cuban vinyl to spin for his audition. For his\r\ntroubles, he gets called \u201cGodzilla\u201d by the other drag performers, none of whom,\r\ntruth to tell, are within swinging distance of \u201cpassing.\u201d No matter. Mama\r\nintuits the choices Jesus is facing and gives him a slot. One evening, a burly,\r\nbearded drunk to whom Viva is directing her romantic lip-syncing punches her\r\nin the mouth.  Jesus\u2019\r\nfather Angel (longtime Cuban star Jorge Perugorr\u00eda) is a\u00a0one-time boxer who had been serving a prison sentence for\r\nkilling a man in a brawl almost 20 years before. He is also a big homophobe. So there\u2019s the central\r\nconflict, and if you\u2019re thinking that the rest of the film concerns itself with\r\nthe way these two find understanding and reconciliation, well, ding\u00a0ding ding as the sound effect on some game shows goes.  Neither character talks all that much, but both actors project\r\ncomplex intelligence and consistent emotional acuity. As Angel, Perugorr\u00eda brings a strong, downtrodden machismo vibe, with intimations of Aldo Ray and/or Russell Crowe gone to seed; Medina\u2019s Jesus is also vivid.\u00a0They, and other cast\r\nmembers, make the movie more moving than it might otherwise have a right to be.\r\nWhile director Paddy Breathnach shoots in a widescreen format without often\r\nhaving much of an idea what to do with it (and goes wobbly-handheld far too\r\noften, possibly in thrall to the fallacy that shaky camerawork enhances\r\nrealism), every now and then he hits on a composition that yields a powerful\r\ndepiction of Havana.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Dogtooth", "Review": "\"Dogtooth\u201d is a bizarre fantasy that takes the concept of home schooling to squirmy extremes. Some home schoolers try to limit what their children can learn, and others attempt to broaden it. The parents in \u201cDogtooth\u201d have passed far beyond such categories, into the realms of home psychopathology. No name is given for the family or any of its members. These involve a father, a mother, a brother and two sisters. They live in a large, affluent home behind a very high wall and a gate, which is always locked. Only the father ever leaves, driving to the factory he owns.  Advertisement The others are prisoners, the mother apparently by choice. There is a large lawn and a swimming pool. The television set is used only to watch the family's home videos. The children have no idea of the outside world, where they are told man-eating cats roam. On the other side of the wall, they believe another brother lives, who they've never seen or heard. Man-eating cats? Who knows? The film, which won the Un Certain Regard section at Cannes 2009, begins with a tape-recorded language lesson in which they're taught the wrong words for things. \u201cSea,\u201d for example, is the word for the big leather armchair in the living room. Father is a stern taskmaster, free with stern reprimands and a hard slap or two. He also teaches all of his family members to get down on all fours and bark like dogs. He and Mother seem in complete agreement about their child-rearing methods, but never discuss them in detail. The son is about 20, the daughters in their teens. To slake the boy's sexual needs, Father brings home a security guard from his factory, who has sex with the son with all the spontaneity and joy of tooth removal. This woman also trades a daughter some cheap jewelry in trade for some illicit licking. The kids are so innocent, they decide that it's much the same no matter where you lick, and trade favors for licking legs, elbows and ears. Sex seems to have no meaning, not even when incest is suggested. The sickness of this family surpasses all understanding, and some have even described the film as a comedy. I wasn't laughing. All I can say of the ending is that it is certainly a possible outcome of the film, and gets much more than you would think out of a shot of the family car. There is this. \u201cDogtooth\u201d is like a car crash. You cannot look away. The Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos tells his story with complete command of visuals and performances. His cinematography is like a series of family photographs of a family with something wrong with it. His dialogue sounds composed entirely of sentences memorized from tourist phrase books. The message I took away was: God help children whose parents insanely demand unquestioning obedience to their deranged standards."}
{"Stars": 0.5, "Title": "The Do-Over", "Review": "Steven Brill\u2019s \u201cThe Do-Over,\u201d the latest in a multi-picture\r\ndeal between Netflix and Adam Sandler, starts like a real movie. At first,\r\nthere\u2019s a sense that it\u2019s something at least greater than the half-star abomination\r\nthat was last year\u2019s \u201cThe Ridiculous Six.\u201d This feeling doesn\u2019t last long. By\r\nthe time this unfunny, sexist, homophobic, stupid movie has reached the hour\r\npoint, any goodwill created by the set-up is long gone. At one point, I checked\r\nthe time code on Netflix and saw that the movie had over forty minutes to go. I\r\nvisibly winced. Advertisement The set-up is OK (at least when compared to the\r\nincreasing laziness of Sandler\u2019s recent output). Sandler plays Max, a\r\nsmooth-talking guy who runs into an old friend named Charlie (David Spade) at a\r\nreunion. Charlie\u2019s life is a mess. His wife Nikki (Natasha Leggero) is sleeping\r\naround (with Sean Astin), his kids hate him, and he\u2019s just generally\r\nmiserable. Reuniting with Max turns him into a goofy teenager again, having fun\r\nand avoiding his depressing reality. When Max decides to fake their deaths so\r\nthey can start over in Puerto Rico, Charlie doesn\u2019t object for long. Of course,\r\nthey can\u2019t party it up in their new identities for long without the need for a\r\nconvoluted Happy Madison plot, and that\u2019s when armed men show up and they get\r\ninvolved with the widow (Paula Patton) of one of the men whose identities they\r\nstole. Narratively, it\u2019s a film that gets markedly dumber with every passing\r\nminute. \u201cThe Do-Over\u201d is the kind of film in which two essentially\r\n50-year-old men (Spade is 52 and Sandler is 49) are riding around on a yacht\r\nwhen they spot a few bikini-clad ladies on another vessel. If you\u2019re playing\r\nSandler Mad Libs at home, you instantly know that Adam is going to ask the\r\nwomen to flash them. They oblige, but then ask Spade\u2019s character to return the\r\nfavor by dropping his trousers, after which they laugh at his dick. Sandler\r\nthen shoots the women with a flare gun. And the cherry on this Bad Scene Sundae\r\ncomes with the following in voiceover, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I was having the\r\nbest time of my adult life.\u201d It\u2019s one of only about three times I laughed out\r\nloud while watching \u201cThe Do-Over,\u201d but not for the reasons Sandler wanted. I use this example not just to point out the incredibly low\r\nlevel of humor in \u201cThe Do-Over,\u201d but to note how structurally, tonally\r\ndisastrous the whole thing is. Like that scene, almost every moment has multiple\r\npunchlines. Charlie and Max decide they have to get tattoos and piercings to\r\nmatch the dead guys. Charlie finds a stud, thinks it\u2019s for his ear, and then\r\nlearns it\u2019s for his tongue. That\u2019s the joke. Then we get a wide-eyed shot of it\r\ngoing in. Then we get the swollen tongue the next day. Then we get a scene of\r\nhim eating a popsicle, unable to talk. Imagine a stand-up comedian who just\r\npiles on to one lame joke after another, repeating the punchline with a few\r\nwords changed. The rhythm isn\u2019t there. It feels desperate, almost as if the\r\ndeal that Sandler worked out with Netflix required that he be paid by the\r\nminute. How else to explain the fact that this film is 108 minutes long? (And\r\nit feels twice as long as that.) Advertisement There are really brief spots that work, most of them\r\ncourtesy of the fearless Kathryn Hahn, who shows up as Max\u2019s crazy ex. Hahn has\r\nthe comic timing to make nearly anything work, even this disaster. I wish I could\r\nhave followed her into a better movie. Although her arrival is right around\r\nwhen most people will realize how sexist this whole thing is. Almost every\r\nfemale character is there to be screwed or to screw the guys over. Or both.\r\nThis is how Sandler\u2019s brand has always portrayed their female characters, but\r\nit\u2019s just increasingly depressing. When the climax of the film features a\r\ncatfight set to Madonna\u2019s \u201cCrazy For You,\u201d in slow motion, I shouldn\u2019t be\r\nsurprised, but that doesn\u2019t make it any more forgivable. For years now, Adam Sandler has been making movies to\r\nbankroll his vacations. That\u2019s why most of \u201cJust Go With It\u201d takes place in\r\nHawaii. \u201cBlended\u201d actually shot in South Africa. Sandler gets his buddies\r\ntogether, finds a studio to pay for them all to take a vacation, and loosely \u201cwrites\u201d\r\na movie set in his chosen destination (screenwriting credit goes to Kevin Barnett and Chris Pappas). This time it was Puerto Rico, and\r\nSandler puts in the same degree of effort as his disastrous theatrical \u201cVacation\r\nComedies.\" You\u2019d think by now that someone would figure this out. Maybe the\r\nstudios did and that\u2019s why Sandler ran to the remarkably open checkbook of\r\nNetflix. Maybe one day, they\u2019ll read the script before they book the plane\r\ntickets. Or at least make sure he's got one."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Young Ones", "Review": "I don\u2019t want to come off like some kind of inverse snob, but\r\nI\u2019ve got to say, given the circumstances of his birth and upbringing,\r\nwriter-director Jake Paltrow strikes me as the Least Qualified Person To\r\nEnvision A Dystopian Sci-Fi Future Ever. You may infer the circumstances of\r\nPaltrow\u2019s birth and upbringing by his name, I reckon. In any event,\r\nqualifications notwithstanding, he has nevertheless opted to imagine and film\r\nsuch a story, one that bears out my hunch.  \u201cYoung Ones\u201d (there really isn\u2019t anything in the movie that\r\nmakes this bland title pop) takes place in an unnamed portion of the Western\r\nUnited States at a time when water is very scarce, and chronicles a sort of\r\nland-war-by-subterfuge in which the main players are Michael Shannon\u2019s haunted\r\npatriarch, Nicholas Hoult\u2019s ambitious young-man-on-the-make (for several items,\r\nincluding Elle Fanning\u2019s character, Shannon\u2019s daughter) and Kodi Smit-McPhee\u2019s\r\nobservant, sensitive son-of-Shannon. In Paltrow\u2019s future, water is a commodity\r\nnot unlike oil. But the former farmers of the now-desert in which Shannon\r\nroams, first with a live donkey, then with a robot replacement, are not nearly\r\nas stressed as ordinary mortals in danger of imminent dehydration might be in\r\nthe real world. Indeed, Paltrow\u2019s near-dystopia (there is still a central\r\ngovernment and a semblance of civilization, including used-car dealerships, in this\r\nworld) is one of the most decorous you\u2019ll ever see. Even the most thirsty and\r\ndesperate look pretty good most of the time. And the color coordination! At one\r\npoint, Aimee Mullins, playing a mom with a new robotic spinal cord, tunes into a\r\nvideo-streaming funeral, at which the attendees are all dressed in blue-grey\r\nclothes, the better to blend in with the blue-grey rock formation behind them.\r\nSeriously, this movie makes \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d look like \u201cThe Road Warrior.\u201d  Advertisement Paltrow, whose previous directorial feature was the somewhat\r\nmore apt 2007 showbiz romcom \u201cThe Good Night,\u201d is an attentive student of\r\ncinema, as his mini-homages to the likes of Antonioni and Lucas in this story\r\ntestify. But his story is a veritable nothingburger, here and there recalling notes\r\nfrom the likes of \u201cGiant\u201d and \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d but never really\r\nconnecting on levels emotional or intellectual. One would like to say the cast\r\ndoes its level best, but, to be brutally honest, the footage assembled doesn\u2019t\r\ndepict them doing a whole lot more than squinting, and looking lanky in clothes\r\nthat, again, aren\u2019t inordinately suitable for desert living, unless it\u2019s GQ\u2019s\r\nidea of desert living. Viewers who make it to the end will be confused or\r\ninfuriated but likely not delighted by the faux-Wes-Anderson curtain-call end\r\ncredits. Too bland to qualify as a really notable disaster, \u201cYoung Ones\u201d finds\r\nyoung Paltrow still trying to find his voice.

{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Christmas Candle", "Review": "\"The Christmas Candle\" is a determinedly retro-minded holiday saga that contains no foul language, gruesome violence indeed anything beyond the mildest suggestion of hanky-panky, and for a certain portion of the moviegoing public, these absences alone would be enough to warrant a recommendation. The trouble is that the filmmakers have also neglected to include such other elements as wit, style, energy or anything resembling a coherent narrative. The end result is the kind of vaguely distasteful Yuletide concoction that viewers normally find playing on cable channels that they don't even realize that they have. Advertisement Based on the book by Max Lucado, the film, set in 1890, begins as Reverend David Richmond (Hans Matheson), an idealistic man of God who has lost his faith, accepts a new position in Gladbury, a quaint little English town that appears to have been built from the remains of the sets from a road company of \"Oliver.\" Upon his arrival, he learns the town's odd secret. It seem that every 25 years during the Christmas season, an angel arrives at the local candle shop, owned by the Haddington family for generations, in order to bless one of their candles so that the eventual recipient will receive a miracle after saying a prayer and lighting the candle.  This strikes Rev. Richmond as utter nonsense and he tries to convert the townspeople from a candle-based form of faith to something more pragmatic by encouraging them to be miracles to each other via good deeds and simple acts of kindness. For a while, this progressive agenda seems to be doing the trick, but when Richmond tries to push his luck by installing some of those new-fangled electric lights in the church, the modern touch results in something more akin to Carrie's prom than the usual advent service. Throw in a mix-up involving the Christmas candle, and it appears that the hopes and prayers of all of Gladbury are doomed to go unheeded. After all, it would take a miracle for things to turn around, and what are the chances of that happening in a holiday-themed entertainment?  \"The Christmas Candle\" has received a bit of notoriety because it was produced by Echolight Studios, a concern whose CEO is none other than failed conservative presidential candidate and sweater-vest enthusiast Rick Santorum. Because of his presence behind the scenes, it is tempting to comb through the film for any possible references to his political agenda. For example, we are introduced early on to a spunky and modern-minded shopgirl (Samantha Barks, whom you will recall for being one of the only worthwhile elements of last year's monstrous adaptation of \"Les Miserables\") but before too long, she is reduced to her presumed proper position of spooning broth and gazing adoringly at Richmond. Another character is a spinster whose sole prayer is to find herself a husband in order to make her life complete. To make matters even more amusing, this particular character bears a passing resemblance to none other that Rachel Maddow.  Advertisement However, the reasons that the film doesn't work\u2014and it doesn't\u2014have less to do with politics and more to do with the fact that the story makes precious little sense even by holiday fable standards. The point of \"The Christmas Candle,\" I think, is to illustrate how the two versions of faith being depicted\u2014praying for miracles to happen and working to make them happen\u2014are not mutually exclusive and in fact work best when they work in tandem rather than at odds. And yet, the film seems to go to great pains to have both Richmond and the Haddingtons fail miserably in their various attempts until (Spoiler Alert!) a miracle or two arrives out of nowhere to put everything straight.   Another problem is that even though the story wants to be as folksy and down-to-earth as possible, the thing has been so cynically constructed to press the audience's buttons that it is easy to grow resentful towards it. In its efforts to jerk tears, the film gives us, among other things, the blind, the infirm, several people dead or dying of consumption, an adorable urchin who has been mute since being orphaned and a poor lass who discovers that she is pregnant in the first act and then, in accordance with Chekhov's dictum, goes off in the third. One or two of these would have been more than enough to sustain a normal movie, but this one tosses so many into the mix that a montage is required to get through all the epiphanies in the finale, and as a result none of them create even a fraction of the emotional impact they were clearly meant to have. For every Christmas-themed film that beats the odds and goes on to become perennial\u2014your \"It's a Wonderful Life\" or \"A Christmas Story\" or \"Die Hard\"\u2014there are any number that arrive each year and quickly sink into well-deserved obscurity. \"A Christmas Candle\" definitely falls into the latter group, and as candle-based religious-themed tales go, it probably will not be replacing Hanukkah anytime soon."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Pervert Park", "Review": "An observation of life in a Florida trailer park run by 120 convicted sex offenders, \"Pervert Park\" is about finding the light within society's cavernous disdain for those, to paraphrase Todd Solondz movies, we fear more than terrorists. As a staggering act of compassion and a political statement, \"Pervert Park\" starts with simple documentarian ideas\u2014capture the existence of its subjects, allow them the opportunity to claim their narrative. With profound results, \"Pervert Park\" is eye-opening about the lives of convicted sex offenders, as inspired by a degree of empathy we need not be afraid of.\u00a0 Advertisement One of many unforgettable passages from \u201cPervert Park\u201d involves a brief cameo by the directors, Lasse and Frida Barkfors, a married couple from Scandinavia. While speaking with Nancy Morais, who founded Florida Justice Transitions to take care of her son after he became a registered sex offender, she asks them, \u201cDo you think your child is perfect?\u201d \u201cWe do,\u201d Frida responds. \u201cBut that child grows up,\" Nancy responds. \"Does something bad. Makes a mistake. Just one. Never to be forgiven.\u201d\u00a0 The 120 residents of this trailer park in St. Petersburg, Florida have been living that life sentence in harmony, while taking two-year counseling sessions run by a man named Don. We meet offenders of various degrees, from misdemeanors to horrific physical assaults, as they coexist in an American neighborhood that is not run by fear of the other, nor does it seek to punish sex offenders, but treat them so that they can one day become contributors to society. \"Pervert Park\" is at once the image of a civilization built on understanding, just as much as a critique on an American prison system that dehumanizes criminals to the recidivism rate of 77% (meanwhile, the recidivism at Florida Justice Transitions is less than 1%).\u00a0 \u201cPervert Park\u201d is a full humanization of these men and women. It allows residents to share their life stories and personal tragedies while presenting them as regular folk, walking around their neighborhood on sun-kissed Florida days, having barbecues outside, the traffic of the neighboring world hundreds of feet away but mostly experienced as background noise. Footage of them filling up fishbowls, or building a new house for a new resident\u2014a vivid subtext of containment\u2014is mixed with their close-up interviews, in which they tell us about life during and after the offense that landed them into Florida Justice Transitions. As a viewer, you start to see some patterns in their stories, which often involve cycles passed on, those of abuse at a young age and/or sexual immaturity, and you witness the current state of it\u2014people like Patrick who are traumatized by their own events, sitting in their homes with tears in their eyes when recalling every detail. All lead subjects are shown taking Don's counseling sessions, but \"Pervert Park\" is catharsis on a grand scale. \"I've never told this to nobody,\" Tracy says, sharing with the world a lifetime of sexual abuse that was followed up with her own disturbing act.\u00a0 \u201cPervert Park\u201d is an extraordinary film in part for how it challenges a documentarian\u2019s decision to put a camera on a crying face like Tracy's, and to hold on it as a type of emotional climax. There's not an inkling of a dramatic jackpot within these powerful moments, captured with the same lack of intrusiveness as when cameras simply follow residents around in B-roll footage.\u00a0These shattering scenes instead are breakthroughs between the subjects and the audience, incredibly tough minutes that complete the goal of humanization.\u00a0 Advertisement The Barkfors display a vital eye within the tight running time of their directional debut, regarding what they do and don't focus on. Bookending shots linger in the movie's atmosphere, like the night image of a Waffle House sign, peeking over the darkened trailer park's wall. Similarly, the effect of the film works by how the story remains incredibly present, eschewing interviews with people from outside Florida Justice Transitions, whether they're law enforcement, or victims (without ever downplaying the severity of the resident's crimes). \"Pervert Park\" is fortified in its narrative and moral confidence by an editorial focus, as it strictly wants to show who these people are now, its lens pointed towards in-the-flesh examples of personal redemption.\u00a0 At the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, \"Pervert Park\" won a World Cinema: Documentary - Special Jury Prize, \"For its judgmental humanism and its potential to change policy around the world.\" One could argue that even by existing the film is a political gesture; it gives a voice to people who have been dehumanized by a system, within a society that just wants to erase them. But the power that this film holds is far bigger than just its subjects. By focusing with an open mind on a societal symbol of inhumanity, \"Pervert Park\" nudges us closer to the belief that, at the core of our existence, people are inherently good."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "About Alex", "Review": "While critics are ordained to go into every film by leaving\r\nas many preconceptions as possible at the door, I have to admit to something\r\nregarding \u201cAbout Alex,\u201d the new dramedy starring a number of talented TV stars,\r\nincluding Aubrey Plaza (\u201cParks and Recreation\u201d), Max Greenfield (\u201cNew Girl\u201d),\r\nJane Levy (\u201cSuburgatory\u201d) and Jason Ritter (\u201cParenthood\u201d): I\u2019m exhausted by\r\nquarter-life crisis variations on \u201cThe Big Chill.\u201d They pop up about every\r\nother month\u2014films in which a group of friends are reunited by a key event\r\n(often a death or suicide) and pull their skeletons screaming from the closet,\r\nusually over a few joints and while they dance around a cabin. The subgenre has\r\nexhausted almost all of whatever creative energy it once had, and too often\r\nfeatures talented people forced to go through overly scripted moments. And so I\r\nwas pleasantly surprised by much of \u201cAbout Alex,\u201d a film that features a\r\nstronger-than-average ensemble for this subgenre even if it too often succumbs to\r\npredictable, traditional turns of Screenwriting 101. When the more talented\r\nmembers of the cast are allowed to let their characters breathe and exist\r\noutside of their clich\u00e9s, \u201cAbout Alex\u201d has the kind of energy that reminds one,\r\neven this cynical critic, why writers and directors keep returning to this\r\noft-told tale. Advertisement Alex (Jason Ritter) has tried to kill himself, although it\u2019s clear\r\nthat it was more of a cry for help than an actual attempt on his life. A\r\nmontage of his friends getting \u201cthe call\u201d that Alex tried to shuffle off this\r\nmortal coil introduces us to his former college buddies who have now been\r\ndivided by geography and the simple progression of life. Alex\u2019s former BFFs\r\ncome to his side for a weekend to get him over the emotional hump, answer some\r\nopen questions within their circle of friends, and experience the emotional upheaval\r\nthat often comes with revelations like the fact that someone you love has tried\r\nto kill himself. Alex\u2019s closest friend is Ben (Nate Parker), a writer who has\r\nbeen dealing with intense block as he tries to figure out what to do next. Ben is\r\nshattered by the suicide attempt because he ignored Alex\u2019s phone calls in the\r\ndays leading up to it and so naturally blames himself. He wasn\u2019t there when a friend reached out his hand. Ben\r\nis partners with Siri (Maggie Grace), another of Alex\u2019s friends who happens to\r\nbe late (not as in \u201cfor dinner\u201d but as in \u201cwith child\u201d). How will Ben take it when he learns Siri is pregnant?  Josh (Max Greenfield) is the abrasive member of the group,\r\nthe one who wants to confront Alex with a WTF style of grief management to get to the bottom of why he tried to kill himself. More concerned than\r\nconfrontational is Sarah (Aubrey Plaza), who hooks up with Josh every now and\r\nthen, but has a crush on Isaac (Max Minghella), the most Yuppie of the gang. He\r\nmay have even voted for Bush (gasp). Complicating matters, Isaac brings his relatively\r\nnew girlfriend Kate (Jane Levy) for the reunion/intervention. You can imagine\r\nhow well that goes.

What\u2019s kind of refreshing about \u201cAbout Alex\u201d is\r\nthat the predictable map through the clich\u00e9s of this subgenre that seems to be\r\ncharted in the opening scenes isn\u2019t quite followed. It\u2019s crystal clear which\r\nsecrets will be revealed, but how they are brought to the surface and how they\r\nare handled is often done with more of an emphasis on character than clich\u00e9.\r\nLevy\u2019s Kate isn\u2019t merely the \u201cother woman,\u201d thanks in large part to yet another\r\nlikable performance by the star of \u201cEvil Dead,\u201d someone who I find more\r\ninteresting with each role. Jason Ritter finds the kind emotional undercurrent\r\nthat\u2019s often missing from these troubled characters. There\u2019s something honest\r\nin the way his voice quivers that makes his depression seem more genuine. There\r\nare a couple of performances that are less effective than others (the young\r\nJesse Zwick writes more honestly for the men\u2014Max Minghella, Nate Parker\u2014than for\r\ntheir female counterparts\u2014both Maggie Grace and Aubrey Plaza feel underwritten),\r\nbut when Zwick allows his characters to breathe, \u201cAbout Alex\u201d feels true. The\r\nset-up and climax may be overwritten, but what\u2019s in the middle has a purity of\r\ncharacter often missing from the genre. I wish Zwick trusted his cast a bit\r\nmore to give them fewer contrivances and more scenes of friendly interaction,\r\nbut there\u2019s enough here to make one anticipate what he does next.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "A.C.O.D.", "Review": "\"A.C.O.D.\", an acronym that stands for Adult Children of Divorce, could easily be played for heavy drama. Carter (Adam Scott) is in many ways a model A.C.O.D., heroically tolerant of his warring parents Hugh (Richard Jenkins) and Melissa (Catherine O'Hara), wry and distanced but still open enough to try to love other people.  That openness is a hard-won victory. His parents are jerks, and the tricky thing about them is that they're charismatic jerks, selfish and self-indulgent Baby Boomers whose mantra is always \"the heart wants what it wants.\" They are monsters, basically, and they are believable monsters, and first-time director Stu Zicherman never makes them more outlandish than they should be to get broader or bigger laughs. When Melissa tells her younger son Trey (Clark Duke), \"Darling, you were a mistake,\" it takes a second or two to process the fact that she is actually telling him this in an attempt to be reassuring. A moment like this is not either funny or sad: it's shocking, and it gets to the root of the mystery of some human behavior.  Advertisement The film starts off rather badly with a flashback to Carter's ninth birthday party and some \"Arrested Development\"-aping narration, but it soon abandons this conceit and finds a specific tone of its own. \"A.C.O.D.\" is a sharp, dark-ish character comedy, settling for a dry tolerance in its point of view that is very appealing and even admirable.   Carter has to deal not only with his family but also with a totally unprofessional counselor named Dr. Judith (Jane Lynch), an oblivious and self-centered quasi-scientist who made big bucks out of telling his childhood story in a book and who now wants to make more money with a sequel. Hugh's new trophy wife Sondra (Amy Poehler) is also in the mix, so we have three major comic actresses working at their best level here, insisting on the truth of the people they are playing and letting any laughs take care of themselves.  At first, I wasn't quite sure what O'Hara was doing with her character, but it turned out that she was already so advanced in her playing of this woman that I just needed to catch up with Melissa's brusque and imperturbable self-absorption. Lynch works in the bossy vein that she has mined on her TV show \"Glee\" and in other films, but as with O'Hara there is a core of human insight to what she's doing. And Poehler takes a role that might have been merely window dressing and makes a three-dimensional, very troubled person out of her.   It's been said often, but it is worth saying again: comic actors never seem to get awards or even nominations for the work that they do, but it seems clear to me that O'Hara, Lynch and Poehler are all working at as high a level of technique and creativity as, say, Cate Blanchett or Kate Winslet without signaling that they are Acting. They are doing very original work here, and they are matched by Jenkins, who makes his heel of a Dad into a force of nature to match O'Hara's Melissa, and Scott, who holds the whole film together with a discreet kind of charm, kindness and willing self-effacement.   \"A.C.O.D.\" is written and directed with a sure hand, and if the editing sometimes feels a little anxious, that's understandable for a first feature. Zicherman's sensibility is subtle, graceful, scrupulously fair, and intelligent without having to make a show of intelligence. His first film is a model of what a modern film comedy might be.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Broken", "Review": "The title \"Broken\" most directly refers to families, but it's also an adequate assessment of the Rufus Norris's debut feature, an absorbing coming-of-age drama that suddenly, pointlessly self-destructs with an onslaught of cheap ironies and overkill. Until then, it's a tense portrait of three English homes, all clustered around the same cul-de-sac, and how one lie and an ensuing act of violence reverberate through the residents' lives. Norris, a West End veteran, edits his film in an oblique, lyrical style that one associates more with David Gordon Green than with the stage. Events are sometimes seen slightly out of order, organized for impact rather than chronology. The catalyzing incident is seen first: As 11-year-old Skunk (a wonderful Eloise Laurence) looks on, her neighbor Mr. Oswald (Rory Kinnear) viciously beats Rick Buckley (Robert Emms), the frightened and mildly learning-disabled man who lives next door. Flashing back a few minutes, we learn that one of Mr. Oswald's daughters, Susan (Rosalie Kosky-Hensman), has falsely accused Rick of rape rather than confess to an innocent misunderstanding. Her father has found an opened condom wrapper in their home, mistaking it for a sign of her promiscuity. The matter is sorted out, but the damage is done. Traumatized Rick is sent to an institution, while Susan will go on to fool around the way her violent dad always feared. Advertisement But back to Skunk: Children are impressionable, and the sight of the attack stays with her. She worries that Rick will suffer treatment along the lines of what she saw in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\" Her own life is in flux, from a bourgeoning first love to anxiety over being bullied at a new school, where her nanny's commitment-fearing boyfriend (Cillian Murphy) works as a teacher. Skunk has Type 1 diabetes and monitors her blood sugar on her own. She has to be independent: Her mother walked out on the family, and her lawyer father (Tim Roth) raises them, perhaps slightly lovesick himself, as well as slightly wary of the brutish patriarch next door. If it isn't obvious already\u2014from the assonance of Skunk's name with Scout; the way Roth's solicitor is called on to defend the falsely accused; or the way Rick functions as a Boo Radley figure\u2014\"Broken\" has been quite transparently conceived as an homage to \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" which author Daniel Clay, who wrote the novel on which the film is based, has acknowledged as an inspiration. At times the movie seems closer to full reworking than tribute, and there's a fascination in seeing a quintessentially American story transplanted to a British context. To the extent that \"Broken\" follows Harper Lee's template\u2014observing a child's dawning awareness of the morally troubled world around her\u2014it's quite good. But context is key, and while Lee's masterwork turned an eye on 1930s Alabama, \"Broken\" doesn't show much interest in the world beyond the cul-de-sac. Dramatically, the film is a closed system, in which just about every major action prompts an unintended consequence, and the best intentions unfailingly go awry. In that sense, \"Broken\" owes more to didactic tapestry films like \"Babel\" than to one of the great works of 20th-century literature. Imagine \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" with multiple trumped-up medical emergencies and a cynically manipulative finale, and you might have a sense of how Norris's film plays by the end: broken, smashed, destroyed.

{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "The Clapper", "Review": "\"The\u00a0Clapper\", directed by Dito Montiel, is an adaptation of his 2007 novel Eddie Krumble is the\u00a0Clapper, about a guy who makes a sparse living as a professional \"clapper,\" those people hired to applaud or ask pre-planned questions in infomercial audiences. In the novel, real-life late night host Jay Leno notices that the same guy is in the audience at all of these different infomercials, so he starts a nationwide quest to discover the man's identity. The anonymous Eddie becomes a media sensation. It's a pretty thin premise on which to base a movie (or a novel, for that matter). There's a critique in there somewhere about innocent humans getting devoured by the celebrity-driven media culture, but \"The\u00a0Clapper\" is so poorly done, its tone so lackadaisical and uncommitted, it's not clear half the time what you're even watching. If it's supposed to be a comedy, it's not funny. If it's supposed to be a satire, it doesn't know what it's satirizing. The biggest problem is that the stakes are never high enough to invest in any of it. Advertisement Ed Helms plays Eddie, a guy content with his gig as a \"clapper,\" traveling to and from the various studio lots with his fellow\u00a0clapper\u00a0Chris (Tracy Morgan), and practicing his \"spontaneous\" questions in the mirror at home. Eddie is not a struggling actor who dreams of being De Niro. He likes the gig as it is. He has a crush on Judy (Amanda Seyfried), who works at a nearby gas station. He visits her there and they share awkward banter through the thick glass screen of her booth. There are no real obstacles for this couple (he likes her, she likes him), and when an obstacle comes it is completely manufactured. Of course, Ed is given a sad backstory, but you never feel like Eddie has come from anywhere. It's hard to \"invest\" in a character who doesn't want much. Judy is given \"quirks\"\u2014she owns a goat with one horn, for example\u2014but \"quirky\" doesn't equal \"interesting.\"\u00a0 The first 15 minutes of the movie shows Eddie's experiences as a\u00a0clapper. Alan Thicke plays the smooth-talking host of one of the infomercials. Leah Remini plays the woman who organizes the clappers, handing out checks, making sure everyone applauds with gusto. Brenda Vaccaro plays Eddie's mother, leaving him clueless messages on his answering machine about his busy television career. Chris and Eddie do everything together, although it's hard to describe their relationship as a friendship. Neither of them appear to have any other friends. Then, randomly, late-night host Jayme Stillerman (Russell Peters) creates a \"bit\" out of Eddie's background appearances, and a nationwide \"manhunt\" begins, Eddie's face appearing on billboards surrounded by the words \"WHO IS THE\u00a0CLAPPER?\" This unwanted notoriety gets in the way of his fledgling romance with Judy, and he discovers fame\u2014which he never wanted in the first place\u2014is not fun. In the television series \"Extras,\" Ricky Gervais used the movie extra sub-culture to lampoon show business as a whole. Punctuated by cameos from huge stars playing themselves (Kate Winslet, Ben Stiller, Samuel Jackson), the series made fun of its characters but also went after the competitiveness that makes the larger industry so ugly, not at just the A-List level but the extras level too. When Gervais' character actually does get a break and writes a hit TV show, he finds that fame is not all it's cracked up to be. \"The Extras\" did what \"The Clapper\" doesn't do. It used its sub-culture as a way to explore its themes, of fame, need, drive, ambition. It had a strong point of view about its subject. \"The Clapper\", however, uses its sub-culture as only semi-interesting background for the romance between Ed and Judy, so unromantic that when they declare themselves to one another they have to keep repeating their lines as though they need convincing. There's nothing to hold onto here. \"The Clapper\" isn't about anything.  The cast of is made up of very talented actors. But when even Tracy Morgan seems underwater, when even he doesn\u2019t have one funny moment, you know something is really wrong.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Shuttle", "Review": "Why do I have to watch this movie? Why does anyone? What was the impulse behind this sad, cruel story? Is there, as they say, \"an audience for it\"? I guess so. The critic \"Tex Massacre\" at bloodydisgusting.com rates it four skulls out of five, and says, \"while gorehounds might not be doing backflips over the blood loss, they should appreciate that director Edward Anderson makes the kills relatively painful and wholly grounded in reality.\" I'm not sure if the gorehounds will think there is too much blood loss or too little. Never mind. At least the killings are relatively painful. There's that to be said for it. But I think it's a cop-out to review this movie only as an entry in the horror/slasher genre and not pull back for a larger context. Do images have no qualities other than their technical competence? Advertisement \"Shuttle\" opens with two young women arriving at an almost empty airport at 2 a.m. It's raining. They can't get a cab. A guy in a van says he'll take them downtown for $15. He already has one passenger. Now two young guys also want a ride. Guy says, nothing doing. One girl says, they're with us. Two guys get on board. Under the driver's window is painted, \"No more than three stops.\" That's strange. Looks like there's room for 16, 20 people in the van. The driver takes them on a strange route into no-man's land, pulls a gun, takes all five passengers hostage. OK, so far we're in standard horror territory. It's what comes next that grows disturbing. The women, played by Peyton List and Cameron Goodman, are resourceful and try to fight back. The young guys help, but are neutralized. The other passenger is a crybaby. The film seems set up to empower women. I won't say more about the plot, except that it leads to utter hopelessness and evil. That things happen as they do in \"Shuttle\" I suppose is true, however rarely. But a film can have an opinion about them. This one simply serves them up in hard merciless detail. There is no release for the audience, no \"entertainment,\" not even much action excitement. Just a remorseless march into the dark. There is good work here. Peyton List, now 22, working on TV since 2000, is effective as Mel, the more resourceful of the girls. She has a Neve Campbell quality. Cullen Douglas, as the driver, isn't your usual menacing monster but has more of a workaday attitude inflicting suffering. And writer-director Edward Anderson is reasonably skilled at filmmaking, although it becomes a major distraction when he has the bus drive through miles of empty streets when, as the plot reveals, there is little reason. Advertisement Last week I reviewed the latest version of \"The Last House on the Left.\" It had qualities, too, including more developed characters and more ingenious action sequences. But \"Shuttle\" is uninterested in visual style; it wants to appear nuts and bolts, unsentimental, pushing our face in it. I know the horror genre is a traditional port of entry for first-time directors on low budgets, and I suppose that is Anderson's purpose. All right, he has proven himself. Now let him be less passionately infatuated with despair. Note: The \"R\" rating proves once again that it is impossible for a film to be rated NC-17 for violence alone."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "The Night Of", "Review": "HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d starting Sunday and airing over the\r\nnext eight weeks, unfolds like the great novels of one of its creators, Richard\r\nPrice. The author of \u201cClockers\u201d and \u201cSamaritan\u201d (among many others, but those\r\nare definite must-reads) has an amazing ability to tell stories of crime that\r\naren\u2019t mere whodunits but survey and analyze the cultural and urban landscape\r\nas their mystery unfolds. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d contains universal truths but also\r\ncouldn\u2019t take place anywhere other than where it does and when it does, in a\r\npost-9/11 New York City. It approaches one crime from several\r\ndifferent angles without ever losing the narrative or feeling unfocused. Each\r\nepisode feels like it introduces us to a new major player just as essential as\r\nthe one before, from the murder suspect himself to an attorney who lucks upon the case of\r\nhis life to the retiring cop investigating one last criminal act and so on and so on. It\r\nis about the immigrant experience in NYC, the cruelty of the criminal-creating\r\nestablishment known as Rikers Island, a legal system in which guilt and\r\ninnocence are often afterthoughts, and, ultimately, a fascinating mystery. It\r\nis Agatha Christie meets \u201cThe Wire,\u201d and it\u2019s one of the best things on TV in\r\nan already-great year. Advertisement The opening hour-plus of \u201cThe Night Of\u201d spends almost all of\r\nits time with Nasir \u201cNaz\u201d Khan (Riz Ahmed from \u201cNightcrawler,\u201d and also\r\nappearing in the upcoming \u201cJason Bourne\u201d and \u201cStar Wars: Rogue One\u201d in an\r\neffort to have the most breakthrough 2016 possible), a Pakistani-American\r\ncollege student living in Queens. He seems like a nice kid, the kind stunned to\r\nbe invited to a cool party in Manhattan on an October night. When his friend, who is also his ride,\r\nbails on him, Naz \u201cborrows\u201d his father\u2019s taxi to go into the city. As he\u2019s\r\ntrying to find the party, a beautiful young woman gets into his cab. She wants\r\nto go to the beach. She's pretty enough and mysterious enough that Naz plays along. By the end of the night, he\u2019ll be arrested\r\nfor murder.  This first hour, shot by the legendary Robert Elswit (\u201cThere\r\nWill Be Blood,\u201d \u201cInherent Vice\u201d) and directed by Steven Zaillian (all but one\r\nhour were helmed by the director of \u201cSearching For Bobby Fischer,\u201d and that one\r\nwas directed by \u201cMan on Wire\u201d\u2019s James Marsh), hums like the best procedurals.\r\nModern, educated TV audiences know something is going to happen to Naz\u2014there\u2019s\r\nno show otherwise\u2014but the premiere takes its time with details that you won\u2019t\r\neven know matter until episodes later when the show is in trial. Every\r\nencounter, every decision, every moment feels both naturally captured\u2014thanks in\r\nlarge part to Ahmed\u2019s spectacularly lived-in performance, which only gets better in subsequent episodes\u2014and also part of a\r\ncomplex piece of art. In that sense, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d reminds one of Lumet\u2019s '70s and \u201880s\r\nfilms in that character is never lost in the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of mystery or\r\ncommentary. Lumet had an incredible ability to tell NY stories that were both sprawling and intimate. \"The Night Of\" shares that duality. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the arguable protagonist of the\r\npiece, attorney John Stone (John Turturro) has echoes of Paul Newman\u2019s Frank Galvin from \u201cThe Verdict.\u201d He carries around business cards with his smiling face\r\nand just happens on Naz in the precinct holding cell on the fateful night in question. Does he see innocence\r\nin Naz\u2019s eyes? Or does he just see opportunity? Exactly what each of the key characters in \u201cThe Night Of\u201d are getting out of the situation, especially major\r\nplayers like Detective Box (the great Bill Camp) and a young attorney named Chandra\r\n(Amara Karan), becomes essential to the way it unfolds. And when Naz gets to\r\nRikers, where young men are held until trial and either hardened further or\r\npossibly even killed, he meets a career criminal (the mesmerizing Michael K. Williams) who\r\nsees him as an opportunity. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d exemplifies the ripple effect of not just crime but the mechanics of a\r\ncriminal investigation, from the men whose path crosses with Naz\u2019s at Rikers to\r\nhis family (including the great Asghar Farhadi regular Peyman Maadi as Naz\u2019s father),\r\nunable to cover his defense.  Advertisement On top of all these great ensemble performances and\r\nmemorable characters, there\u2019s a riveting procedural element to \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d\r\nespecially in the early episodes, in which Zaillian and Price display an\r\nobvious fascination and respect for relatively unwanted jobs being done\u2014from the\r\ngraveyard shift at the police station to the morgue attendants and so on. It\u2019s\r\nthe kind of show where you distinctly hear the squeak of a dry erase marker as it writes \u201cHomicide\u201d\r\non the white board. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d doesn\u2019t cut corners, giving Price fans the\r\ndetails they expect but that we rarely see in episodic television. And yet the\r\nbalance between detail and character is never thrown off. In one sense, it\u2019s a\r\nprocedural with a protagonist uninterested in procedure or facts (Stone makes\r\nclear that he doesn\u2019t care if Naz did it or not\u2014actual guilt or innocence is\r\nonly one issue in the criminal justice system). It unfolds confidently as a\r\ngreat crime novel AND as a character study of two men who would never meet if not for a murder, likely because of Price\u2019s ability\r\nwith the detailed mechanics of the crime novel mixed with Zaillian\u2019s very human touch with actors. Let\u2019s hope\r\nthey work together again soon. (Note: They only made seven of eight episodes available for press so if it all goes off the rails in the final\r\nhour, remember the star rating is based on what I\u2019ve seen. I have faith, though.)"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Mohawk", "Review": "For the sake of full disclosure, I should begin this review of the exciting War of 1812 revenge-thriller \"Mohawk\" by saying that I'm friends with director Ted Geoghegan and his\u00a0co-writer Grady Hendrix. This, admittedly, means that I tend to forgive their scrappy little genre hybrid's rougher patches. It also means that I tend to value their chutzpah more than their\u00a0ability to fully develop the world of avenging heroine\u00a0Oak (Kaniehtiio Horn), a young Mohawk Indian who is targeted and hunted by a group of blood-thirsty\u00a0American deserters.\u00a0 Advertisement Geoghegan and Hendrix have the right instincts, which goes a long way, given that their vision is slightly limited by their budget. I didn't just fall for this type of film:\u00a0I also admire its creators' knack for conveying what they like most\u00a0about their\u00a0characters through\u00a0pulpy\u00a0dialogue, impressive\u00a0shot choices, and satisfyingly gory set pieces.\u00a0 Oak is not, after all, a typical western heroine. She's one-third of a menage a trois with reserved Mohawk\u00a0Calvin (Justin Rain) and jittery\u00a0British arms dealer Joshua (\"Twin Peaks\" star Eamon Farren). This relationship is remarkable for a couple of reasons, the chief one being the way that Geoghegan and Hendrix gently defy decades of generic expectations that have taught us to favor Calvin and mistrust Joshua. Calvin is, admittedly, the more sympathetic of Oak's two lovers. But Joshua isn't just another self-involved exploiteer. Which thankfully means that Oak's faith in Joshua and\u00a0the new settlers who inevitably decimate the Mohawk tribe\u00a0is thankfully not dismissed as proof of her naive faith. That said:\u00a0\"Mohawk\" is also thankfully\u00a0not\u00a0\"The Last of the Mohicans\" meets \"The Dreamers,\" but rather a little melodrama that quickly shifts gears into war/horror\u00a0territory.\u00a0Instead, Geoghegan and Hendrix quickly establish Oak, Calvin, and Joshua's fragile bond in a handful of small scenes. These young lovers quietly lavish attention on each other simply by staring, embracing, and getting high together in (perhaps too-tight) extreme close-ups. And for a while,\u00a0you can buy that this type of relationship was normal for these characters.\u00a0 But Oak is soon confronted by blood-thirsty American Hezekiah Holt (Ezra Buzzington), and his\u00a0small band\u00a0of misfit deserters. These stereotypically ugly Americans\u00a0are portrayed\u00a0with a little too much broad, goony humor, especially since they are often as freakish\u00a0as they look and/or act. One of them\u00a0(Robert Longstreet) has a\u00a0a\u00a0Don Van Vliet-style croak of a voice, and a\u00a0clunky, steam-punk-worthy set of goggles covering half of his face.\u00a0Another one\u00a0(Jon Huber) is seemingly covered\u00a0from\u00a0brow to\u00a0chin (and\u00a0beyond)\u00a0in facial hair\u00a0and/or\u00a0sweat. And don't get me started on the shy one (Rian Johnson regular Noah Segan) who predictably dies\u00a0early on.\u00a0 Advertisement That said: Geoghegan and Hendrix do deliberately strip away their baddies' ranks so that their most sympathetic antagonists disappear first, leaving behind only the most unlikable antagonists to fend for themselves. In this context, Huber's character, an overwhelmed grunt, looks better than some, but worse than others simply because he failed to take steps to help Oak and/or stop Holt. Even the villains\u00a0are sympathetic enough to be compelling,\u00a0despite some sketchy details.\u00a0 Still, the fact that these characters can essentially\u00a0be\u00a0boiled down to first impressions says a lot about this film's point-of-view. Holt's desperation\u00a0eventually becomes more sensible: he thinks he's the victim. But \"Mohawk\" is really Oak's story, so it's fitting that Holt's gang has the kind of paradoxical flat-ness and immediacy that monsters often do in our nightmares.\u00a0 You can see Geoghegan and Hendrix's flinty, dream logic most clearly during\u00a0their film's big action/chase set pieces, like Oak and Holt's climactic final showdown. You can also also see their attention to detail in the way that they studiously avoid cliches, like their refusal to give us a full, psychologically comprehensible breakdown of Oak's character. She's a little mysterious throughout, even though her actions, and concerns, are always fairly well-grounded. Geoghegan and Hendrix have all the right ideas, and usually in the right proportions. \"Mohawk\" consequently has the same political urgency as Wes Craven's now-classic, but rough-around-the-edges early films, like \"Last House on the Left\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes.\" I have no idea if this film will enjoy the same status as Craven's masterful provocations, nor do I expect it to. But I'm so grateful that \"Mohawk,\" a movie that I wanted to love, is as small and energizing as it is."}
{"Stars": 0.5, "Title": "Mad Women", "Review": "Jeff Lipsky's \"Mad Women\" is a series of interminable monologues, two or three per scene. Characters sit around, even during tense confrontations, and listen to each other talk without interruption. The actors feel at sea in a torrent of words. The plot of \"Mad Women\" is ridiculous, unmotivated and \"shocking,\" but that wouldn't be an issue at all if there had been some attempt at style, or mood, or a point of view.\u00a0 The Smith family is a piece of work. There's mom Harper (Christina Starbuck), who has done jail time for conspiracy to commit murder (she planned to kill a domestic terrorist responsible for attacks on abortion clinics), and is now running for mayor of her town on an insane platform involving getting rid of the post office, bulldozing cemeteries and seceding from the nation. There's dentist dad Richard (Reed Birney), jailed for statutory rape (the rape took place in the bathroom at a Jackson Browne concert, while he was high on LSD). They have three daughters: one died at the age of 3, the other lives abroad working with Doctors Without Borders, and the middle child, Nevada (Kelsey Lynn Stokes), is a post-grad, living at home, reading, playing tennis and wreaking sexual havoc.\u00a0 Advertisement Otto (Eli Percy) leers at Nevada from afar while she plays tennis. Finally, one day, she confronts him about it. She punches him in the stomach. He punches her right back and she falls to the ground. Then they go out for coffee. Then they go home and have sex. Then they start dating. None of this is convincing in any way whatsoever. Their performances are stilted and awkward. It's painful to watch.\u00a0 The title seems to suggest that every woman in the film is \"mad\" in some way or other. What does madness mean to Lipsky? It's unclear. There's Harper, whose nutty political campaign speech punctuates the entire film. She seems off her rocker, but her audience laughs and nods in approval. There's Nevada's one-eyed grandmother devoted to archery, despite her lack of peripheral vision. Nevada has no boundaries, and tells her therapist in a flirty way that she is \"shallow\": she remembers playing in a bathtub with 5 other children when she was a kid: \"I was shallow ... in the shallow end of the tub,\" she concludes (an example of the overwritten script).\u00a0 In one of the \"maddest\" scenes, Nevada comes on to her mother sexually, and the two begin a passionate affair. Say what? It's queasy and taboo, sure, but it could have shown the nasty no-boundaries underbelly of the high-achieving Smith family, but Lipsky is unable to manage such complexity. The actors seem embarrassed, as though they are going through the motions, obeying the script before they as actors figured out why the characters are doing what they are doing. When Nevada tells Otto about the affair with her mother, he says, \"You're cheating on me? With your mother?\" Kelsey Lynn Stokes' line readings tend towards a sarcastic bored-teen eye-roll attitude, which wears out its welcome almost immediately.\u00a0 There's a juvenile obsession with the female body. There are multiple mentions of menstruation, \"pooping\", pubic hair ... as though these are not natural elements in a woman's human life but strange anomalies that warrant a double-take. Nevada tells Otto she's on the pill, and he seems surprised at her openness about being sexually active. Really? Lars von Trier tackles such stuff humorously, intelligently in \"Nymphomaniac,\" a dissertation on female sexuality and the male reaction to it. Male fascination with female bodies has often been the primal stuff of art. Nothing wrong with that, necessarily. But \"Mad Women\" lacks self-awareness about it. There's a lot of leering in \"Mad Women,\" including a neighbor who spends all of his free time staring into the Smith house from the next lawn with binoculars. The Smith family all brush it off: \"Oh, that's just the way he is.\" Is \"Mad Women\" a comedy? A satire? Who knows.\u00a0 Advertisement Last year's wonderful \"The Strange Little Cat\" also featured a lot of theatrical monologuing, but the device was used in a Brechtian way, cluing the audience into the fact that the film was not meant to be realistic. The monologues were dreamy, strange and compelling. In \"Mad Women,\" they are boring, repetitive and too descriptive. The other actors in the scene sit there, listening patiently, never interrupting. Maybe \"Mad Women\" isn't supposed to be realistic but Lipsky has not set up a style that helps any of this make sense. His direction is uninspired, featuring a lot of long unmoving takes, with two people sitting in the same space, as one of them talks for 5 minutes. The language is so artificial that you can still picture it as typeface on the script-page. The scenes feel like the first table-read.\u00a0 Halfway through the film, Nevada asks Otto, \"You want to hear an epic story?\"\u00a0 No thanks. I'm good."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Whose Streets?", "Review": "The first thing you need to know about the documentary \"Whose Streets?\", about the chaos that engulfed Ferguson, Missouri after a 2014 police shooting, is that it is not meant to be a comprehensive, academic, all-things-to-all-viewers look at its subject. From its opening scene, which puts a camera in the back seat of a car as it eavesdrops on two people in the front, this film by Sabaah Folayan and Damon Davis tells you very plainly what it is: a subjective, literally ground-level look at this story\u2014one that privileges the point-of-view of predominantly working class and poor African-Americans in a suburb of St. Louis.  Advertisement The fact that the movie contains no interviews with police officers or government authorities has sparked some backlash among film critics who, one assumes, wanted more of an \"on the one hand, on the other hand\" approach. But there are dozens of written and filmed accounts of Ferguson that have already done that. This account is entirely concerned with what activists and ordinary citizens, and ordinary citizens who became activists, saw and felt in the weeks that followed the killing of unarmed Ferguson resident Michael Brown, a black man, by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, a white man. The race and class of the participants is central to the movie, because they help explain not just the point-of-view of the filmmaking, but the movie's relationship to the rest of American media and society.\u00a0 This documentary is one piece of a prismatic American narrative of race and power that can stand alone, as a report from a community that was briefly a near-war zone, or that can be watched in relation to versions of the tale as told by TV news crews, Internet outlets, newspapers, magazines, radio reporters and social media commentators. What makes it unique and valuable is that it is not like those other versions, and has no interest in trying to be like them. The movie recounts not just the major incidents but also the black Ferguson community's specific point-of-view on what happened, with the anger and frustration that point-of-view entails. It is a straightforward attempt to redress an imbalance of storytelling power\u2014to see and hear people who felt misrepresented or ignored at the time. Brown, 18, was shot August 9, 2014, after stealing goods from a convenience store, then struggling with an officer through his squad car window. Brown fled the scene and Wilson followed, firing twelve shots at Brown, one of which killed him. A story quickly circulated that Brown put his hands in the air and told Wilson, \"Hands up, don't shoot!\"; Ferguson police officials and the justice department later disputed that detail, but it became an integral part of protest chants in Ferguson and elsewhere. Ferguson police released video from inside the convenience store showing Brown stealing a box of Swisher cigars and shoving a clerk, information that many in the community considered a bad faith attempt to smear an unarmed shooting victim by making it seem as if he somehow deserved to die. The department send heavily armed officers in riot gear and all-terrain vehicles to corral and push back protestors. The state government established a curfew. There were sporadic reports of looting, but for the most part the protests were nonviolent. Images of civilians taunting police and police manhandling civilians, buildings and cars burning, and chemical weapons, including tear gas, being used against civilians in an American city brought back collective memories of Detroit in 1967 and Los Angeles in 1992. Advertisement \"Whose Streets?\" replays all of this and more, but inverts the point-of-view. Rather than hear the story from news reporters and government officials, we hear it from a marcher who surveys a line of heavily armored police and says, \"This is the military police. This is not the police we all know,\" and from activists who characterize police response as an over-response that's meant to demonstrate power rather than keep peace.\u00a0 We get the sense of black people in Ferguson, who live in the city, and a predominantly white police force, much of which lives elsewhere, locked in a vicious cycle: street crime met by police violence met by protest (nonviolent and violent) met by an escalation of police presence that looks like footage from the early occupation of Iraq (a frequent comparison point for protestors). \"We're trying to mourn, and you came here with 300 cop cars and riot gear  and canine units,\" says Ashley, a local activist. \"This is the same thing that pretty much got us here.\" The title \"Whose Streets?\" poses a question that goes beyond geography and politics to encompass journalism and storytelling. When events as seismic as the Ferguson shooting and ensuing police crackdown and riots happen, the vast majority of people beyond ground zero experience a version of events that are filtered by mainstream media outlets and government spokespeople. The latter are invested in a particular, subjective, self-serving spin on events, just as the protestors are. The difference is that the media and government framework tends to present their version of the story as sober, objective and responsible, and any counter-narrative as a hysterical provocation, even when, say, Wilson likens Brown to a \"demon\" in an official report, and insists he's entirely free of racial animosity while a TV interviewer, ABC's George Stephanopoulos, stares blankly at him, so astonished that he can't find the words to argue why Wilson might be wrong about that.  There are points where this movie seems to want to right that imbalance of storytelling authority all by its lonesome, an impossible goal. There are also moments where the filmmakers don't always trust the innate power of the footage they've gathered on the ground and in people's homes, at community meetings and in conversations on sidewalks and in cars. There isn't much intrusion by the film's musical score, but when it does come in, you notice it, and not in a good way. \"Whose Streets?\" may also prove to be of limited value as a historical document precisely because of its decision to leave the broad-strokes, \"this happened and then that happened\" storytelling to mainstream sources while it lives in the in-between spaces, where activists balance neighborhood organizing and vocal protest with the requirements of daily life: making rent, raising their kids. But these are minor quibbles with a major work. This is a movie that doesn't merely tell a gripping, important story, but reminds us that the storyteller and the storytelling matter just as much.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Road Games", "Review": "If you, like me, are a cult film aficionado, you might work yourself into an unnecessary dither upon seeing a new psychological thriller about hitchhikers with the title \"Road\u00a0Games.\" If this movie title means nothing to you, do not panic. Heck, you should take deep breaths through your mouth even if you do worship the superb 1981 Hitchcock homage of the same name (starring Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee Curtis). The new \"Road\u00a0Games,\" writer/director Abner Pastoll's sophomore feature, has very little to do with the earlier movie of the same name. This film's title is just an artful tip of the cap to a primary influence. Pastoll's project is, unlike many contemporary indie thrillers, genuinely moody in parts since\u00a0it was filmed by people who want to put you on edge just by focusing on desolate back roads, creaking floorboards, and circuitous conversations. So yes, you can enjoy \"Road\u00a0Games\" even if you aren't a gorehound. I wish I could recommend \"Road\u00a0Games\" beyond that though, since all\u00a0roads\u00a0lead to a twist ending that you can kinda-sorta make out\u00a0from a mile off. By preferring to keep viewers in suspense until the film's finale, Pastoll makes it harder to recommend a movie that has many good ideas, but no clue what to do with\u00a0them. Advertisement Later in his film, Pastoll helps viewers understand what they just saw by naming a never-seen character after Claude Chabrol, the master French filmmaker whose singularly playful thrillers include \"Le Boucher\" and \"Le Beau Serge.\" By winking at cinephiles in this way, Pastoll encourages us to revel in his characters' conspicuous attempts at misdirection. You're supposed to\u00a0feel like you are kinda-sorta in on these characters' schemes, even if you really aren't. So hold onto your initial misgivings about good guy hitchhiker Jack (Andrew Simpson) and mysterious companion V\u00e9ronique (Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume):\u00a0that slight prickling of discomfort you get around these characters is intentional.\u00a0 Or at least, that's how you're meant to enjoy watching the main part of \"Road\u00a0Games.\" There are two narrative layers at work here: a\u00a0straight-forward serial-killer plot, and Jack and V\u00e9ronique's not-so-subtly hidden backstories. The plot focuses on interplay between Jack, V\u00e9ronique, and creepy motorist Grizard (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pierrot), a brutish Frenchman who picks our weary travelers up, and gives them very little reason to trust him. I mean, look at this guy: his unkempt hair, and squat mongoloid build scream, \"Frustrated alpha-male artist/serial-killer/Dairy Queen employee in training.\" What's Grizard hiding? How is terrified wife Mary (scream queen Barbara Crampton!) involved? And where do they keep the bodies?\u00a0 But Ben and V\u00e9ronique's respective lives before the road trip are the crux of Pastoll's promising old-school thriller. This part of the film is crucial. For starters, you have to buy that this young couple have romantic chemistry, and Simpson sadly can't keep up with de La Baume. Pastoll also sometimes doesn't seem to know how to get the most out of de La Baume's withdrawn performance. As a result, sparks do not fly when these characters flirt with each other, though their body parts are filmed well during a genuinely sexy sex scene. Advertisement More importantly: Pastoll treats hints about his characters' past as if they were the only card up his sleeve. That's a problem since we, as viewers, should be lost in frustrated banter between Grizard and Jack, or Jack and V\u00e9ronique. Conversation is the thing, and so much dialogue stops and starts with tidbit-sized clues/red herrings, like when V\u00e9ronique talks about practicing her signature, or Ben mentions his cheating ex-girlfriend. These little moments shouldn't be too obvious since that would detract from the film's main plot. But realistically, they're the soul of the film, especially given how rote the rest of the plot is. If you like horror films, or thrillers, you've probably heard this one before: a guy and girl fall in love, get terrorized by a creepy foreigner, must\u00a0escape. Big deal, so what? Well, I don't know, actually. I want to commend Pastoll for telling a thrice-told tale with style and doing it in such an inviting way that I sometimes got lost waiting for the proverbial other shoe to drop. But then the climax of \"Road\u00a0Games\" comes to mind, and that pretty much ruins the rest of the movie. What to do with a mood piece whose creators inadvertently put so much weight on the finale, and then can't\u00a0deliver a satisfying resolution?\u00a0 I don't know if I can recommend \"Road\u00a0Games.\" Moviegoers should check it out if they're curious since it does stand apart from other contemporary thrillers. But \"recommend\" is probably too strong a word. I want to see what Pastoll does next, and hope people give him that opportunity by seeing \"Road\u00a0Games.\" But I can't honestly say I enjoyed Pastoll's breakthrough film beyond that. You should know what generic perils await you before watching this one. It's not as tricky as it should be, but it is appropriately tantalizing."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Maya Dardel", "Review": "In writer-directors Zachary Cotler and Magdalena Zyzak's debut feature film \"Maya Dardel,\" the title character is an internationally renowned poet who feels her best work is behind her. The three celebrated volumes she wrote in her 30s made her name. Now, moving into the twilight of her life, posterity is on her mind. She has no family, no husband, no children. All that matters is her work. Self-pity is not in her makeup, one of her most startling characteristics. Maya Dardel is played by the great Lena Olin, an actress of enormous power and intelligence, and her presence\u2014prickly, intimidating, unpredictable, frankly sexual\u2014is justification alone for the film's existence. Where \"Maya Dardel\" really works is when it sticks to being a character study. No matter what else happens (and quite a bit happens), it is Olin\u2014and the questions her character provokes (\"Who is she? What does she want? Did she really just say that??\")\u2014that lets this film off its pretty short self-imposed leash. Advertisement The opening scene shows Maya, calling into an NPR radio show from her living room to calmly announce that she plans to commit suicide, but before she does she needs to appoint someone executor of her literary estate. She announces that any young writer interested in the gig should reach out to her agent. \"Women need not apply,\" she says, and then elaborates with eviscerating bluntness: \"Because I don't like women's writing.\" It's a hell of an opening. Maya is not emotional about committing suicide. She doesn't even seem particularly depressed. Her voice is unbroken by softness or sentimentality. One of the biggest traps for actors is feeling sentimental about the characters they play. Lena Olin has never fallen into those traps. It's refreshing to watch an actress not care about being liked to the degree that Olin does. What ensues after the call to NPR is a contest-type scenario, where she holds a series of \"interviews\" with the male writers interested in managing her posthumous reputation. Young men, accustomed to ignoring older women to the point of not seeing them at all, are tossed into a whirlpool of confusion while trapped by her predatory unforgiving gaze. They struggle to maintain their sense of unearned superiority. It doesn't really come as a surprise when she ends each interview by demanding the candidates perform oral sex on her. The cunnlingus-montage that follows, showing candidate after candidate buried between her legs, is both hilarious and disturbing. Throughout, Maya remains self-centered, somewhat imperious, critical-thinking skills always in operation. It's not just that she's horny (although that's part of it.) It's more that she is looking for a man who embraces female power, who doesn't fear it. Cunnilingus skills (or lack thereof) is the perfect \"tell.\" Maya narrows down the candidates to two finalists: Ansel (Nathan Keyes) and Paul (Alexander Koch). Ansel is so shy he can barely speak above a whisper and seems chagrined that Maya is planning on suicide. He wants her to re-consider. Paul is a horse of a different color, a little bit older, arrogant, meeting Maya on her level. Paul is not easy to manipulate, so it's no wonder, then, considering what we have seen of Maya, that she is drawn to him. The film seesaws back and forth between quiet gentle Ansel and aggressive jerk Paul, somewhat tiresomely pitting them against one another. Advertisement There's an unbalanced effect here. Olin is better than the film she's in, and she dominates the other actors onscreen. She can't help it. The scenes with her shotgun-toting off-the-grid next door neighbor (Rosanna Arquette) are fantastic. The two women crawl into the motorboat that sits out in the middle of the woods, and drink vodka, talking about life, death, the world. Two cultural outlaws who have rejected the world's standards, maintaining their own course, however inexplicable to outsiders. These scenes have an untrammeled quality lacking in the rest of the film. In 1988, American audiences were introduced to Lena Olin in Philip Kaufman's film adaptation of Milan Kundera's \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being.\" In one famous scene, Olin, wearing black lacy underwear and a black derby, crawled on top of a full-length mirror lying flat on the floor, glancing up at her lover through the reflection. Olin was a powerful and unashamed erotic presence, spiked with intelligence, humor, knowingness. She was in ownership of her sexuality, which is why she was able to be so playfully performative with it. Kundera devotes pages of his book to that black derby, the sexual permission it symbolized. It's decades later now, and that scene still lingers like an afterimage. Nominated for an Academy Award for her beautiful performance in \"Enemies: A Love Story,\" she is probably known by a younger generation for her recurring role in \"Alias.\" (Most recently, she appeared in one memorable scene in David Fincher's Netflix series \"Mindhunter.\") Despite my quibbles with the structure of \"Maya Dardel\"'s story, its unnecessary leashing itself to the \"contest\" between two candidates, the film has much to recommend it, in particular its lack of sentimentality about suicide, art, womanhood. What are we to do with a talent as ferocious and as individual as Lena Olin? Where to \"put\" her? She's a natural star, in the most old-fashioned sense of the word. If the world were just, the industry would have already figured her out, would have realized that she always belongs at the center of things. Cotler and Zyzak are to be applauded for creating a space where Lena Olin can roam free. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Black Balloon", "Review": "At the center of \"The Black Balloon\" is Toni Collette's performance as the mother of an autistic son. The way she meets this challenge opens a way to understand all the other characters. Her son Charlie can be sweet and lovable. He can also make life for his family all but unbearable. Collette, as his mother, Maggie, has been dealing with him for 17 years and seems to have long ago made her peace with the fact that Charlie is who he is and is not going to change. As his mother, she loves him. The film is concerned largely with how her other son, Thomas (Rhys Wakefield), exists with his brother. Tom is a military brat, used to new towns and new schools, affable but shy. He shares the burden of Charlie (Luke Ford), cares for him, loves him but is ashamed of him. Thomas is at just that point in adolescence when he's acutely conscious of all his defects, and in teenage social terms, Thomas is a defect. Advertisement In an acutely embarrassing scene, Thomas is revealed during a swimming class as a 16-year-old who cannot swim. This makes him a target for other students, who like many teenagers are quick to mock. One girl is nice to him. This is Jackie (Gemma Ward), a tall blond who quietly makes it clear that she likes Thomas. Thomas doesn't really know how to deal with this, but his first instinct is to try to hide Charlie from her. And a crisis is building at home; his mom is pregnant again; his dad, Simon (Erik Thomson), insists on bed rest for her, and when Simon is away, the burden of running the household falls on Thomas. \"The Black Balloon\" establishes this family with a delicate mixture of tenderness and pain. Charlie is not made into a cute movie creature. He cannot speak, he cannot control his rages, he can have instant, violent mood changes. He runs through the neighborhood in his underpants. He throws a tantrum in a supermarket. He rubs his feces into the carpet. Thomas is supposed to protect Charlie from himself, and perform the damage control. The story elements of \"The Black Balloon\" could have been manipulated to make the film false and cute. In some circles, that would be interpreted as upbeat. The film tries to be true. The uplift comes in how the family, and Jackie, respond to Charlie. Maggie and Simon are strongly bonded in a marriage that has survived Charlie. They have no time for nobility; they are focused on doing what needs to be done. Charlie is theirs, and will not be stored in a \"facility.\" Thomas agrees with this, but he has a breaking point. It is Jackie who turns out to be special. Although Gemma Ward, who plays her, is a well-known model, and this is her first substantial role, there is nothing of the professional model in her performance. She creates a spontaneously warm young woman who cares for Thomas, sympathized with him, accepts Charlie without question, and helps Charlie accept -- himself. Luke Ford's performance as Charlie is a convincing tour de force. You may recall him as Brendan Fraser's heroic son in \"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.\" Rhys Wakefield, in his first feature role, is a good casting decision, suggesting inner turmoil without overacting. Advertisement But it is Toni Collette who explains, without even seeming to try, why this family is still together at all. Elissa Down, who directed and co-wrote the film, reportedly has two autistic brothers. Her experience informs this story, particularly in the way enormous pressure is brought to bear on the family. Perhaps she wrote from experience about how the two parents begin with unconditional love; how rare to see a happy, long-surviving marriage in a movie, where so often the father is flawed. Rare, too, and a tribute to the Australian film industry, to see a film that doesn't allow star power to compromise its vision. The mainstream cinema would no doubt be eager to employ Gemma Ward in a no-brainer teeny romcom. She made the right choice here, and seems poised to follow the example of another onetime model, Nicole Kidman, in treating herself seriously and not getting lost in the soul-deadening life of a professional model."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Daybreakers", "Review": "Ten years in the future, a global epidemic has infected most of the population with vampirism. The few remaining humans are on the run, hunted down by the militant Vampire Army, which doesn't hate them but mostly is just hungry. This depletion of the planet's food supply might be an opening for a parable about our dwindling resources, but no: Instead of making the humans a breeding stock for blood harvesting as practiced by the giant Bromsley Marks Corp., the army members eat them. Al Gore must have a chart showing how that's self-defeating. Advertisement Bromsley Marks is a major supplier of human blood, but is spending a fortune to develop a synthetic blood substitute. Like so many big companies in agribusiness, it wants to wean us off that healthy organic food and sell us a substitute, no doubt sweetened by corn syrup. BM's chief hematologist is Edward (Ethan Hawke), who like some of the atomic scientists at Los Alamos feels guilty about his work. He pushes for a cure for vampirism, not just a handy new product. That sets the stage for this grave new world where life is designed to be lived at night. Underground moving walkways replace sidewalks, curfew starts before dawn, and so on. Edward has ethics and believes it is wrong to exploit comatose humans for their blood. He's one of those damned lefties who years ago probably was against eating beef. He's a vampire with a conscience. Edward hooks up with the human underground, notably the cute Audrey (Claudia Karvan), and is introduced to Lionel, code name Elvis (Willem Dafoe), who has a cheap and easy vampirism antidote but is being hunted by Edward's hothead brother Frankie (Michael Dorman), because -- I dunno. Because Frankie's not about to give up blood for a healthier lifestyle, I guess. The movie, directed by Australia's twin Spierig brothers (\"Undead,\" 2003), looks good in its gray sunless scenes evoking twilight (cough). The newspapers and TV anchors report on hopes for a vaccine, apparently because the constant demands of vampirism maintenance are a grind. Imagine if the price of blood was beyond the pocketbook of the average family of four, and you had to go out human-hunting every day to feed the kids. A homeless person holds up a cardboard sign: \"Hungry. Will work for blood.\" This intriguing premise, alas, ends as so many movies do these days, with fierce fights and bloodshed. Inevitably, the future of the planet will be settled among the handful of characters we've met, and a lot of extras with machineguns. I guess, but can't be sure, that audiences will enjoy the way these vampires die. They don't shrivel up into Mr. and Mrs. Havisham but explode, spraying blood all over everyone. Toward the end, their heads blow off like human champagne corks. Well, not human."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Ch\u00e9ri", "Review": "Near the beginning of Colette\u2019s novel Ch\u00e9ri, she gives her young lover a necklace with 49 pearls. We can imagine there is one pearl for every year of her age. Her lover is 24 years younger than she. Therefore, 25. Six years pass. In a way, the movie \"Ch\u00e9ri\" is about how 25 and 49 are not the same as 31 and 55. Colette tells us their tragedy is they were destined to be the only perfect love in each other\u2019s lives, yet were not born on the same day. The success of Stephen Frears\u2019 film \"Ch\u00e9ri\" begins with its casting. Michelle Pfeiffer, as Lea de Lonval, is still a great beauty, but nearing that age when a woman starts counting her pearls. Rupert Friend, as her lover Ch\u00e9ri, is 27 and looks younger \u2014 too young to play James Bond, although he was considered. They are both accomplished actors, which is important, because \"Ch\u00e9ri\" tells a story of nuance and insinuation, concealed feelings and hidden fears. Advertisement Lea is a courtesan, currently without court. She has a lot of money and lives luxuriously. Ch\u00e9ri is the son of a courtesan, Charlotte Peloux (Kathy Bates). She and Lea have been friends for years; courtesans may be rich and famous, but they cannot really talk freely with women not like themselves. Lea was constantly in the life of her friend\u2019s son, named Fred but called Ch\u00e9ri (\"darling\") by one and all. One day, Madame Peloux comes to her and asks her to take in the boy. She does not quite say (as Lee Marvin tells a whore in \"Paint Your Wagon\") \"I give you the boy. Give me back the man,\" but she might as well have. Ch\u00e9ri is far from a virgin, but he needs some reining in. It turns out he accepts Lea\u2019s saddle quite willingly. What begins as lovemaking quickly becomes love, and they float in a perfumed world of opulent comfort, Lea paying all the bills. The two things a courtesan cannot ever do are really fall in love and reveal what she is really thinking. Lea fails at the first. You need not be told what happens in the story, or how thoughtless and cruel Ch\u00e9ri can be when it suits him. Be content to know that Lea knows sooner and Ch\u00e9ri later that what they had was invaluable and irreplaceable. Ch\u00e9ri became Colette\u2019s most popular book because of its air of describing familiar lives with detached regret, and that is the tone Frears goes for: This is not a tearjerker, but a record of what can happen when people toy with their hearts. How well I remember that day in 1983 when I walked across Blackfriar\u2019s Bridge in London and came upon an obscure little used book shop and inside discovered a set of the works of Colette, small volumes, bound in matching maroon leatherette, with cloth bookmarks. I have been in awe of her writing ever since. When Donald Richie, the great authority on Japanese cinema, was moving to a smaller flat in Tokyo and had to perform triage on his library, he gave away Shakespeare, because he felt he had internalized him, but could not bring himself to give away Colette. Advertisement Colette, who was 81 when she died in 1954, is probably best known to you as the author of Gigi. After leaving an unfaithful first husband, Colette, already a successful author, supported herself as a music hall performer, knew many courtesans in the era of La Belle Epoque, had affairs with women, shocked tout le monde with the first onstage kiss between two women, married the editor of Le Matin and was divorced at 51 after she had an affair with his 20-year-old stepson. So Ch\u00e9ri is not entirely a work of the imagination. Colette\u2019s many books are considered difficult to film because much of what happens is based on emotions rather than events. This is a challenge Frears and his screenwriter, the British playwright Christopher Hampton, have accepted. The film is about how to behave when you live at a distance from your real feelings. It is fascinating to observe how Pfeiffer controls her face and voice during times of painful hurt. It is bad to feel pain, worse to reveal it; a courtesan has her pride. The performances seem effective to me, including Bates as Charlotte, who like many an older prostitute plays a parody of her profession. Laugh, and the world laughs with you. The cinematography by Darius Khondji and costumes by Consolata Boyle are meticulous in evoking decadence. The most emotional moments at the end occur off-screen and are related by the narrator (Frears himself). That is as it should be. Some things don\u2019t happen to people. They happen about them."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Elvis & Nixon", "Review": "The most requested image in the U.S. government's National Archive is a photo of President Richard Nixon with the increasingly isolated rock star Elvis Presley, who visited the Oval Office on December 21, 1970 to ask to be made a Drug Enforcement Agent. Nobody but Elvis and Nixon were privy to the details of what the two men talked about behind closed doors, which of course makes their meeting a rich subject for comedy and drama. \"Elvis & Nixon\" treats it as a chance to think about loneliness, the way that the media-constructed image tends to swallow up famous people's actual personalities, and how accomplished men express their fears when they wield whatever power they've accumulated.\u00a0 Advertisement Unfortunately, the result is only fitfully entertaining or illuminating. The actual meeting of Elvis and Nixon takes up a very small part of the movie's running time. The bulk of the story follows Elvis (Michael Shannon) as he tries to get into the White House unannounced and Nixon (Kevin Spacey) as he waves off advisers who try to convince him that meeting with the King of Rock 'n' Roll would help him with the \"youth vote.\" None of the supporting characters (in Elvis' entourage and on Nixon's staff) are as compelling as the title characters, and the film's attempts to flesh them out prove frustrating because who cares, really, about the girlfriend problems of Elvis' best friend, or the interoffice politics of the West Wing when you could be watching American history's most venal, insecure and paranoid president commiserate with a musical superstar who shares his fear that the country is on a slide-trough to Hell? We get a bit of insight into Elvis' feelings of alienation and despair, but there's not enough of it to make this film's Elvis seem like more than an underdeveloped vehicle for social satire and bleak psychological comedy. By the 1970s, Elvis' movie career was dead, his country-gospel recordings hadn't caught on with younger fans who were enamored with the Beatles and the Stones and Jimi Hendrix and other psychedelically-flavored rockers, and he'd failed to capitalize on the success of his \"Elvis '68\" TV special, which a lot of people thought would signal a powerful new phase in his career. The Elvis we meet here carries himself like a defeated man. He plays casino shows for die-hard fans and frets that he's become a cartoon version of himself. One of the more effective scenes finds the King standing in front of a mirror, telling his best friend Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer) that Elvis and \"Elvis\" bear little relation to each other anymore, and he no longer feels connected to his roots as a poor Memphis redneck. Not even his old buddies can assuage his feelings of estrangement; they love him, in their way, but there's no denying that they also love being able to say they're friends with Elvis, that they live in his house and help themselves to his groupies, that he's bought them clothes and cars.\u00a0 Michael Shannon does a better job of filling in all these details than the film does. A master of stylized suggestions, he's one of the greatest living American actors, a performer who comes at every character from a series of unexpected angles. Watch the way he inclines his head, the way he punctuates his statements with finger-snaps and karate moves and hand-waves that suggest a priestly blessing (or a Jedi master trying to halt an enemy in his tracks). He pitches his voice higher than a typical impersonator would, a choice that makes you think of Elvis as an overgrown Little Boy Lost. There are moments when Elvis seems to be giving a performance as Elvis, the costumed musical superhero, because the real guy was subsumed by him many years ago. Shannon doesn't really look like the real Elvis, but it doesn't matter. Like Anthony Hopkins in \"Nixon\" and Denzel Washington in \"Malcolm X,\" he's not doing an impression. He's performing an\u00a0idea\u00a0of a real person, with such warmth and intelligence that you feel as though you understand Elvis more completely. Advertisement Nevertheless, I suspect the character won't fascinate anyone who isn't already an Elvis buff, because the movie's script (credited to three people) and direction (by Liza Johnson) treats the buildup to Elvis's White House visit as a series of sketch comedy-like moments that err on the side of cute and wacky. This is partly a pacing and structure issue, but it also comes from an evident failure of nerve. The film is by its nature a drawn-out, deadpan comedy, and in its quieter moments it absolutely nails that vibe, but the toodle-oodle faux-blues score (by Ed Shearmur) keeps chiming in, sometimes blaring in your ear, reassuring you that everyone onscreen is lovable and the whole story is just adorable as all get-out.\u00a0 Kevin Spacey cedes the film to Shannon, which is for the best when you compare his performance and his costar's. Spacey is an Orson Welles-Laurence Olivier kind of actor, wickedly funny and big by default. He does an accurate, amusing Nixon impersonation (Spacey is one of the best impressionists alive, in fact\u2014and a great talk show guest for that reason) but he's given even less to work with here than Shannon. This movie's version of Nixon is an impatient, surly, out-of-touch boss who just happens to be Richard Nixon and share Richard Nixon's political values.\u00a0 It's only in the handful of moments when Nixon and Elvis face each other in private that we get that electric crackle of big personalities clashing. When the characters jockey to control a particular moment, the film momentarily becomes as incisive and startling as you want it to be, as when Elvis helps himself to a bowl of M&M's that he's been warned are only for Nixon, or when Elvis tells the president that the letter he scrawled in a child's handwriting and delivered to the president was written on a plane from Los Angeles. \"I can tell,\" Nixon deadpans.\u00a0 Advertisement This story was told with more flair in the 1997 Showtime TV movie \"Elvis Meets Nixon,\" directed by Allan Arkush of \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" fame, and it's probably to the filmmakers' benefit that Arkush's movie is so difficult to see these days. It had an exuberant goofy quality, bordering on \"Doonesbury\"-style political satire, that's ultimately more compelling than this movie's shambling, pokey attempts to caricature and humanize Nixon and Elvis at the same time.\u00a0 The movie is worth seeing, though, for Shannon's performance, in particular a monologue about the singer's twin brother, who arrived in the world stillborn 45 seconds before Elvis. It's hard to describe the power of this scene without seeming as if I'm overselling it, but when you see it you'll know why I mentioned it. It's everything \"Elvis & Nixon\" could have been but for some reason chose not to be. It shows us the real man beneath the suits and flared trousers and garish belt buckles and rings\u2014the boy who was blessed to be given the luck of two brothers, but would rather have just had a brother."}

There\u2019s a special cinema subgenre that caters to moviegoers like me,\r\nthe foodie movie. Films like \u201cBabette\u2019s Feast\u201d and \u201cBig Night\u201d represent the\r\nhigh-water mark, while the recent Bradley Cooper vehicle \u201cBurnt\u201d\r\nlanguished near the bottom. \u201cSweet Bean\u201d falls somewhere in the middle, though\r\nit gets extra points for evoking memories of \u201cBig Night's\" classic\r\nomelette-making final scene. Sentaro (Masatoshi\r\nNagase) runs a small dorayaki shop, where he cooks the pancake-based snack for\r\na small group of schoolgirls who frequent the establishment. Dorayaki are a\r\nsandwich-like treat made of two pancakes held together by a large dollop of an, the sweet bean paste of the title. Sentaro\r\nrises early to create the perfectly shaped tiny pancakes he uses for his dorayaki.\r\nAny rejects that do not meet his criteria become \u201cdiscards\u201d that he hands out\r\nfor free.

A 50-year veteran of making dorayaki, Tokue\r\noffers up a valid criticism: the pancakes are good, but the an is sub-par.

It\u2019s a long process\r\nthat, like \"Sweet Bean,\" requires more patience than most would be willing to\r\ngive.

By itself, it would make an excellent stand-alone short film.\r\nThe arduous process of cooking an\r\npays off when Sentaro\u2019s new, improved dorayaki quickly become a\r\nlines-around-the-block success due to word of mouth. Word of\r\nmouth is also the catalyst for the film\u2019s dramatic conflict, which I\u2019ve\r\npurposely avoided discussing until now. This plot development is not really\r\nnecessary, as \"Sweet Bean\" could have framed its message of tolerance within\r\nthe confines of the store and the personal dynamics of the three generations\r\nrepresented by Wakana, Tokue and Sentaro. By adding a secret life for Tokue\r\n(which the film reveals early on, but I\u2019ll not spoil) and a tragic final\r\nsection, \u201cSweet Bean\u201d makes a blatant leap for the heartstrings that feels too heavy-footed\r\nfor its delicate construction. Admittedly, some of these scenes are moving, but\r\noften the sentiment feels laid on as thick and chunky as Tokue\u2019s bean paste.  Kawase\r\nfavors close-ups and medium shots of her actors and the action, creating an\r\nintimacy upon which her lead actors thrive. Kiki, Uchida and Nagase bring a\r\nwealth of subtle emotion to their thinly drawn characters, and it registers on\r\ntheir faces and in their body language. One scene in particular stands out, and if you blink you might miss it. When Tokue is offered the job, Kiki\r\nsilently plays this beautiful moment of fulfillment. She lights up with a\r\nnewfound sense of purpose, and in that brief instance, you know all you need to\r\nknow about her character\u2019s soul.  Advertisement Kawase\r\ndepicts the passage of time with beautifully shot changes of season, bookending\r\nthe film with the vivid cherry blossoms of Spring. When \u201cSweet Bean\u201d is\r\nleisurely coasting along like this, one can easily get lost in its meditative\r\npull. I found enough of that to forgive the film its trespasses. \u201cSweet Bean\u201d may\r\nbe as overly sweet as dorayaki, but like that treat, it hits the spot if that\r\nis what you crave. If you go to see it, take your Nana, because this film will make\r\nyou think of her."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Southbound", "Review": "There's almost nothing to most \"Tales from the Crypt\"-style\u00a0horror omnibus films. These portmanteau projects usually coast on the flimsy but deceptively adequate\u00a0charms of their superior segments, since all the mediocre stories must do is compare nicely with the other segments. That's the beauty of the omnibus film's short story format: to be good enough, all you need is good hook, whether it's a premise, memorable line, or\u00a0some decent special effects. I am a sucker for this type of low-stakes\u00a0entertainment, so it comes as no surprise that I enjoyed\u00a0\"Southbound,\" a clever, though characteristically\u00a0inconsistent, collection of five\u00a0narratively-related\u00a0short films about seedy\u00a0characters who discover they're trapped in Hell. \"Southbound\" has one killer segment, and then four that are totally OK. That's an\u00a0average ratio for these types of movies, as so many of their creators\u00a0take the abbreviated length\u00a0of their respective\u00a0shorts as an excuse\u00a0to slack off (as with the headache that is \"The ABCs of Death\"). Still, \"Southbound\" is a prime example of a horror omnibus film: even the weaker segments have\u00a0something to recommend them. Advertisement Since\u00a0\"Southbound\" succumbs to many of the usual pitfalls and pleasures of the horror omnibus format,\u00a0it's not surprising that the film's weakest segments are\u00a0its\u00a0first and last\u00a0entries.\u00a0The introductory short is OK since it only has \u00a0to set up the film's over-arching premise. Two men drive down an open stretch of deserted country road, trying to\u00a0frantically\u00a0escape floating wraiths that we can only see in the distance. A cornpone evangelical DJ (who else but indie horror filmmaker/icon\u00a0Larry Fessenden) warns listeners that they won't\u00a0leave the\u00a0brimstone-paved road that they're on without a fight. And each time the pair tries to move past a nondescript gas station, they wind up back where they started, while their tormentors keep catching up. This opening salvo has a\u00a0cute premise and fun low-budget special effects, a specialty of directing collective Radio Silence (\"Devil's Due\" and the last segment in \"V/H/S\"). Radio Silence also directs the last segment, which similarly has some good visceral jolts\u2014masked robbers attack a nuclear family at a road-side motel!\u2014and wraps\u00a0the film's over-arching narrative\u00a0up a little\u00a0too neatly (those hybrid\u00a0cactus/death's-head\u00a0wraiths from the first segment!). There's not much in either of Radio Silence's contributions, but there doesn't really need to be. These are only the moments when the film takes off and\u00a0touches back down to Earth.\u00a0 The\u00a0film's second entry\u2014its first real story\u2014is well-directed but conceptually\u00a0obvious. Three girls driving around in a lime-green Volkswagen bus\u00a0get a flat tire, and wind up hitching up with a creepy Ray Bradbury/Norman Rockwell-style family of \"old-fashioned,\" clean-living Satanists. You know that this family worships Lucifer\u00a0based on their cartoonishly menacing\u00a0behavior, like the way they worship their \"Master\" when they say before-dinner\u00a0Grace. Written and directed by newcomer Roxanne Benjamin, this entry\u00a0winks at viewers throughout and never goes anywhere you don't expect it to, thanks in no small part to constant references to a missing fourth girl that one of the\u00a0Mystery Van's owners may or may not have killed. But this is just the first leg of the film's trip, a kind of warm-up act. Skin-deep ambience and appreciably morbid humor\u2014like a weirdly addictive, albeit disgusting-looking \"roast\" that's served to the girls\u2014is enough when the segment doesn't demand much\u00a0more from audiences. Benjamin's segment does\u00a0thematically set-up the film's best short, which is\u00a0helmed and written by David Bruckner (one of the co-creators of clever anti-technology\u00a0omnibus film \"The Signal\"). This short, about a Good Samaritan who\u00a0attempts to save a badly-injured pedestrian he hit with his car while talking to his wife on his phone, is the only one disturbing\u00a0enough to be memorable outside of the film's omnibus context. He scrambles around a ghost town while listening to a sweet-sounding\u00a0EMT dispatcher, a concerned\u00a0911 operator, and a demanding\u00a0surgeon as they walk him through the steps of saving the severely\u00a0injured victim. Blood spurts, limbs crack, and incisions are made in pointedly grisly ways; the victim is treated like a human-shaped\u00a0nesting doll whose every layer is packed with gore and viscera. But again, while you know where Bruckner's segment is going,\u00a0he gets you there with unholy conviction and ghoulish panache. If you see \"Southbound,\" you should see it for this singular middle segment. The other four\u00a0stories\u00a0are all fine enough, and will give you a pleasant, albeit short, trip to a foregone destination. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Make Believe", "Review": "Oh, I wanted to be a magician. I memorized a biography of Houdini and mailed off to Johnson, Smith and Company for boxes that made coins disappear, trick card decks, and wands that contained weights to make tassels rise and fall. I ordered the neighborhood kids into the basement and staged a laborious performance by the Great Ebertini. Tassels rose and coins disappeared, but the cards needed more work. A lot more work, I learn in \"Make Believe.\" This is a charming documentary about the finalists in the Teenage Magician Contest at the annual World Magic Seminar in Las Vegas. From Malibu, Chicago, Colorado, Japan and South Africa they come, dreaming of being presented with first place by the great Lance Burton. The documentary visits their homes, gets their stories, talks to their friends and parents, and follows them backstage in Vegas. Advertisement But mostly it watches them practice, over and over and over. Hiroki Hara, who lives in Kitayama, Japan, uses the village hall and rehearses relentlessly all day, every day, mentioning that he grows lonely there all by himself, but his goal makes it worthwhile. The others practice, too, and one sheds a few tears when two coaches tell him he's not ready for the finals. He rehearses some more, and on the big day, he is ready and then some. Not a single rabbit is pulled from a hat. Most of the trucks are small scale: locking rings, disappearing scarves or card production. A deck of cards in their hands seems to have a life of its own. One kid turns cards into iPhones while the cards fanned between his fingers. We see him in his basement, building the props. Hara is the most inventive. He appears as a ghost monster with flashing green eyes and presents an elegantly choreographed act. Siphiwe Fangase and Nkumbuzo Nkonyana, from a township in Cape Town, are the most entertaining, with their act based on music, dance and magic soccer balls in honor of the World Cup held in South Africa. For one contestant, everything goes wrong. A ball drops during a ball production trick, and a trap in a hat doesn't work. It's not the magician's fault; both tricks always work. It's one of those days. The other contestants, backstage, discuss this with a kind of dread, knowing that no matter how often they practice, the same thing could happen to them. One question not really addressed by the movie is whether these kids are wise to skip classes and put social life and college on hold to focus singlemindedly on magic. Apparently they all think they'll find professional careers, maybe not in Vegas, but at conventions and so forth. I hope so. One thing we don't find out is how any of the tricks are done. The secrets in some cases (the steel rings, the vanishing scarves) are pretty widely known. In card manipulation, most of the people in the audience know in theory exactly how it's done, but are connoisseurs in judging how well they are performed. Magicians have a saying: \"The trick is told when the trick is sold. \" These kids are sold on tricks. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Simon and the Oaks", "Review": "Here is the story of two boys coming of age in two strangely combined families. Poetic, romantic and idealistic, it begins in 1939 and concludes after the end of World War II. It's not strictly speaking a Holocaust movie, although the dark cloud of that atrocity arches overhead. The setting of \"Simon and the Oaks\" is a Swedish coastal community, where we meet Simon (Jonatan S. Wachter), a dreamy young boy drawn to the solitude of an old oak, where in a tree house he devours books and is filled with ineffable longings. His parents, Karin and Erik (Helen Sjoholm and Stefan Godicke), are salt-of-the-earth types, his dad a master carpenter. Inspired by his books, Simon is drawn to enroll in the local school. His father opposes this, seeing it as a threat to the family.  Advertisement In the school, he meets a German Jewish boy named Isak (Karl Martin Eriksson), whose parents fled from the Nazis. His father, Ruben (Jan Josef Liefers), owns a bookstore in the town, and Simon regards with awe all the books he sees in its window. When a fellow student taunts Isak for being Jewish, Simon comes to his rescue and bloodies the bully's nose. Then Isak takes Simon home to meet his parents, who live in a luxurious flat above the store, filled with art and exuding sophistication. Keep these characters in mind. There is more to them than we suspect. We gradually discover that Karin and Erik are childless and raised Simon after he was born to his unmarried Aunt Inga (Cecilia Nilsson). Simon's father was a German Jewish violinist who had a romance with Inga, which was cut short by the war. So Karin and Erik may have notions about why Simon is drawn to music and a life of the mind. They invite Isak to come and live with them, as a refuge from anti-Semitic bullying at school. Subtly, the families merge, and it's clear Isak's father and Simon's mother are attracted to each other. Erik notices this, but exercises tactful restraint. He is compensated because Isak is as fascinated by Erik's boat building as Simon is by Ruben's bookselling. Each father gets a surrogate son. And both sons are targets for the Nazis. We may anticipate that the movie will advance slowly through the war and reach its climax that way, but no; unlike most movies involving the Holocaust, this one places the war's end at the halfway point and leaps ahead. Now the two young actors are replaced by older ones; Simon is played by Bill Skarsgard (Stellan's son), and Isak by Karl Linnertorp.  The oak tree is not forgotten, nor the images which young Simon imagined in the cloud formations above it. Ruben takes Simon to concerts, which transport him, and gives the boy a radio-phonograph, which fills the simple seaside home with music. Subplots involve illness and sexual initiation. The film is based on a Scandinavian best-selling novel by Marianne Fredriksson, and arrives bedecked by 13 Swedish nominations and two awards. It is unabashedly sentimental and epic, and rather bold in the way it takes place during and after the Holocaust but is not defined by it. The real story is of two unconventional families who help each other in a time fraught with danger. I was intrigued by the relationship of the two fathers, who arrive at an unspoken detente for the benefit of the two sons. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2", "Review": "The original \u201cMy Big Fat Greek Wedding\u201d was a fluke. A charming, warmhearted fluke, but a fluke nonetheless. It was broad and sitcom-y but it resonated with a wide array of moviegoers, despite the peculiarities of its cultural specificity, and it made a mind-boggling $369 million worldwide in 2002. Fourteen years later, we have a sequel that it seemed nobody in particular was clamoring for, with a title that\u2019s as uninspired as the premise itself: \u201cMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 2.\u201d Yes, there is another big, fat, Greek wedding. Advertisement Whereas the first film worked mainly through the massive likability of its star/writer, Nia Vardalos, this sequel (which Vardalos also wrote) makes the mistake of relegating her to a supporting role in one of way too many interwoven subplots, none of which are particularly compelling. This time, Vardalos\u2019 sweetly self-deprecating Toula must manage the chaos that\u2019s thrust upon her from a multitude of members of her wacky family. In the most contrived of these dilemmas, it turns out that Toula\u2019s parents, Chicago restaurant owners Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan), aren\u2019t actually married after all. The priest back in Greece never signed their marriage certificate 50 years ago. This means there has to be\u2014you guessed it\u2014another big, fat, Greek wedding. But wait! Despite constantly harping on every young woman she meets about the importance of getting married, Maria begins to question whether she wants to be someone\u2019s wife anymore. And yet, we know from the title that this problem will be resolved, so there are no real stakes. At the same time, Toula is having a hard time maintaining the spark with her own husband, Ian (John Corbett, more milquetoast than ever), the WASP-y dude whose arrival in Toula\u2019s life created a culture clash in the first film. She\u2019s also devastated at the prospect of her 17-year-old daughter, Paris (Elena Kampouris), leaving home and heading off to college. Meanwhile, Paris suffers from her own romantic angst as she prepares for prom and tries to deflect the pressure to date a Greek boy. In one particularly embarrassing scene\u2014which is emblematic of director Kirk Jones\u2019 over-the-top tone throughout\u2014Paris\u2019 entire family shows up at her school\u2019s college fair to ensure that she stays in town and goes to Northwestern. They bring homemade spanakopita. They pressure the admissions representative. They mug wildly for group photographs. Over and over again, this is the level of humor in \u201cMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 2\u201d\u2014this is the shrill note it hits. It isn\u2019t enough to show that Toula\u2019s family is (supposedly) lovably embarrassing. Gags get piled upon gags with relentless frenzy and results that are overbearing rather than uproarious. You can rely on every character to behave exactly the same way every time, regardless of the situation, and that way is usually obnoxious. Even a character who comes out as gay\u2014which, in theory, should be an important moment\u2014arrives out of nowhere and carries zero emotional heft. And then every once in a while, John Stamos and Rita Wilson (a producer on the film once again) show up as husband and wife, ostensibly because they\u2019re Greek and they\u2019re doing due diligence. Advertisement The one figure we can rely on to shake things up through the sheer awesomeness of her bizarre presence is Second City veteran Andrea Martin as Toula\u2019s thoroughly inappropriate Aunt Voula. Just the choices in her facial expressions and vocal intonations are good for consistent laughs. And man, for those few moments, does it feel good to laugh. Vardalos\u2019 choices\u2014both on screen and behind the scenes\u2014aren\u2019t quite so easy to figure out. Ordinarily blessed with a pleasing accessibility and quick wit, here Vardalos has stripped this character she created of everything that made her endearing and turned her into a skittish, wound-up ball of codependency. Toula is a wife and a mother but more often behaves like a scared little girl as she spinelessly agrees to every whim and demand from her selfish, needy family. Her script is a mess, and no amount of Windex can clean it up."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "America the Beautiful", "Review": "The documentary \"America the Beautiful\" is not shrill or alarmist, nor does it strain to shock us. Darryl Roberts, its director and narrator, speaks mostly in a pleasant, low-key voice. But the film is pulsing with barely suppressed rage, and by the end, I shared it. It's about a culture \"saturated with the perfect,\" in which women are taught to seek an impossible physical ideal, and men to worship it. \"America the Beautiful\" opens with shots of a pretty girl named Gerren Taylor, who looks terrific in the skimpiest of bikinis and draws admiration at a topless pool party, although she keeps her top on. Gerren is 12. Her life as a fashion model began when a woman handed her a card for a modeling agency. She is tall, has a good figure and a model's \"walk,\" and an ambitious mother named Michelle. Advertisement Roberts, a Chicago native, will follow her career in a film that's also a general look at the media-driven worship of women who the average woman may never resemble (or, if they have any sense, feel the need to). To establish the world Gerren enters, he calmly assembles facts and observations: (1) \"Three minutes of looking at a fashion magazine makes 90 percent of women of all ages feel depressed, guilty and shameful,\" (2) three years after the introduction of television to the Fiji Islands, the culture's rate of teenage bulimia went from zero to 11 percent, (3) a model who is 6 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds is told she must lose 15 pounds, (4) the \"average woman\" in those crypto-feminist Dove soap ads became \"average\" only after complex makeup and photo retouching. Roberts watches as Gerren becomes, for a season, a sensational success. Her appeal is based largely on her age. Celebrity magazines are fascinated by a 12-year-old who models adult fashions, and she conquers Fashion Week in New York. But a year later, her novelty has worn off, she is rejected by the same casting directors who selected her earlier, and, after learning her hips are \"too wide\" for Milan, she and her mother seek success in London and Paris. After becoming a cover girl and overnight sensation, Gerren and her mom, who seem to live prudently, are essentially broke. Yes, she gets paid in London: She gets to keep the clothes she wears. Their quest leads to an unsettled personal life for the young girl. During an argument with her mother over wearing a padded bra to school, Gerren sobs that her mom is ruining her high school years, but those years are impacted in ways she doesn't yet understand. Her sensible Los Angeles middle-school principal finds she has become a classroom problem and asks her to sign a \"Behavior Contract.\" Insulted, Michelle moves her daughter to a more \"understanding\" school in Santa Monica, and finally opts for home schooling. Advertisement Talking to models about the profession that drives them to starvation, Roberts is tentative and quiet as he asks things like, \"Do you ever think this might have an impact on your ... health?\" The one time his voice lifts in anger is after a photographer fights with an African-American woman who refuses to wear makeup that will lighten her skin by four or five shades. Roberts, black himself, listens incredulously as the photographer berates the model for being ignorant, \"unable to listen\" and \"knowing nothing\" about beauty, fashion and society. The \"problem\" of the model's dark skin tone is simply one manifestation of the \"problems\" all women are told they have if they don't match the fashion ideal. Roberts knows women like the model and the photographer doesn't, but as the man with the camera, the photographer ordains himself with authority. Roberts has a powerful message in \"America the Beautiful,\" but he includes too much material not really necessary for his story. We could have done without his own experiences on a Web site named beautifulpeople.net, where applicants are rated on a sliding scale to discover if they're beautiful enough to qualify. We don't need still more standard footage of Paris Hilton, Britney Spears and other plastic creatures. Even more unnecessary is an interview with celebrity-gossip correspondent Ted Casablanca, whose four-letter language earns an R rating for a film that might rescue the lives of some girls age 12 and up. But \"America the Beautiful\" carries a persuasive message, and is all the more effective because of the level tone that Roberts adopts. The cold fact is that no one can look like a supermodel and be physically healthy. And in a film filled with astonishments, one of the most stunning is that designers like their models the skinnier the better, because -- are you ready for this? To save money on the expensive fabrics they use."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Blackthorn", "Review": "There is a list of people whose deaths remain \"unresolved.\" Jimmy Hoffa. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Judge Crater. Amelia Earhart. B. Traven. They all must be dead by now anyway, but we have a need for closure. Such cases also provide an excellent inspiration for movies. The test of these movies is simple enough: If they were about fictional people, would they be worth seeing? Sometimes the answer is yes, as in several tales about the alleged later life of Sherlock Holmes. I know, I know, he was never alive in the first place, but give me a break here. In the case of Butch and the Kid, how many people had even heard of them before the 1969 movie? In it there was the possibility that they escaped to Bolivia, and that's where \"Blackthorn\" joins Butch in old age, circa 1928. Advertisement Played by Sam Shepard, who may be the most photogenic of modern playwrights, he inhabits an isolated horse ranch in a severe landscape and shares the company of the comely Yana (Magaly Solier). But memories of past glory fill him with thoughts about a return to America, where a son may live, who would be his child with Etta Place \u2014 or with the Kid, if you follow me. He cashes in all his money and sets off across the Bolivian vastness on horseback, where he's waylaid by Eduardo (Eduardo Noriega) a mining engineer. Butch's net worth was stashed in the saddlebags of his horse, which runs away, making him rather hard to steal from. Butch knows that this Eduardo may have stolen the fortune of a local millionaire, and Eduardo leads him on what is possibly a wild goose chase down into the abandoned mine where it's perhaps hidden.  What Edurardo needs is protection from the millionaire's men, who are following him. Meanwhile, they're trailed by a man who is either the most stubborn or the most foolish of Pinkerton agents, Mackinley (Stephen Rea), who has allegedly been tirelessly tracking Butch for 20 years.  This story is well-acted by Sam Shepard, who I have never seen unconvincing. There's a dash of Kris Kristofferson in his performance, as when he ambles through the country singing rusty old songs like \"Sam Hall.\" (\"Damn your eyes!\") The cinematography is breathtaking; we rarely see Bolivia in Western-style films, and the way it looks here might have persuaded John Ford to move on from Monument Valley. But the movie as a whole isn't much. Flashbacks to the good old days, with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Padraic Delaney standing in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford, are unconvincing and without much purpose, and given the moral twistiness of the original story, this rehash seems to lack purpose. Butch has grown old? And homesick? And gets waylaid, and is back in action again? Was this trip necessary?  The first-time director is Mateo Gil, known for the screenplays of \"Open Your Eyes,\" \"The Sea Inside\" and \"Agora.\" Ironic, that the film's weakness is its screenplay. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Way Back", "Review": "Not every incredible story makes a compelling movie. \"The Way Back\" is inspired by a 4,000-mile foot journey that began with an escape from a Siberian prison camp in the dead of winter and continued across Mongolia and the Gobi Desert, ending finally months later in free India.  At every moment this is astonishing. Mongolia itself was said to be a prison because no one was thought able to walk out of it. Starvation is a daily possibility. So are injuries, disease, death by exposure or capture by locals eager to collect a reward. Thirst and sun are nearly fatal in the desert. The travelers have only the clothes on their backs. We know some of them reached India, because the saga opens with that news. Advertisement But how did they possibly do that? Just as we're told: by walking. Walking and walking. And there lies the weakness of Peter Weir's film, which is nobly staged and has breathtaking cinematography but frankly, not enough of a story in the vulgar populist sense. Desperation and exhaustion make it difficult for the trekkers to work up much in the way of characters or conflicts, and while that no doubt spares us many cliches, we are left during their long walk with too much of a muchness. The group is often so bearded and weathered that members seem interchangeable. Two who stand out are Ed Harris an American, who claims his name is only \"Mr. Smith,\" and Colin Farrell as Valka, a Russian. (Has Harris ever given a bad performance?) The group is led by Jim Sturgess as Janusz, who's had the idea for the escape. Along the way they meet Irene (Saoirse Ronan), a young Polish woman. Her presence does not inspire romantic rivalries among the men. It's that kind of film. Peter Weir is a master filmmaker (\"Picnic at Hanging Rock,\" \"The Year of Living Dangerously,\" \"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\"). His cinematographer Russell Boyd works both in tight quarters and with astonishing vistas at the roof of the world. The film is a visual feast. I am far from sorry I saw it. But along with characterization, there is one area in which it seems to be lacking: details of survival. How exactly did they survive death by exposure in subzero Mongolia? Why didn't some of their meat spoil? Where did they find water in the desert? How did their footwear hold up \u2014 and why, as prisoners, did they have boots? The answer, I fear, is that although \"The Way Back\" is described on its poster as \"inspired by real events,\" it is fiction. The saga was first told in a book by Slavomir Rawicz, which was a European best-seller. But IMDb reports: \"In 2006, the BBC unearthed records (including some written by Rawicz himself) that showed he had been released by the USSR in 1942.\" There is an irony here. The film exhibits an admirable determination to do justice to a real story, but the story's not real. There's quite an op-ed debate going on right now between those (Neal Gabler) who say the cultural elite is finally being shouted down by populists and vulgarians, and others (A.O. Scott) who say such categories are meaningless. You like movies according to your own tastes.  Some people have bad taste and others have taste more like mine. Yet my taste is large. It contains multitudes. There is room for vulgarity, if it's well done. It's a shame to say so, but perhaps it would have helped \"The Way Back\" if Peter Weir had relaxed his standards slightly, slipped in some dramatic conflict and made better use of that pretty Polish girl.

As in, you\r\nactually do wonder what these two people really are to each other. But when\r\nJohn makes a pit stop with some sharks who\u2019ve got hooks in him, the exposition\r\ngets pretty dull: \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your protection,\u201d John laconically protests\r\nto one weasel. Weasel Number Two helpfully explains, \u201cYeah, but you took it.\r\nYou knew jail coulda been dangerous for you, John.\u201d Jail. Dangerous. Imagine.  Soon enigmatic flashbacks-within-flashbacks provide further\r\n\u201cclues,\u201d John keeps heedlessly putting Louis in harm\u2019s way as he goes about\r\nlooting and shooting, and during moments of respite John tries to impart wisdom\r\nto Louis. \u201cLook at that piece of ass,\u201d he says of a drive-in restaurant\r\nwaitress (see, I wasn\u2019t kidding about Faded Americana). He then advises Louis\r\nthat nothing on this earth is more deadly than a \u201cscorned woman.\u201d Never occurs\r\nto the guy that regularly referring to women as pieces of ass might go a long\r\nway to soliciting their scorn, but hey.  As John and Louis keep losing the cars they steal, John hits\r\nupon the idea of traveling with a tough single mom and her teen daughter. This team, featuring Lynn Collins and Emma Fuhrmann livens things up, but\r\ninsufficiently. By the time you\u2019re meant to learn just what the tie is between John and Louis, you\u2019ve stopped caring. But, thanks to the excellent if a\r\nlittle on the obviously-pictorial-side cinematography by Robert Barocci, you\u2019ve\r\nseen some lovely vistas on the way to indifference.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The End of the Tour", "Review": "Directed by James Ponsoldt (\"The Spectacular Now\"), \"The End of the Tour\" might fit well on a double bill with \"Amadeus,\" another film about a genius and a lesser artist who basks in his aura. Of course, the setting is very different, and the stakes are much lower\u2014\"Tour\" is a fictionalized account of the week-and-a-half that\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0writer David Lipsky spent following the late David Foster Wallace as he toured to promote his doorstop-sized masterpiece \"Infinite Jest\"\u2014but it's still the story of a competent but unremarkable creative person observing brilliance up close, feeding on it, reveling in it and resenting it.\u00a0 Advertisement It is also certainly one of cinema's finest explorations of an incredibly specific dynamic\u2014that of the cultural giant and the reporter who fantasizes about one day being as great as his subject, and in the same field. What it definitely\u00a0isn't\u00a0is a biography of David Foster Wallace, much less a celebration of his work and worldview. Whether that proves a deal breaker, a bonus, or a non-factor for viewers will depend on what they want out of this movie.\u00a0 \"The End of the Tour\" is not really about Wallace (Jason Segel), although he's the other major character. It starts with Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) expressing amazement (but really jealousy) over a rave review of \"Infinite Jest\" in\u00a0New York\u00a0magazine, a moment that sparks his obsession with Wallace. It ultimately leaves us thinking about Lipsky's feelings and career trajectory, and whether he feels any guilt about using his brief association with Wallace to further his own career as a writer of books. At this point in his life, Lipsky has had just one volume published, a novel that few people bought and fewer read; after some hesitation, he foists it on Wallace while visiting him at the University of Illinois during a punishingly icy winter.\u00a0 The screenplay by Donald Margulies spends most of its time and energy observing a dance. One dancer is Lipsky. He only got\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0to pay for his rock-star style profile of a novelist by agreeing to ask Wallace about the rumors that he uses heroin, and his motivations for doing the story are, to put it mildly, less than noble. The other dancer is Wallace. His fiction and nonfiction were partly concerned with the meaning of the word \"authenticity,\" and how the social rituals and technology and economic structure of modern life created false intimacies that Wallace was determined to reject.\u00a0 Theirs is a complex relationship, brief as it is. The most fascinating thing about it is how each side of it seems to be happening in a different storytelling genre.\u00a0 Wallace's side of the story is something along the lines of a light drama, perhaps even a romance, about somebody who's been burned over and over and has withdrawn from nearly all relationships save for a handful that he feels he can trust and believe in. Although the small part of the world that cares about writers' private lives thinks of Wallace as a bit of a recluse and perhaps a bit mysterious, it's immediately clear that he's just selective and self-protecting. It's the story of a man learning to trust again (in a love story, it would be \"to love again\") while worrying that he's going to get burned one more time. Lipsky isn't a Wallace-level intellect, he is very smart, and a good listener, and excellent at getting subjects to open up, even though his demeanor is presumptuous. He doesn't approach Wallace with the appropriate\u00a0 humility. He instead comes at him from the point-of-view of a writer who believes that he is Wallace's potential equal\u2014somebody as profound as Wallace but not as accomplished or famous, for now. Wallace seems to buy this. Why? Maybe because he's a teacher, and at least a few of his students have real talent, and he doesn't want his ego or insecurity to rule out the possibility that he might cross paths with an artist. Or maybe he's just a decent, optimistic guy. Advertisement Lipsky's side of the story often feels like the story of of a con man, or a regular person who uses other people without realizing that's what he's doing. If this were a romantic drama, Lipsky might be a drug user who swears he's gotten clean, or a recovering alcoholic who's not as far along in the process as he claims to be, or a serial cheater who wants everyone to think he's reformed and can be monogamous even though he's constitutionally incapable of that. We keep waiting for the other shoe to drop\u2014for Wallace, who genuinely likes Lipsky even though he's observant enough to spot all the warning signs immediately, to realize that Lipsky cannot have a real friendship with him, and that in general it is a bad idea for a subject to think that he can have that kind of relationship with a reporter.\u00a0 Any journalist who's been profiling famous people for any length of time will recognize the dynamic depicted here by Ponsoldt, Eisenberg and Jason Segel, and the honest ones will be made uncomfortable by it. There is something vampiric about features like the one that Lipsky has been assigned to write. There are also elements of theatricality. As Wallace observes early on, the subject is expected to give a performance of sorts, imitating the person he'd like to be perceived as being. The reporter in turn playacts casual curiosity, and tries to push past the facade and find something real, maybe uncomfortable, best of all revelatory.\u00a0 Segel and Eisenberg, who as movie stars have been in Wallace's position many times, have an intuitive understanding of how this relationship works, and they illuminate it in the moment, with specificity and clarity. Segel doesn't really look or sound like Wallace (not that that matters; Anthony Hopkins didn't look or sound like Nixon in \"Nixon\" but was extraordinary) and I didn't necessarily buy him as somebody who could write like Wallace, but he's so smart and genuine and peculiar that we believe he is capable of Wallace's extreme sensitivity and delicate observations\u2014a major accomplishment. Eisenberg is the true star of the movie\u2014an actor of extraordinary originality and also bravery, insofar as he never seems to trouble himself with whether people will hate his characters. He's a great listener but also a rather scary one. His characters often seem to be scrutinizing other characters the way a snake might scrutinize a field mouse. There are many moments in \"The End of the Tour\" when we dislike Lipsky. There are a few moments where we might find him sickening.\u00a0 Advertisement Is this a story that will fascinate an audience beyond editors, critics, reporters, novelists, and people who care about the problems of such people? I have no idea, though it seems unlikely; the film's incredible specificity would seem to mitigate against being discovered and championed by a wide audience, despite Segel and Eisenberg's presence in the cast. Did the film necessarily\u00a0need\u00a0to have David Foster Wallace as one of its two main characters? That's a thornier question. We rarely hear any of his prose read aloud (Lipsky reads a passage of \"Jest\" to his girlfriend, but that's about it) and there is nothing in the film besides some of Wallace's dialogue to indicate that the movie has any interest in illuminating Wallace's fiction, or the obsessions that he worked into them.\u00a0 It is very much an Amadeus and Salieri story, and if you are familiar with Amadeus, and the barest outlines of Wallace's life, and the fact that this is based on a nonfiction book by the writer David Lipsky, you know how the story must end: with Lipsky gaining a greater measure of fame via his brief association with Wallace and not being quite sure how to feel about it. The best thing you could say about \"The End of the Tour\" is that it could've been about any two creative people. That's also the worst thing you could say about it."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Enlighten Up!", "Review": "An unemployed journalist and a documentary filmmaker spend six months in traveling far enough to circle the globe and discover that the secret of yoga is the same as how to get to Carnegie Hall: practice, practice, practice. Apart from that, apparently, there is no secret at all to yoga. At least, they don\u2019t find a yogi who will admit to one. Kate Churchill and her subject, Nick Rosen, travel from New York to Boulder to California to Hawaii and then on to India. Nick practices under masters ranging from the legendary Yogacharya B.K.S. Iyengar, 91, named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world, to Diamond Dallas Page, named by Pro Wrestling Illustrated as the most hated wrestler of the year (1999). Advertisement All of these teachers, young and old, male and female, Eastern and Western, refuse to define or even really name the ultimate state one hopes to reach. When you get there, you will know it. You will find it within yourself. You just have to do it. Practice does not make perfection, but it makes improvement. One must not focus on the destination but on the journey. Live in the moment. Live in eternity. Find God. Let the body flow into a yoga position as light fills a diamond (Iyengar). Your reward will be T&A (Diamond Dallas). This was all fine with me, because I wasn\u2019t much interested in arriving at ultimate answers, and neither, it must be said, is Nick Rosen. He does, however, log a lot of miles, and has a particularly interesting time in India. He practices fervently. His body assumes positions on which, unlike a diamond, the sun don\u2019t shine. He begins as a skeptic about the spiritual side of yoga, ends the same way and doesn\u2019t find any yogis who try to proselytize him. Instead, they offer variations of: Just do it! Nick just does it, and at the end of his trial, he tells Kate that he feels good, sleeps better, is stronger, has an improved digestive system and in theory, a better sex life (in practice, he tells her: \u201cI haven\u2019t been alone with a woman for months \u2014 except you\u201d). \u201cEnlighten Up\u201d may prove a disappointment to anyone seeking to discover the secrets of yoga or have their own beliefs confirmed. Apparently it does all come down to practice. Some seem addicted to it, which seems a shame to me, because a discipline should be a path to a fuller life, not an alternative. If you spend the rest of your life practicing yoga, well, that\u2019s what you did with the rest of your life. It\u2019s healthier than sinning but that\u2019s about the best you can say. And yet this is an interesting movie, and I\u2019m glad I saw it. I enjoyed all the people I met during Nick\u2019s six-month quest. Most seemed cheerful and outgoing, and exuded good health. They smiled a lot. They weren\u2019t creepy true believers obsessed with converting everyone. They seemed happy with where they were and they assumed Nick wanted to be there, too. And for the most part, they seem to live contented lives, although Diamond Dallas promotes yoga as a way to meet chicks, and (a sharp shake of the wind chime, please) that man will never find tranquility who has not divested himself of subterfuge in meeting chicks. Advertisement Churchill\u2019s role is intriguing. At the outset, she tells us she\u2019s a yoga practitioner who thought there would be a documentary in recruiting a novice and exposing that person to yoga, then filming what happened. She obviously hopes Nick will take to yoga more than he does and sounds wistful in her off-camera questions. Is he beginning to find something more in it? Does he have a favorite teacher? Has his appreciation deepened? Nick is an affable man who goes along with her plan. Recently downsized, he has little better to do than be flown around the world to yoga experiences. But he\u2019s not cut out to practice, practice, practice, and he\u2019s so laid-back that few sparks fly. This is a peaceful kind of film, not terribly eventful, but I suppose we wouldn\u2019t want a yoga thriller. Relax. Let it happen. Or not."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "A Quiet Passion", "Review": "Terence Davies is ever a filmmaker in search of lost time. I do not believe he has ever made a feature film that is set in the present day, unless you count his 2008 documentary on his beloved hometown of Liverpool, \u201cOf Time and the City,\u201d a present day from which he mourned the past. This is not to say that Davies is any kind of nostalgia monger. In gazing at the past, he casts a cold eye on the oppression suffered by his characters, particularly his female ones. See his staggering 2000 adaptation of Edith Wharton\u2019s \u201cThe House of Mirth,\u201d starring Gillian Anderson, a near-surgical dissection of hypocrisy among the New York upper crust at the turn of the 19th century to the 20th. Also his 2011 \u201cThe Deep Blue Sea,\u201d filmed from a Terence Rattigan play, in which Rachel Weisz\u2019s Hester is trapped in a loveless marriage in post-World War II Britain. Advertisement \u201cA Quiet Passion,\u201d his latest film, goes back further in time than any of his past pictures, to the middle of the 19th century, and returns him to America, a place he has now visited three times in his filmography. (His 1995 film of John Kennedy Toole\u2019s novel \u201cThe Neon Bible\u201d was set in 1940s Georgia.) Working from his own original screenplay, \u201cA Quiet Passion\u201d treats the life and the work of the poet Emily Dickinson, whose vast body of work was mostly unpublished in her lifetime. The movie begins with young Emily (played by Emma Bell) keeping still in the middle of a chairless schoolroom as her fellow students move to the left or to the right, following the instructive questioning of a teacher who asks in just what way they desire to \u201ccome to God and be saved.\u201d Standing in the middle of the room Emily tells her teacher, \u201cI am not even awakened yet.\u201d Therefore, she asks, \u201cHow may I repent?\u201d We learn a little about how Emily acquired such seeming impudence. Her father, Edward, portrayed with solemnity and an unavoidable touch of wryness by Keith Carradine, is a lawyer with liberal proclivities and possessed of some religious skepticism, not exactly an au courant view in Amherst polite society. That said, he is also quite conventional in his views of women and their place, albeit surprisingly indulgent of his children at times. At supper with the now-adult Emily, played by Cynthia Nixon, he complains of a plate being dirty. Nonplussed, Emily picks up the plate and drops it to the floor, letting it shatter. She tells dad it is not dirty anymore. He actually seems amused.  The days of Amherst go by uneventfully enough at first. Emily whiles away the hours with her younger sister Vinnie (Jennifer Ehle) and best friend Vryling Buffam (Catherine Bailey). They stroll through gardens and go to teas and trade quips. Emily publishes a scant poem or two in a local journal run by a friend of her fathers. There are suitors and marriages\u2014for others. Emily is too outspoken, too disinterested, too Emily to do anything but be herself. And to write, mostly in secret. Davies does not view Dickinson as any kind of eccentric. Indeed, one feels that Davies strongly identifies with her. His dedication to his portrait is spectacularly evident in every shot of this very unusual movie. At first he presents his story and characters in the form of tableaus, like something out of a silent picture. The characters speak stiffly and stand as if posing. As the movie continues, and certain events that came to define America and its character\u2014particularly the Civil War\u2014touch the lives of the Dickinsons, and we hear more of Emily\u2019s work in voiceover, the movie\u2019s style becomes less constricted, more fluid, but still retains an unearthly quality. Just as Dickinson\u2019s poetic mode of personal expression and ear for idiosyncratic metaphor anticipated modernism, so here does Davies\u2019 cinematic style slip certain bonds and achieve an unquiet fluidity. The effect is remarkable.  Advertisement And it is grounded, and made most exemplary, by Cynthia Nixon\u2019s performance. Every actor in this movie is wonderful. But Nixon\u2019s precision in portraying every particular mood of Emily\u2014for each individual scene calls for absolute specificity\u2014is simply spectacular. There are points in Emily\u2019s life when she is racked by illness, or possessed by a seeming madness. Her fury at the misbehavior of a family member in one scene late in the film, as she rails against a perceived lack of integrity, is chilling because Nixon makes the viewer see the extent to which Emily is actually turning that rage back upon herself. Every scene in the movie contains a performance revelation of almost equal power. I will be very surprised if I see a better performance from an American actor this year.  \u201cA Quiet Passion\u201d is not suffused with the romantic ache or agony of some of Davies\u2019 other films. It does not mourn for what Emily Dickinson did not have. Rather it admires her for what she was, and what literary posterity made of her. And it invites the viewer to take seriously her mode of thought and of art; not just to take seriously, but to revel, inasmuch as one is able to revel in work that is simultaneously so austere and so rich. Like the movie itself."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Outsider", "Review": "After struggling to be taken seriously as the Joker in \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d and being the arguably least impressive component of \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d Oscar-winning actor Jared Leto has another big swing-and-a-miss with \u201cThe Outsider,\u201d available on Netflix today.\u00a0Contrasting the flair of those performances, Leto goes for a cold and calculated gang member, playing a former\u00a0WWII soldier in 1954 Osaka, Japan who gets caught up in the murderous business of the yakuza. But as the story bloats to two hours by\u00a0mistaking itself for an epic, \u201cThe Outsider\u201d falls into a pit of boredom somewhere between the white savior complex of Tom Cruise in \u201cThe Last Samurai\u201d and the much slicker kills by Alain Delon in \u201cLe Samourai.\u201d \u00a0 Advertisement Leto\u2019s character Nick finds himself in such an underworld after he helps save the life of a yakuza man named Kiyoshi (Tadanobu Asano), who offers him a home within the gang. With us still being unsure of why he is in a Japanese prison in the first place, Nick accepts the new life with\u00a0scant hesitation. It isn\u2019t long before Leto is able to robotically beat up people with their own typewriters or shoot them with the quickness of John Wick, all\u00a0under the tutelage of the Shiramatsu gang's aging boss\u00a0(Tin Manaka) who becomes like a father to him. As Nick becomes further legit in the yakuza world, referred to as gaijin\u00a0(\"outsider\")\u00a0every now and then by his new peers,\u00a0he also sparks up a love interest in\u00a0Kiyoshi\u2019s sister, Miyo (Shioli Kutsuna).\u00a0 Nick has a front seat to the growing turmoil between the Shiramatsu gang and the competing Seizu gang, whose turf war fails to create tension itself to the story. At first it\u2019s a disagreement over the\u00a0port of Osaka; later it\u2019s about a joint investment in radios. Genre fans will nonetheless get a few\u00a0gruesome kills after making it through these dull passages, but director Martin Zandvliet has little eye for action here, chopping up or flattening bursts of violence, robbing them of their explosiveness. \u201cThe Outsider\u201d proves to be even clumsy with brutality, aside from a scene where Nick and others ceremoniously, and disturbingly,\u00a0chop some of their fingers off, as in\u00a0one of \u201cThe Outsider\"\"s stone-faced presentations of yakuza rituals.\u00a0 \u201cJared Leto in a yakuza drama\u201d isn\u2019t the most palatable of pitches, but that somehow turns out to not be the movie's biggest problem. It\u2019s less the strangeness of stubbornly\u00a0inserting a white American into a world of Japanese men,\u00a0than it is how\u00a0this movie does very little with Nick's specific background to make the cringing idea worthwhile. As it starts, Nick\u00a0does have an odd, somewhat intriguing fish-out-of-water presence, but that angle is softened, aside\u00a0from seeing him being dismissed\u00a0often in English. \u201cThe Outsider\u201d could be about any random Japanese person who doesn't know how far the yakuza rabbit hole goes. But then \u201cThe Outsider\u201d wouldn\u2019t be a yakuza drama starring Jared Leto, which is just about all this project wants to be.\u00a0 Advertisement Still, casting Leto is not enough to fill in his very\u00a0empty character, who is left to be a huge\u00a0mystery for reasons that are themselves unknown. We get pieces of backstory about how he\u00a0left service sometime after World War II, thanks to a clumsy insertion of another American soldier played by Emile Hirsch. Skinny and monotone, Leto\u2019s take on a reserved\u00a0tough guy in a brutal underworld lacks the desired grittiness, even if he\u2019s doing something similar to Ryan Gosling in Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s \u201cOnly God Forgives.\u201d But when it comes to creating an arc, it\u2019s all\u00a0superficial, the way that he becomes very good with a samurai sword, or unflinchingly\u00a0ruthless as a yakuza. Even his Japanese skills go from not knowing the language to being able to hold his own in a conversation, without a sense of growth in between. Within the scope of \u201cThe Outsider,\u201d it\u2019s the equivalent to superheroes like Doctor Strange simply mastering their powers, instead of earning them through visible\u00a0hard work\u00a0(as Angelica Jade Bastien said in her review of that film).\u00a0 But take Leto out of the picture and you have an even less noteworthy movie, a\u00a0yakuza tale with an originality deficit. Zandvliet\u2019s idea behind constructing his take on the crime world\u00a0is to put a bunch of anonymous, scowling Japanese men in suits in desaturated rooms, and drag us through some yakuza-legitimizing rituals. But the non-Leto performances are reduced to plainly stoic, as the efficient likes of Asano or Tanaka aren't given thorough characters either, and in turn fail to\u00a0add some immediacy to \u201cThe Outsider\u201d\u2019s imploding third act of betrayal and bursts of violence.\u00a0They simply become servants tasked with\u00a0trying to legitimize this star vehicle, with everyone\u00a0pretending that \u201cThe Outsider\u201d is more than just the equivalent of a\u00a0yakuza melodrama."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Circumstance", "Review": "\"Circumstance\" begins as the story of two teenage Iranian girls in love, and if it had continued to focus on the impossibility of their relationship in everyday modern Tehran, I think it would have been more successful. Unfortunately, it strays into unlikely melodrama and distracting eroticism. Still, it is a bold statement about the treatment of women in the modern Islamic state. We meet Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and Shireen (Sarah Kazemy), two high school girls who share a big crush. This they keep secret from their families: Atafeh's, whose professional parents are conformist but not unkind, and Shireen's, who is being raised by her uncle after her dissident parents ran afoul of the clerical authorities. They frequent clandestine stores with Western videos, attend secret parties, smoke, dance and steal away to their bedrooms to share fantasies of the freedom they could experience in nearby Dubai. Advertisement Unfortunately, these fantasies are visualized all too sensuous\u00adly by writer-director Maryam Keshavarz, who uses light, color and music to suggest escapes that would have been more at home in an American lesbian romance. If the two teens had been more realistic, innocent and naive, I would have believed in them more. Then, at about the halfway point, a miscalculation arrives in the form of Atafeh's brother, Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai). Just returned from drug rehab, he is subjected to urine tests by their father, Firouz (Soheil Parsa), despite his protests that he is cured. So he seems to be, although his cure takes the form of an Islamist dogma that has turned him into much more of an extremist than anyone else in his family.  That this happened so quickly is a little unlikely. We sense something unwholesome about Mehran, who incredibly hides spy cameras in the family home to keep track of Atafeh and Shireen; his interest is more voyeuristic than liturgical. One senses here a half-realized ambition by the first-time filmmaker to emulate Hitchcockian motifs, but the film never organizes Mehran's peculiarities to a particular purpose. Firouz and wife Azar (Nas\u00adrin Pakkho) come across as reasonable parents, given their society, who want only a quick and safe marriage for their daughter. One day, Firouz takes the family to the beach, where he and Mehran go swimming, and he says to the women, \"one day we can all go swimming.\" The implication is that he regrets the prohibition of women in bathing suits, but observes it. The strongest message for most Western audiences will be the way the subjugation of women saturates every aspect of this society, and clearly informs even Mehran's kinkiness. Yes, but I wish Keshavarz had chosen a more low-key, everyday approach to two ordinary teenagers, and gone slowly on the lush eroticism and cinematic voyeurism."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "In Transit", "Review": "\"In Transit\" is a film about people riding a train from one place to another, talking about their lives with other passengers. That's all there is to it, and yet that's not all there is to it. The movie is a throwback to an earlier era of documentaries, when filmmakers did not feel obligated by commercial pressure to give their film the shape of a thriller, a sports film, a mystery or anything else, but instead simply brought their cameras into people's lives. The setting is the Empire Builder, an Amtrak train that journeys between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest, serving Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon as well as points in between; its route includes North Dakota, a new oil boom region that supplies many of this film's intriguing characters.\u00a0 Advertisement This film is nearly as welcome a breath of fresh air as my favorite film of 2016, Kirsten Johnson's \"Cameraperson,\" an autobiographical essay film made up of footage shot by a camerawoman over three decades, arranged in editing so that fragments of other people's lives explore universal concerns, such as war, trauma, childhood, parenting, illness, death, and the ethics of storytelling. \"In Transit\" is similarly supple and mysterious in the stories it tells and the points that it makes. And when it does make points, it never hammers them. It has a light touch, and many of the larger connections it draws are conveyed through editing, as when characters talk about the past that they left behind when starting over, and the movie cuts to a shot from the last car on the train, watching the rails recede into the distance. Considering that \"in Transit\" has no main character\u2014unless you count the train itself\u2014it is a remarkably coherent work. Clocking in at a brisk 75 minutes, it gives\u00a0us tantalizing glimpses into people's lives that suggest the totality of their experience while leaving us wanting more. This is my principal complaint about the movie\u2014it's a rare feature that might've benefited from a longer running time, because some of the characters' stories are interesting enough to linger on; at the very least, there are points where I wouldn't have minded if the filmmakers had stayed with one person for a couple minutes longer instead of cross-cutting between two or three stories.\u00a0 But the impulse to keep things moving relentlessly forward suits a film set on a train, and the people we do meet are consistently fascinating, even when we initially mistake them for merely eccentric or self-involved. We meet a mother and a daughter who bond by riding the rails, an immigrant woman who wants to see as much of her new country as possible, and a young man who's nervous about meeting a woman he courted from afar for many years. A very pregnant woman has a long conversation with an older man who keeps taking pictures through the windows, documenting his trip; we don't learn his story until much later, and it's so moving that I'd rather not spoil it here.  Advertisement \"In Transit\" is also a rare American film that gives us a sense of the richness of this country, both geographically and in terms of life experience. While the passenger manifest is predominantly white\u2014unsurprisingly, considering the states that the train is passing through\u2014there are passengers of many other races and ethnicities, as well as a variety of social classes, including many working class people who are either coming from oil fields or headed there. A series of scenes in the film's midsection lets us eavesdrop on a thirtysomething African-American man as he's counseled by a much older African-American man who knew Dr. Martin Luther King; their conversation focuses on optimism, ethics and the importance of love; its conclusion, a solo statement about life by the elder man, is one of the highlights of this moviegoing year.  As anybody who's familiar with public transit will attest, there's something about taking a long ride by yourself that encourages you to volunteer information you might not discuss with your own family. Passengers talk to the filmmakers and to each other about their relationship and marital troubles, their doubts about their career, their fear of aging, illness and death, and the difficulty of making a living in a supposed land of plenty. As the characters talk, mill about, eat, sleep, play cards and talk on the phone, the film crew's cameras frame them within an array of geometric spaces created by the rectangular shapes of windows and door frames, and track their progress from car to car, the overhead lighting panels and regimented rows of seats stretching into the distance in exaggerated perspective that makes the train seem a thousand miles long. The sound design is exceptional as well. There is no score to speak of, only snippets of pop songs that we hear briefly on passengers' phones, plus a bit of an old standard played (with merciful brevity) on a ukulele. After a while, the noises of the train itself become the binding element of the experience of watching \"In Transit\": the bell going ding-ding as the train goes into a station, the horn blowing as the train glides around corners or passes through towns.  No surprise that such an old-school project was masterminded by the late Albert Maysles (1926-2015). With his brother David (1931-1987), Maysles helped create \"Direct Cinema,\" an observational type of filmmaking that believed that the filmmaker should be as unobtrusive as possible, both in the room with subjects and later on when the footage is being edited. Maysles talked about \"In Transit\" for nearly two decades before this movie finally, posthumously appeared. It was originally envisioned as his pet project made of footage collected while riding trains: he would just take out his camera, interview people who were in the compartment with him, and then either keep going after they got off the train or disembark with them and see where they were going. I'm not sure how much footage he collected, but I'm told by people who worked with him that there was a lot. When I interviewed him for the Star-Ledger in 2000, he talked about and described some footage he'd already shot and made \"In Transit\" sound like the movie he'd been building up to throughout his long career. Advertisement This film is something else, though \u2014a collaboration between Maysles and co-directors Nelson Walker and Lynn True (who edited, brilliantly). None of the stuff Maysles shot over the years is in this movie: it's a one-shot project that attempts to realize his plan within a contained space and time span. The footage was shot by a team of camerapersons roaming about the train, plus a fixed camera that captured the landscapes rushing by outside. There is no indication of who shot what, though aficionados of Maysles' gently probing camerawork might have their suspicions.  All this makes \"In Transit\" a fascinating study in legacy as well as the gestalt of trains and the personalities of people who ride them. The characteristic Maysles mix of curiosity and compassion is present in every moment  of \"In Transit.\" It doesn't always feel like the films that Maysles made with and without his brother, but there are times when it does, strongly so, and there are other times when the Maysles touch is apparent even when the film is making choices that Maysles might not have made. And that's how Maysles would have wanted it, I suspect. In the second half of his life, he was as much a mentor as he was a filmmaker. Among its many virtues, \"In Transit\" is a moving tribute by students to a master who taught them how to see while encouraging their vision."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "NOW: In the Wings on a World Stage", "Review": "Being interviewed about his process of creating the hunchbacked Richard III for the 2012 Bridge Project production he took around the world, Kevin Spacey talked a lot about the physicality of the character, the psychology, and then said that, ultimately, \"I just let the play take me.\" Unfortunately, \"NOW: In the Wings on a World Stage,\" the Jeremy Whelehan-directed documentary about the \"Richard III\" production, doesn't do the same thing. The play is not allowed to take us anywhere; the documentary is more interested in the experience of the actors and what it was like for them to work with Kevin Spacey and tour the world. \"Istanbul is so exotic,\" is one reaction from a young actor, and that's about as good as the commentary gets. Advertisement The disjointed, flighty structure, including backstage \"confessionals,\" makes the documentary feel like an extended episode of MTV's \"Road Rules,\" with only occasionally tantalizing glimpses of the actual production. Scenes are not allowed to play out in full, and there is often voiceover placed over the scenes, where actors reminisce about what it was like working on the scene in question. The end result is confusing and frustrating. Al Pacino's \"Looking For Richard\" grappled with the great challenge of the play itself, and that monster of a lead role. \"NOW: In the Wings of a World Stage\" feels self-congratulatory in comparison, a cast sharing its fun photo album of a year-long vacation in \"exotic\" locations. The Bridge Project was the brainchild of Kevin Spacey and Sam Mendes, a partnership between BAM, the Old Vic, and Mendes' production company Neal Street, devoted to bringing productions of classic plays to audiences around the world, using a cast of both American and English actors. Due to union rules, this sort of cross-national-pollination in casting is rare, and Mendes said, \"The idea behind The Bridge Project was born out of a simple desire: a wish for artists, collaborators, and audiences on both sides of the Atlantic to experience one another's work, talent, and artistry in the theater.\" The Bridge Project started off with two 2009 productions, Shakespeare's \"Winter's Tale\" and Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\". Two more productions followed, and in 2012, the Bridge Project's final production was \"Richard III,\" starring Kevin Spacey in the lead role. They toured the world with \"Richard III,\" taking it to Turkey, Italy, China, Greece, etc. \"NOW\" introduces us to the cast. There are American actors, some of whom have never done Shakespeare before. There are British actors, some damn-near legendary, like Gemma Jones. The American actors discuss being intimidated by the British actors and their facility with language, and part of the Bridge Project's mission was to try to blend the two traditions. We are shown some of the rehearsal process, although not enough of it. Instead, we are subjected to long scenes watching the cast surf down sand dunes in Dubai and talk about what a great experience it was for them as a group. It feels like sitting at a table with a bunch of people who were all just on vacation together and want to show you 500 photos of the amazing time they just had. Advertisement There is one long section in the documentary where Annabel Scholey, who played Anne, discusses the challenge of Act 1, Scene 2, where the scheming Richard seduces Anne over the coffin bearing the body of King Henry VI. At the beginning of the scene, Anne rails at Richard, calling him a \"foul devil,\" and by the end of it, she is engaged to be married to him. She leaves the stage, and Richard smirks, \"Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?/Was ever woman in this humour won?\" The journey one must take during that scene is a daunting challenge for any actress. Scholey talks in-depth about her approach and how she and Spacey cracked it in rehearsal. But again, frustratingly, we are never allowed to see the end result play out in full. We get only glimpses. The documentary seems to think we are more interested in seeing the cast take pictures of each other on the Great Wall of China and talking about how much they miss their families back home than doing the actual show. Richard III is one of the largest lead roles Shakespeare ever wrote. The character is rarely off-stage. There is the physical challenge of creating the man's disabilities. Actors have ruined their backs, sometimes permanently, while doing a long run of \"Richard III.\" Antony Sher, in his wonderful book \"Year of the King,\" which details his process creating the role for the 1984 Royal Shakespeare Company production, talked about how he worked with a physical therapist in preparation for the run. Spacey's comments on the character of Richard III are somewhat interesting, especially the bit about how once Richard puts the crown on his head, everything changes. Up until then, he has been a delightful villain, commiserating with the audience, cackling in glee (Richard is quite funny). Once he actually gets what he wants\u2014the crown\u2014the only thing left to do is protect his power at all costs. There is a great moment in the play which everyone referred to as \"The Qaddafi Entrance,\" where Spacey, wearing dark sunglasses, a rakish crown, and a military uniform emblazoned with medals and wide epaulets, staggers onstage surrounded by an entourage of bodyguards, with martial drum-rolls accompanying the entrance. It looked thrilling. It would have been nice to see more of it."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Patriots Day", "Review": "\"Patriots\u00a0Day,\" the third collaboration between star Mark Wahlberg and director Peter Berg, and the second in 2016 alone (the first being \"Deepwater Horizon\"), is about the terrorist bombing at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, which killed three people and wounded hundreds, and details the unprecedented citywide manhunt that took place over the following week, a week when all of Boston was shut down.\u00a0 It starts with a scene showing fictional cop Sgt. Tommy Saunders (Wahlberg) doing a routine drug bust. The point of the scene is to show that Saunders had been suspended earlier in the year, and is now given humiliating assignments like working the finish line of the Boston Marathon (occurring the following day). Saunders bristles at the thought of doing crowd control instead of what he sees as real police work. Of course, only a couple of hours later, Saunders is in the center of the bombing, where he rises to the occasion. This doesn't feel right, and his personal redemption story doesn't feel right either. The real-life investigators and real-life Boston cops who did the actual work provide so many examples of heroism and courage that the stories could fill a library. Berg and Wahlberg avoided this trap in the much more effective \"Deepwater Horizon,\" which focused solely on the event itself and the terrible impact it had on the people who worked on that rig. Thankfully, Saunders\u2014while ostensibly the main character\u2014plays his role in the midst of a huge ensemble: citizens, FBI agents, government officials, Boston cops, cops in nearby Watertown where terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was eventually discovered hiding in a boat in someone's backyard. And it is this story, the real story, that saves \"Patriots\u00a0Day.\" Advertisement Berg, who wrote the script with Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer, zips around in the narrative, starting with the opening sequence showing the morning of the marathon, as experienced by characters who will play major roles in the days to come: young couple Jessica Kensky (Rachel Brosnahan) and Patrick Downes (Christopher O'Shea), Northeastern student Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang), fresh-faced MIT policeman Sean Collier (Jack Picking), Watertown police Sergeant Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons), and Saunders, bitching to his wife (Michelle Monaghan) about having to put on a day-glo vest. We also see Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (Alex Wolff) and his brother Tamerlan (Themo Melikidze) hanging out at their dark, depressing apartment, making their final preparations, all as Tamerlan's wife (Melissa Benoist) bitches that her husband didn't buy the right kind of milk. Combined with the thrumming score from Trent Reznor, and stunning aerial shots of Boston at sunrise, this opening sequence creates the anticipatory dread of the events to come. As with \"Deepwater Horizon\" (where the special effects had such grit that you could practically feel the heat of the fire), the bombing, when it happens, is sudden and visceral.\u00a0 \"Patriots\u00a0Day\" kicks into real gear once the investigation starts. Big-wigs descend: FBI special agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon), Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), Boston Mayor Thomas Menino (Vincent Curatola), Governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach), fight over the best way to proceed, all as FBI agents hole up with CCTV footage and cell-phone videos, looking for possible suspects. Berg is on sure ground here, and it shows. The story is simplified into its urgent essence: Who did this? Where are they? Are there more bombs? Competent people focused on working a problem are fascinating to watch.\u00a0 On a separate track is the bumbling incompetent getaway of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan. Their plans to get to New York and set off more bombs derails almost immediately. The carjacking and abduction of Dun Meng, aimlessly driving around the outer environs of Boston trying to figure out what to do next, lead up to Meng's thrilling (and insanely brave) escape and it's clearly the story element that Berg finds most cinematic and interesting. Berg spends the most time here. There's an unevenness to the pacing because of it, but it's in this long sequence (the longest in the film) that the Tsarnaev dynamic is most clearly evident: Tamerlan is the panicking ferocious big brother and Dzhokar is the oblivious punk kid brother, wondering out loud if there's an iPod port in the SUV and whining about Tamerlan not letting him drive. The thought process leading up to their actions is unexplored. Dzhokar, in particular, seems incapable of deep thought in any way whatsoever. There are incongruous moments of humor, as poor Meng tries to bargain with his captors, pleading for his life, until he finally realizes they are not going to let him go and whatever happens, no one is coming to save him and he must save himself. Advertisement Was Tamerlan's mysterious wife involved? What did she know? There's an interrogation scene that yields no clues (and to this day, Katherine Russell\u00a0has not been charged with anything). Did Dzokhar realize the kind of trouble he could get into? Alex Wolff plays the role on its surface, and it's a frightening and effective choice. He pouts and makes jokes, showing that he does not quite grasp the enormity of what he has done. Meanwhile, under intense pressure, the multi-tentacled investigation masses up around them until there is no way out. These events are familiar: we all watched them happen on the news (I was at Ebertfest at the time: my whole family is from Boston, and one of my mother's closest friends lives in the neighborhood where Dzokhar was finally found, and was texting my mother updates on the chaos unfolding outside), but Berg and company have recreated them in a gripping and immediate narrative. The hero worship of a fictional character in the midst of all of this real-life drama is a mistake. A down-on-his-luck cop finds himself\u00a0essential to a huge\u00a0federal investigation, stumbling into\u00a0the\u00a0center of every major moment in the search and capture that followed, even to the point where\u00a0beloved designated hitter for the Boston Red Sox, David Ortiz, reaches out to shake his hand\u2014personally\u2014just prior to walking out onto the field at Fenway Park and making a now-famous and cathartic speech\u00a0to the crowd. It's too much. The hero of \"Patriots\u00a0Day\" is the community of Boston, not a fictional guy played by a movie star (albeit a famous Bostonian).\u00a0 Fred (\"Mr.\") Rogers once said, \u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.'\" The quote is thrown around a lot in times of catastrophe but that does not lessen its truth. If you've been through a terrorist attack, or a natural disaster, or any violent event, then you know that Mr. Rogers is right. Disaster strikes, and there are those who rush to the scene to help in any way they can. It's inspirational in the purest sense of the word. \"Patriots\u00a0Day\" is at its best when it focuses on the real-life people\u2014first responders, overwhelmed emergency room doctors, local policemen and FBI agents, those manning the phones for citizen tips, the hacker-types analyzing mounds of video footage\u2014who ran to the middle of the maelstrom and got busy helping, the living embodiment of \"Boston Strong.\" Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Green Inferno", "Review": "Controversial filmmaker Eli Roth (\"Hostel,\" \"Cabin Fever\") has finally made a film with squirm-inducing skills that match its provocative payload. Roth's homage to notorious Italian films like \"Cannibal Holocaust\" is a nasty piece of work with a mean spirit that is tempered by believable sympathy with naive protagonist Justine (Lorenza Izzo), a college freshman who travels to Peru with a student activist group after she becomes traumatized by a college lecture on female genital mutilation. Because Roth is an existential misanthrope, Justine faces the worst nightmare of any privileged white protagonist with unexamined racism in their hearts: an inhuman tribe of flesh-eating cannibals who behead, gouge, impale, drug and devour any outsiders unfortunate enough to cross their paths. \"The Green Inferno\" is, in that sense, not so much a knock against Occupy Wall-Street-style slacktivists (though it is also that) so much as it's an accomplished, mean-spirited horror film about a heroine who is too young to understand the motives for her do-gooder idealism. Advertisement From the start, Justine is asked\u2014by her even-tempered diplomat father Charles (Richard Burgi) and bitchy romantic rival Kara (Ignacia Allamand)\u2014why she's joining a mission to stop the destruction of an indigenous Peruvian tribe's ancestral home. Justine has immediately superficial reasons: she's attracted to student leader Alejandro (Ariel Levy), a dickishly self-serious leader who initially asks Justine to leave his group when she mockingly raises doubts about his methods' efficacy. Still, Justine makes her way back into Alejandro's good graces in a scene that complicates her horny-for-teacher motives: Justine challenges Alejandro, and says that maybe his group might have a greater impact if he were more inclusive.\u00a0 That call to inclusivity is ironic given that this is an Eli Roth film. Roth mocks Justine's peers before circumstantial peril humanizes them (mostly; more on this in a moment). These kids want to smoke weed, they lead with their alternative lifestyle (Veganism is wacky!), and are deeply hormonal. They are, in other words, the perfect examples of the American exceptionalism that Roth mocked in \"Hostel,\" only this time they're too young, dumb and full of bad ideas to be treated like real bad guys. Still, there is an element of you-get-what-you-give moralism to the blood-soaked massacre that ensues after Alejandro's group's plane experiences engine failure and crash-lands in the midst of a people-eating Peruvian tribe. The violence in these scenes is intense. It's technically not gratuitous however because the extreme nature of Roth's film is its primary reason to exist. Still, with that in mind, it's interesting to see how Roth's fanboyish impulse to top \"Cannibal Holocaust\" director Ruggero Deodato and his Italian contemporaries winds up inadvertently revealing the relatively humanizing aspects of \"The Green Inferno\" as a cultural critique. If you buy into Roth's film, these cannibals are the worst nightmare of girls like Justine, a character who stubbornly has to convince herself that she knows what she's doing when she follows her impulse to translate her revulsion with genital mutilation into progressive political action.\u00a0 Advertisement But as with the protagonists of any halfway decent post-\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" horror film, the humanity of Justine's peers kick in along with their survival instinct. They cannot reason with a seemingly uncivilized third world group whose physical appearance\u2014bones through their noses, red dye covering their skin, and loin cloths over their extremities\u2014immediately broadcasts their alien nature. So it stands to reason that violence is extreme, and copious throughout \"The Green Inferno.\" Roth defines his characters based on what he knows they're not: smart or introspective enough to be wise beyond their years, and certainly not emotionally hardy enough to know how their bodies react under extreme stress. So, because selfishness and\u00a0naivet\u00e9\u00a0are universal constants in Roth's cynical world, the natives of \"The Green Inferno\" must be lopsidedly sadistic. \"The Green Inferno\" is accordingly at its best when it's a horror film that thinks it's a satire, and not a satire that acts like a horror film. There are a couple of notable missteps, particularly in the scene where blonde vegan Amy (Kirby Bliss Blanton) has diarrhea. The scene is presented as an unnerving, even surreal moment in an already unbelievable, intolerable situation. But the sound effects guy was clearly instructed to go to town, and he winds up giving short shrift to one of the film's most believably pathetic characters. Thankfully, while one might wonder what value a horror film that uses savage tribesmen stereotypes, Roth's film does represent anti-heroic Justine and her peers through a lens that is both critical and human enough. \"The Green Inferno\" is not exactly a feel-good film, but it gets a very particular job done."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Door", "Review": "When Emerenc, the central character of Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3's \"The Door,\" sweeps the pavement to rid it of snow, she looks like she's fighting an enemy. Every sweep is fierce and deliberate and there's a determination to the old woman's movements that testifies to far greater battles she's fought in the past. By the time she's done, the snow has covered the pavement again \u2014 which for Emerenc doesn't mean defeat. It just means more sweeping. Emerenc is played by Helen Mirren, who lends the character all the regal force contained in her Oscar-winning turn in \"The Queen\" (2006), even as she repackages it as working-class resilience. The film, which takes place in 1960s Hungary, opens with Mirren's character landing a job as a maid for a well-off married couple of Magda (Martina Gedeck) and Tibor (K\u00e1roly Eperjes). Magda is an aspiring writer, hungry for inspiration and impressionable enough to quickly fall under the spell of her no-nonsense new servant. Even though we never get to hear excerpts from Magda's novel, it is made clear that it feeds off Emerenc's story and personality.  Advertisement Mirren's Emerenc is the ultimate tough cookie; she's not afraid to talk back to her employers and, in a subtle way, she ends up making them fawn over her. Had there been any malice to the character, she could have easily pulled off the sinister scenario played out by Dirk Bogarde in \"The Servant.\" As it is, \"The Door\" is about something less abstract than mind games and power struggles \u2014 it's a careful character study. Emerenc's sense of order and duty are unshakable, but her past is scarred by war and death. She's a creature of contrasts, at once giving and withholding, cold and selfless, uneducated and wise. Despite her brusque demeanor, all living things are drawn to her. Dogs, kittens and children all seek refuge at her side, which actually turns out to be the basis for a crucial, if not-to-be-revealed, plot point. Magda's fascination with the woman leads her to inquire about long-buried secrets, best embodied by Emerenc's home -- forever shut to visitors and sharing its owner's burdens of the past. \"The Door\" is, ultimately, about two childless women with various capacity for care-giving: while Magda wallows in enough self-dramatization to join the cast of \"Girls,\" Emerenc can be brutally self-effacing and doesn't make a fuss over her own heroic choices. The film takes place in communist-era Budapest, but was shot in English, which diminishes its plausibility a bit \u2014 and further alienates the character of Magda's avuncular hubby Tibor, dubbed so badly that his voice seems to be coming from a distant room even in tight close-ups. (Incidentally, the nature of the couple's sex life isn't even hinted at, which feels like a cop-out in a film about a writer's self-discovery.) Brightly lit and crisp throughout, the movie's look suggests the fresh linen that Emerenc so frequently handles. Visually, there's an elegance to \"The Door\" that feels both a virtue and a limitation. Szab\u00f3 was never famous for visual flair, but he can still be a superb director of actors. Klaus Maria Brandauer gave the performance of a lifetime in his Oscar-winning \"Mephisto\" (1982), and Annette Bening received her third Oscar nomination for playing a larger-than-life thespian in Szab\u00f3's \"Being Julia.\"  Advertisement As expected, Helen Mirren is very good in \"The Door\": stripped of glamour and clad in raggedy clothes in practically every scene, she's nevertheless so radiant that it's no surprise her screen partner Gedeck (of \"The Lives of Others\") ends up being overshadowed. Still, there's a feeling that Szab\u00f3 works against Mirren at times. Her big monologue about childhood trauma ends up reduced to a mere voice-over, while the director cuts to an awful flashback sequence that suggests a straight-to-DVD remake of Tim Burton's \"Sleepy Hollow.\" What the movie never discusses is the source of Magda and Tibor's privilege. Much is made of the jarring class differences between Emerenc and the married couple. The disparities range from dwelling conditions (old hut vs. spacious mansion) to matters of taste (rich decoration vs. china trinkets). The movie goes so far as as to have  Emerenc give a curt lecture on applied Marxism (\"The are two kinds of people in this world: those who sweep and those who get others to sweep\"), and yet never answers the question of how on earth did Tibor and Magda achieve such high standard of living amidst the communist drabness of 1960s Hungary. The fact is that the only way for them to live it up (as we see them do), would be to ensconce themselves in upper echelons of the Communist Party, which would have to entail some level of compromise and/or entanglement in its totalitarian reign. The only scene that even hints at the subject comes when Magda receives a call from the minister of culture congratulating her on her novel, and Tibor reacts with fear, for he senses there might be some double meaning behind the praise. There's never any payoff to that brief scene, which is especially disappointing in a film by Szab\u00f3, whose \"Mephisto\" was a supreme examnation of what it takes to make it big as an artist under totalitarian rule.  Magda writes a bestseller in communist Hungary, and there's not even a mention of the fact that any book published under the regime had to go through the hands of a state censor. Doesn't Magda care \u2014 an improbable trait in a writer \u2014 or is it Szab\u00f3\u2026? I bet Emerenc wouldn't have let him off the hook the way he apparently expects us to. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Merchants of Doubt", "Review": "What do the deniers of climate change and apologists for big tobacco \r\nhave in common? Spokespeople sent into the media to sow doubt.  Director Robert Kenner (\"Food, Inc.\") and his cowriter Kim Roberts lay it all out for us in \"Merchants of Doubt,\" a compendium of public deceptions based on the same-titled book by science historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway. The story begins in the 1950s with the tobacco industry's strategy for staving off government regulation, then moves on through the decades. The film shows how public relations strategies devised to make the public doubt that cigarettes caused cancer were refined into a template that would be used by industries selling all sorts of materials and products, including food and food additives, pharmaceuticals, oil, coal, asbestos, and flame retardant chemicals used on furniture coverings. The latter is the focus of the movie's strongest section, which shows how the tobacco industry's obscuring tactics were applied to another industry's PR problems.  Advertisement In the 1950s, when scientists first linked cigarettes to cancer, the public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton created what turned out to be a winning strategy: augmenting the direct lies of tobacco industry executives and spokespeople with \"third party\" testimonies by people who seemed to have no dog in the hunt but were really wearing an invisible corporate leash. Scientists and pseudo-scientists hired by big tobacco were ushered into the public eye to sow doubt about the science, and plead for more studies, or more time to study the data before concluding that cigarettes were harmful. (There's a montage of tobacco industry shills repeating variations on \"Cigarettes may not be hazardous.\")  The movie compares this to three-card Monte dealers paying a \"stranger\" to stand near them, watch them with delight, then participate and \"win\" the game, so that bystanders would think it wasn't rigged, join in, and lose their money. The cigarette doubt-sowers succeeded with this approach a generation. Warning labels didn't appear on cigarette packages until 1966, and advertising was regulated slowly over the next few decades. The movie shows how the same strategy was applied by companies that made the chemicals used to treat furniture.  Until the 1970s, a large number of people died from fires caused by smokers falling asleep without extinguishing their cigarettes. Because it would have cost money to treat cigarettes with flame-extinguishing chemicals, the tobacco industry planted a \"legislative representative\" from their own ranks within the National Association of Fire Marshals, which then argued that the real problem was furniture catching fire. This led to furniture being treated with \"flame retardant\" chemicals (sometimes as much as two pounds' worth in an average sofa) that did not actually retard flame, and that were subsequently linked to ailments and conditions, including low fertility and cancer. Chemical manufacturers sowed doubt about health problems caused by their products through a front group, Citizens for Fire Safety, which was shuttered in 2012 after a Chicago Tribune investigation discovered that they were funded by Albermarle Corporation, \r\nICL Industrial Products and Chemtura, the three largest makers of flame \r\nretardant chemicals.  Advertisement The movie is filled with similar examples of corporate treachery, leading up to the present day, which finds oil and gas companies sowing doubt about climate change through front groups, hired gun scientists and other shills. Oreskes, co-author of the film's source book, appears on camera to tell how she fact-checked the widely repeated assertion that there was no consensus on climate change, and discovered that of 989 scientists who'd seriously studied the topic, not one thought there was serious doubt that human industry and pollution contributed to a rise in average global temperatures.\u00a0  This is a huge, unwieldy topic. The filmmakers do an admirable job of condensing their information and making it comprehensible. They don't really succeed in unifying it, though, or in making the whole enterprise seem like more than a collection of talking points for people who are mad about climate change deniers, people paid to sow doubt about the damage caused by smoking, and their ilk.  But that doesn't seem to be the point of the movie. The film is mainly useful as one-stop shopping for the opposition. Scored with mischievous caper music, it keeps \r\nrevisiting an ominous (and purely metaphorical) archive filled with \r\ndamning documents (picture the warehouses at the ends of \"Citizen Kane\" \r\nor \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"). It uses computer graphics and digital \r\ncompositing to show incriminating papers gliding out of folders and \r\nfloating through the air as if manipulated by accusing spirits, and \r\nsuperimposes the filing cabinets with news footage of industry bigwigs \r\nand hired \"experts\" going on talk shows and appearing before government \r\ncommittees to deliver an approved script. \"Merchants of Doubt\" opens with scenes of illusionist Jaimy Ian Swiss \r\nperforming card tricks for an audience at The Magic Castle in Los Angeles. He tells the viewer that while he's a proud expert at fooling audiences, he makes an \"honest living\" because the people \r\nwho watch him expect to be tricked and know it's all entertainment\u2014and \r\nthat the same is not true of shills for \r\ncorporations aiming to deceive the public, thwart government regulators, and protect shareholders. \"It offends me\r\n when someone takes the skills of my honest living, if you will, and \r\nuses it to twist and distort and manipulate people and their sense of \r\nreality,\" he says.\u00a0The movie returns again and again to images of illusionists, card sharps and street hustlers, to show how industries' self-protective strategies are variations on con games.\u00a0The only real challenge, explains magician Swiss, is \"how to mask the shill.\" Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Act of Valor", "Review": "\"Act of Valor\" contains hard-hitting combat footage, relentless and effective. There is a story behind the film that is no less engrossing. In an introduction, its co-directors, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, speak directly to the audience, describing how they got involved in a film about the Navy SEALs, how they were embedded with an actual SEAL unit \u2014 and how, when that project grew into a fiction film, they determined to use real SEALs and not professional actors. The early version of the film, according to reporting by Rebecca Keegan of the Los Angeles Times, was variously intended as a training or recruitment film, and was made outside the usual Department of Defense guidelines for motion pictures. It now emerges as a thriller involving two (non-factual) scenarios, one about a SEALs mission to free a kidnapped CIA operative (Roselyn Sanchez), the other about a plot to smuggle terrorists into the United States through tunnels from Mexico constructed by drug cartels.  Advertisement The details in both of these scenarios seem realistic \u2014 although how would I know? The co-directors and their team have produced an accomplished, riveting action movie. I am reminded of the initial impact of films like Oliver Stone's \"Platoon\" and Kathryn Bigelow's \"The Hurt Locker,\" which both told convincing and authentic stories. \"Act of Valor,\" however, centers more on action and much less on the human elements involved. The central characters are played by actual Navy SEALs, who were apparently on active duty during the filming and still are. This makes it difficult to write the ordinary kind of review, because none of their real names are revealed and indeed some of the characters seem to have no names at all. I learn from Rebecca Keegan's article that the characters named Chief Dave and Lt. Rorke are played by SEALs whose real first names are Dave and Rorke. Thanks a lot. The official cast listing is a baffling mixture of characters without names and names with \"uncredited\" roles, and doesn't include either Chief Dave and Lt. Rorke, so I am reduced to describing the experience and not the performances. Much of the movie consists of pure action, punctuated by terse dialogue and few subtleties. We don't get to know the characters as individuals, they don't have personality traits, they have no back stories, they don't speak in colorful dialogue, and after the movie you'd find yourself describing events but not people. Assuming that the characters described as SEALs were being played by real SEALs, all I can say is that they were convincing and weren't asked to do any dramatic stretching they weren't capable of. Yet the movie can be discussed on another level. In the same week I saw \"Act of Valor,\" I also saw an extraordinary film named \"Hell and Back Again.\" It's one of this year's Oscar nominees for best documentary feature, and will open in many markets on the same day as \"Act of Valor.\" It is about a real man, Marine Sgt. Nathan Harris, and his real wife, Ashley. Harris led men in combat in Afghanistan. Shortly before the scheduled end of his six-month tour, a sniper's bullet entered his right buttock, shattered his hip socket and bounced back to destroy leg bones. He's quite willing to show people the entry scar and describe how he has two rods filling in for bones.  Advertisement When Nathan Harris was a teenager, he says, \"What I wanted to do was kill people.\" He enlisted in the Marines. He doesn't actually say if he has killed anyone or not, but the director, Danfung Dennis, who was embedded with Harris' Echo Company, followed him in action, and we see that he has grown into a natural leader of men. Some of the film's most involving scenes show him debating village elders (through an interpreter) about the role of America in Afghanistan; he sincerely believes he is helping to bring them freedom, and finds it hard to answer their statements that they want to be left alone by both the Americans and the Taliban. The film follows Harris home, through an agonizing period of rehab and shows that his life will never be the same. Memories of battle haunt him, and \"Hell and Back Again\" intercuts actual sights and scenes from Afghanistan with scenes back home in North Carolina. He doesn't have post-traumatic stress syndrome. He dreams of returning to action, and it is hard for him to accept that it may not happen. \"Act of Valor\" is gift-wrapped in patriotism. It was once intended as a recruitment film, and that's how it plays. The action scenes are harrowing but exciting. Lots of explosions and special effects. At the end, there is a full-dress military funeral, honoring three generations of warriors. The real action scenes in \"Hell and Back Again\" don't play like an action movie. I don't recall seeing a single Taliban fighter. One of Sgt. Harris' men is killed on the first day in the field. Harris is wounded late in his tour. Nobody saw either one of the snipers.  I have a feeling that the teenage Nathan Harris, who wanted to kill people, would have loved \"Act of Valor.\" But \"Hell and Back Again,\" in describing his life today, doesn't play like a recruitment film. A great deal is made by the directors McCoy and Waugh that actual live ammunition was used in the making of their film. Actual live ammunition was also used in \"Hell and Back Again.\" If you asked Sgt. Nathan Harris what he thought about using live ammo in a Hollywood action movie, what do you suppose he would say? My best guess is, he would say they were damned fools. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "A Hijacking", "Review": "Negotiation is a transaction that results in compromise: what we're willing to live with to get on with business. The value is measured not in worth but rather in cost. So when lives are at stake, how do negotiators arrive at a tolerable number? \"A Hijacking\" starts by introducing us to the 7-man crew of a Danish cargo ship, on their way home from the middle of the Indian Ocean. It then takes us to Denmark, where the CEO of the fleet, Peter (S\u00f8ren Malling), proficiently talks Japanese businessmen down to just under $15 million on an unnamed deal. Shortly after, Peter discovers that Somali pirates have hijacked the ship we saw only moments ago. When they ask for $15 million in exchange for the lives of the crew, Connor, the hostage negotiator, advises to offer them a paltry $500,000. Advertisement The lowballing is meant to convey that the corporation won't bend for bandits, but if it were up to the crewmembers, Peter would give the pirates whatever they want. Of course, if he did, they'd just ask for more. The situation is impossible, which is why the hostages endure captivity for over four months. This film is about the glacial pace of these types of negotiations. There's no hero in \"A Hijacking.\" Nobody throws punches or tries to wrestle a weapon out of a pirate's hands. Everyone is just forced to wait. If anything, the film exposes the deep moral callousness of those doing the dealing, and the desperation of the people they break. Because Director Tobias Lindholm is interested in all the tensions of this interaction, the experience is consistently engrossing, if unsettling. The crew lives in constant fear of their gun-toting captors, even when they somewhat befriend them. Their quarters are awkward and cramped, not meant to be shared with some 25 errant pirates. On the other side, Peter is anxious to wrap things up, but he also can't be bullied into bankruptcy. The hostage negotiator warns him that he should outsource the bargaining to an unbiased expert, but Peter refuses. \"This is my company, it's my ship, these are my men,\" he declares. A tragic flaw, since the pirates have the foresight to hire their own translator-negotiator, Omar (Abdihakin Asgar), to do the talking. Even Omar wants to remove himself from the situation. \"I'm not one of them,\" he keeps insisting to the crew and to Peter. He sees himself as a hired hand with a linguistic advantage \u2014 not a criminal \u2014 and gets swiftly angry if anyone suggests otherwise.  The bulk of the stress revolves around 12 phone calls between Peter and Omar. Connor is always present to make sure each conversation never gets frantic. The one time things reach Samuel L. Jackson pitch, there are immediate consequences. The film earns Dogme points with handheld cinematography and uncomfortable, sometimes inefficient lighting. But Lindholm wanted to achieve maximum realism. So the boat scenes were filmed on a real ship in the Indian Ocean. A satellite phone was set up on the boat to make phone calls to the actors in Denmark, so echoes and lagging weren't scripted and the reactions were often improvised. Advertisement Gary Skjoldmose-Porter, who plays Connor, is an actual hostage negotiator. He convinced Lindholm not to create a plasma screen-filled situation room and instead opt for a small conference set-up and sticking red tape on the phone the CEO would use. Other non-actors include 4 of the crewmembers of the MV Rozen, which was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2007.  \"Violence is expensive,\" is the simple \u2014 and loaded \u2014 thing that director Alrick Brown said during Ebertfest 2011, when someone asked him why there was a lack of bloodshed in \"Kinyarwanda,\" a movie about the 1994 Rwandan genocide. That's why all the violence in \"A Hijacking\" occurs off-screen. To create terror in the minds of the viewers, indie film directors must acknowledge the horror without filming it, and demand strong performances from the actors. This is especially applicable to the character of Mikkel (Pilou Asb\u00e6k), the ship's cook. \"A Hijacking\" follows him as he progresses from anxious to angry, resigned, and finally, shell-shocked. When he witnesses a violent act, the dread doesn't register. What his obvious despondence says is, \"this wasn't worth it.\" That's so much more terrible than seeing what he saw. \"A Hijacking\" is a fascinating examination of failed diplomacy and everything that's wrong with a system that places so little value on human life. That we care what happens to the crew is what's right with us, even if it's inadequate. Those concerned about subtitles can rest assured that enough of the dialogue is spoken in English, confirming that it's still the international language of business, even the dirty kind."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Barbara", "Review": "The woman sits in a park, legs crossed, smoking, relaxed. Two men watch her from a window above the park, and they discuss her, looking down on her. \"If she were six, you would say she was sulky,\" one of the men says. \"Since her incarceration, her group of friends has been destroyed.\" She is meeting the two men, and one says, \"She won't come in a moment before it's time.\" It is an eloquent exchange, and even more eloquently filmed, the woman seen in long shot, from above. She knows she is being watched. Her \"relaxation,\" then, is an act of public theatre.  Advertisement This is the opening scene in Christian Petzold's effective psychological and political thriller \"Barbara,\" and it sets up the tension and atmosphere with precision and a taut elegance. It is East Germany, 1980. Barbara, the woman, played by Petzold's regular muse, Nina Hoss, is a chilly alert blonde. Barbara is a doctor and has been placed in a rural medical clinic as punishment for applying for an exit visa. Given an apartment by the State, Barbara is under constant surveillance by the Stasi. Andre, the doctor who runs the clinic (played by the gentle, hunky Ronald Zehrfeld), is an informer for the Stasi, and yet he does not seem devoted or fanatical in that role. His primary priority is his patients. He would also like to get to The Hague someday, to see Rembrandt's \"Anatomy Lesson\" in person, although his hope for being allowed such a trip is dim. Andre recognizes Barbara's gift at her job during her first shift, when she correctly diagnoses a teenage girl (Jasna Fritzi Bauer) with meningitis, the signs of which the rest of the doctors had missed. Barbara, the cool character self-consciously smoking in the park, is an entirely different person at her job. The girl has escaped from Torgau, a Socialist work camp nearby, and Barbara treats her with a mischievous warm camaraderie, and reads to her at night. Barbara's choice of book is significant: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  In Mark Twain's classic, Huck and Jim, on the run, take to the Mississippi River in a raft, loosening the fetters that bind them on the mainland, all while plunging deeper and deeper into slave country. Barbara, who has secret rendezvous in a nearby forest with a lover from West Germany, smokes expensive black market cigarettes, and has mysterious meetings with people who surreptitiously hand her packets of money, is a flight risk: you can sense that in her tense posture, and in her wild-looking eyes flicking out the window at the sound of every car horn.  Advertisement Nina Hoss is a magnificent actress, watchful, tense, and spikily intelligent. When a smile cracks open on her face, the warmth and beauty is heartbreaking, because of the contrast. Hoss' work in all of Petzold's films is good, and while he has used her continuously, she never shows up as quite the same character. The woman in \"Yella\" is not the same as the one in \"Jerichow\" or in \"Barbara.\" Nina Hoss can do anything.  In East Germany, in 1980, no one is to be trusted, and Petzold creates that sense of oppression with meticulous sound design (never has a doorbell sounded so frightening), and yawning gaps in between conversations, gaps filled with sound: wind, echoing footsteps in a hallway, trees rustling, the crunch of gravel under bicycle wheels. There is no score. The only music comes from the radio, once, and when Barbara plays her newly-tuned piano alone in her apartment. Barbara's landlady stares at her with cold expressionless eyes, a piano tuner shows up unexpectedly, freaking Barbara out (he must be there to inform on her), and every interpersonal interaction is charged with suspicion. Even the romantic and sexual tension in between Barbara and Andre seems loaded and dangerous.  \"Barbara\" is extremely suspenseful, without using the common genre trappings. The workings of the clinic are observed in a detailed fashion. Andre has set up a lab where he makes his own serum, a fact that impresses Barbara, accustomed as she is to better big-city hospitals. Petzold's films with Hoss are often about different sub-cultures of work, as well as about the long shadow left by Germany's split: in \"Yella,\" Petzold examines the risky thrill-seeking world of corporate negotiations; in \"Jerichow\" it's the ins and outs of snack bar ownership, and in \"Barbara,\" the challenges of running an out-of-the-way clinic, short on supplies and staff. There are decisions to be made about the patients (the teenage girl with meningitis, and another teenager, a failed suicide), and these decisions require cooperation and openness, anathema in a police state.  Andre, after examining the boy who attempted suicide, confides to Barbara, \"I don't know. Something is wrong. I can feel it.\" One could say that about the entirety of the world portrayed in \"Barbara,\" a world filled with everyday objects: bathtubs, pianos, bicycles, cigarettes, all of which take on portentous significance when seen in the context of totalitarian culture. Something is wrong in East Germany, and everyone can feel it. Doctors examine a patient and make a guess at a diagnosis.  The reality of Barbara's world, and the world of all East Germans, is one of constant surveillance, omnipresent informers, and a huge gap between private and public behavior. Petzold is a master at creating the kind of tension that can be felt on a subterranean level, a sort of acute uneasiness that can't be easily diagnosed, fixed, or even acknowledged by the characters. This is well-trod ground for Petzold, but never has it been so fully realized, so palpable, as in \"Barbara.\" Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Still Walking", "Review": "Most family dramas contain too much drama. In most families, the past and present don't meet and find resolution during a 24-hour period, no matter how many American films you've seen about Thanksgiving. Painful family issues are more likely to stay beneath the surface, known to everyone but not spoken of. \"Still Walking,\" a magnificent new film from Japan, is very wise about that, and very true. \tA dozen years ago, the prized possession of this family was Junpei, the eldest son, doted on by his parents and admired by his younger brother and sister. But Junpei drowned while saving a life, and every year the family gathers, as many Japanese families do, to visit his grave and memory. Advertisement \tThese occasions are hated by Ryota (Hiroshi Abe), the second son. His father (Yoshio Harada) almost blames him for not being the one who died. On the drive to his home town at the seaside, Ryota tells his new wife Yukari (Yui Natsukawa) they must not even stay the night. This will be her first meeting with the parents; she is a widow with a young son. \tThe father is a retired physician, slowed with age, still marching joylessly on his daily walk. He stays mostly closed off in his office and greets his son brusquely. The mother has her doubts about this marriage; it is better to marry a divorced woman than a widow, because at least the divorce chose to leave her husband. \tAlso together for this day are Ryota's older sister and her husband. It is only slowly that we pick up the suppressed currents of feeling in the family; on the surface, the mother stays cheerful, although the old doctor's bitterness is obvious: The wrong son drowned. \tThe day arrived at some sort of centerpiece when they welcome a luncheon guest, who is never named. This is the man Junpei died while saving. He is homely, fat, ill at ease, squirmy, apologetic, bursting from his white dress shirt. The doctor clearly doesn't regard him as having been worth saving. Ryota has spent a lifetime feeling shunned by his father and considered inferior to his brother. He has been wounded time and again, and so he is alert to the discomfort of the saved man. Why do they even invite him? He's obviously suffering during these annual visits. They invite him, he learns offhandedly, because he suffers. If anyone can be considered an heir of the great Yasujiro Ozu, it might be Hirokazu Kore-Eda, the writer and director of \"Still Walking.\" In \"Maborosi\" (1995), \"After Life\" (1998) and \"Nobody Knows\" (2004), his first three features released in North America, and now in this film, he has produced profoundly empathetic films about human feelings. He sees intensely and tenderly into his characters. Like Ozu, he pays meticulous attention to composition and camera placement. Acting as his own editor, he doesn't cut for immediately effect, but for the subtle gathering of power. His actors look as if they could be such people as they portray. Advertisement \tHe feels a strong connection with spouses separated by death or circumstances, and the children who are involved. \"Maborosi\" involves a widow with a young son, who goes to a new seaside town to marry a virtual stranger. \"After Life,\" a serious fantasy, is about newly dead people who spend a week in a heavenly waiting room to prepare a film of the one memory they want to carry through eternity. \"Nobody Knows\" is about the children of a quasi-prostitute who leaves them to fend for themselves in a city apartment. \tNone of these films elevate the temperature with melodrama. They draw us inward with concern. Kore-Eda is a tender humanist, and that fits well with his elegant visual style. In \"Still Walking,\" he shares something valuable with Ozu: What I call Ozu's \"pillow shots,\" named after the \"pillow words\" in Japanese poetry, which separate passages with just a word of two, seemingly unconnected, for a pause in the rhythm. These shots may show passing trains (a favorite of both directors), or a detail of architecture or landscape. It isn't their subject that matters, it's their composure."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Bridgend", "Review": "Shot in its title location and featuring non-actors from the area, Jeppe R\u00f8nde's \u201cBridgend\u201d is directly inspired by a true phenomenon. The film\u2019s poster will not tell you that, but a pre-end-credits card will. It reveals that from 2007 to 2012 there were 79 suicides by hanging in Bridgend, South Wales (mostly by teenagers), with no suicide notes left behind. More than most true story films, the placement of this revelation proves to be one of the movie's biggest declarations, making truth an afterthought. \u201cBridgend\u201d does have a life on its own beyond fact, but the narrative it offers in place of the headlines only further proves how phenomena like adolescence and death is better observed, not investigated.\u00a0 Advertisement Our surrogate into the world of these teenagers is Hannah Murray\u2019s Sara, a new girl to Bridgend without any friends. She slowly finds her way into the group, one which she initially approaches with hesitation, but sees that their ruffian nature is an inward camaraderie. The group of teens hang out in the woods, drink alcohol and jump naked into a grungy, makeshift pond. In their next activity, they wander to the site of a friend's suicide. After pouring some of their alcohol on a makeshift grave, they tilt their heads up and howl his name to the sky. This is revealed to be a ritual just as much as it is primal, no different from how they cause havoc within the mortified town\u2014screaming, cussing, smoking, breaking stuff, being generally unpredictable. Very little seems to matter to these young adults, except for their friends and their freedom; it's a perfect summation of what it is like to be a teenager, and why death might be taken as less grave if everyone else is doing it.\u00a0 The power of R\u00f8nde\u2019s macabre coming-of-age story weakens as a narrative of some degree begins to take precedence. Sara gets closer to the group, especially with a young man named Jamie (Josh O'Connor), all at the behest of her father Vicar (Adrian Rawlins), a police officer in Bridgend who often embodies the famous creed that parents just don\u2019t understand. The performances from these three characters are all strong in spite of scant construction\u2014some of Murray\u2019s crises even have whiffs of Anna Paquin\u2019s unforgettable traumatized adolescent in Kenneth Lonergan's \u201cMargaret\u201d\u2014but they are far lower on the list of this film\u2019s curiosities than actors usually are.\u00a0 The question of why these suicides happen is not one that \"Bridgend\" dares to answer, which is refreshing. It isn\u2019t even a spoiler to say that the movie doesn\u2019t explain itself\u2014it might even help you with a less distracted viewing than my own. But the film\u2019s overall arc makes it seem like a revelation is coming, or that there is a type of order to be unearthed. We get this impression from two key characters: our surrogate Sara, who goes from being an outsider to a key member of the group, having close interactions with some teens who randomly end up dead by the end of the film; her policeman father, who asks out loud why these things are happening, who literally investigates the case. These two bring the movie to a third act that turns \u201cBridgend\u201d into the juvenile delinquent drama it isn\u2019t strong enough to be, since the characters and location are not fortified, nor is there is a strong propulsion to the narrative.\u00a0 Advertisement As R\u00f8nde\u2019s film is torn between experiential and experimenting, it does have a solid foundation with its gripping visual storytelling. Its dialogue doesn\u2019t compare to the flourishes found in visual motifs, like shots of ceremoniously folded clothes on a bed, or a dog that appears throughout, in the background, like the Grim Reaper. Thorough desaturation blankets everyone and everything, giving the whole movie a bleak atmosphere where teenage rebellion seems to be the only sign of life. There are even a few breathtaking moments of poetic faming, in which one or two people are then joined by a number of others who descend into the frame, a recurring shot that captures the personal experience of a group just as much as the individual.\u00a0 By that revealing credits card, \u201cBridgend\u201d is itself lost, but by its own making. The ambitions are there in R\u00f8nde\u2019s film and are exciting to witness, as is the evocative imagery. But \u201cBridgend\u201d feels imbalanced. For this abnormal case, to nudge even a hint of logic about adolescence or death reduces the overall impact, especially as its abstract remarks prove more productive."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Waiting for Superman", "Review": "Toward the end of \"Waiting for Superman,\" there is a sequence that cuts between lottery drawings for five charter schools. Admission to the best of these schools dramatically improves chances of school graduation and college acceptance. The applicants are not chosen for being gifted. They come from poor, disadvantaged neighborhoods. But the schools have astonishing track records.  We have met five of these students, heard from them and their parents, and hope they'll win. The cameras hold on their faces as numbers are drawn or names are called. The odds against them are 20 to 1. Lucky students leap in joy. The other 19 of the 20 will return to their neighborhood schools, which more or less guarantees they will be part of a 50 percent dropout rate. The key thing to keep in mind is that underprivileged, inner-city kids at magnet schools such as Kipp L.A. Prep or the Harlem Success Academy will do better academically than well-off suburban kids with fancy high school campuses, athletic programs, swimming pools, closed-circuit TV and lush landscaping.  Advertisement \"Waiting for Superman,\" the new documentary by Davis Guggenheim, contends the American educational system is failing, which we have been told before. He dramatizes this failure in a painfully direct way, says what is wrong, says what is right. One of his charts gets a laugh from the audience: Of developed nations, American students rank last in math skills. When the students are asked to guess their standing, Americans put themselves first. Meanwhile, jobs in Silicon Valley go without qualified Americans to fill them, and tech companies must import skilled employees from India and other \"poor\" countries. Guggenheim focuses on an African-American educator named Geoffrey Canada, who deliberately chose the poorest area of Harlem to open his Harlem Success Academy. His formula: qualified teachers, highly motivated, better paid. Emphasis on college prep from day one. Tutoring for those behind in math or reading. There are also charter boarding schools, with no TV or no video games. One kid says he wants in, but \"my feelings are bittersweet.\"  One problem with most schools, Guggenheim says, is that after teachers gain tenure in two years, it is almost impossible to fire them. In Illinois, for example, one out of 57 doctors loses his medical license, but only one in 2,500 teachers is fired. Some teachers flatly inform their students they have no intention of teaching. Guggenheim blames the powerful American Federation of Teachers, which is the top donor to national Democratic campaigns and state Republican campaigns. Any move to discipline incompetent teachers is met with fierce resistance. A union teacher is a teacher for life. That teachers themselves accept this is depressing. The film demonstrates (1) that quality education is possible for even the most disadvantaged students; (2) the cost is low, considering that high school dropouts often turn to crime when they can't find good jobs. In 10 years, the film claims, there will be twice as many skilled, well-paid jobs in America as Americans qualified to fill them.  What struck me most of all was Geoffrey Canada's confidence that a charter school run on his model can make virtually any first-grader a high school graduate who's accepted to college. A good education, therefore, is not ruled out by poverty, uneducated parents or crime- and drug-infested neighborhoods. In fact, those are the very areas where he has success. Consider this: Those lotteries are truly random, as by law they must be. Yet most of the winners will succeed, and half the losers (from the same human pool) will fail. This is an indictment: Our schools do not work. Our nation is willing to spend trillions on war and billions to support the world's largest prison population rate. Here is my modest proposal: Spend less money on prisons and more money on education. Reduce our military burden and put that money into education. In 20 years, you would have more useful citizens, less crime and no less national security. It's so simple.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Soul Kitchen", "Review": "Zinos Kazantzakis looks like a mop-topped, mutton-chopped, slightly overstuffed dolma doing its best to stand upright. He's the Greek-German proprietor of a funky hangout in a run-down industrial area of Hamburg, Germany, that serves up soul music nightly, mostly on vinyl platters from the '60s and '70s. On the side, there's some less-than-soulful comfort food \u2014 mainly fries and pizza \u2014 to help soak up the booze and fuel the action on the dance floor. Zinos (Adam Bousdoukos) is having trouble remaining erect for several reasons. He has injured a disc in his back, causing him to move about in pain like a stiff-necked ostrich; his girlfriend is moving to China and is mad he won't come with her; his brother is on work release from prison and is asking him for a job; he's just hired a hot-tempered chef whose talents are way too haute for Soul Kitchen; he's being pursued by real estate speculators, tax officials, the health department. In short, all the breaks are breaking bad for Zinos. Advertisement Acclaimed director Fatih Akin, born in Hamburg to Turkish parents, is best known for the emotionally harrowing \"Head On\" (2004) and the transcendent \"The Edge of Heaven\" (2007). \"Soul Kitchen\" couldn't be more unlike those movies; it's a shaggy, messy, screwy comedy based on the food-industry experiences of Bousdoukos, the film's star and Akin's best friend since childhood.  That puts the loose-limbed groove of \"Soul Kitchen\" into perspective: Yes, this is the kind of movie you might make for, about and with your best friend, for no other reason than to have fun recapturing a period in your lives when you spent a lot of time at a \"third place,\" eating, drinking, dancing and listening to music late into the night, every night. The first thing I did after watching \"Soul Kitchen\" was to go online and find out where I could order or download the soundtrack album, which features the likes of Curtis Mayfield, Kool and the Gang, Quincy Jones, Mongo Santamaria, Ruth Brown and Boogaloo Joe Jones. The next thing I did was grab a pizza. That seemed in line with Zinos' priorities, too. When he hires chef Shayn Weiss (Birol Unel, star of \"Head-On\"), a culinary artiste too proud of his work to serve \"hot gazpacho\" to a customer who doesn't know what gazpacho is, the regulars revolt. They want their proletarian grease, starch and cheese. So, what should he do: give them something better, or give them what they want?  If \"Inception\" was Christopher Nolan's allegory for the making of movies, \"Soul Kitchen\" might be seen as Akin's playful commentary on the demands of the marketplace. (The lightweight \"Soul Kitchen\" has only begun to open in the United States, but it's already taken in $17 million worldwide, only slightly less than \"The Edge of Heaven,\" which won Akin the best screenplay award at the Cannes Film Festival.) The comedy in this joint is as familiar as the food. There's hardly a novel gag in the place, and nearly every scene is built around one, but maybe that's the point (and part of the charm). After all, it doesn't pretend to be anything but a goofy, affectionate comedy that combines slapstick pratfalls with bawdy jokes. Guess what happens when the dessert is spiked with Honduran tree bark, a potent aphrodisiac? Or when Zinos prepares to indulge in a little Skype-sex with his girlfriend in Shanghai, via a battered PowerBook with iSight webcam?  Advertisement \"Soul Kitchen\" can frequently be seen straining for laughs, but it's saved from terminal dopiness by the enthusiasm of its actors, especially Bousdoukos as the hapless puppydog Zinos and Moritz Bleibtreu (\"Run Lola Run,\" \"The Baader-Meinhof Complex\") as his convict brother Illias, an underachieving grifter who sports a skinny little beard that seems to trace his mouth in a permanent pout, as if to emphasize his put-upon status.  Yeah, these guys are losers, but this is a comedy of the heart. Conventions of the form must be respected. So, after everything that could conceivably go wrong goes wrong for these two, things just as suddenly (and randomly) start looking up. It's silly, but it feels pretty good."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Alien Trespass", "Review": "\"Alien Trespass\" is a sincere attempt to make a film that looks like one of those 1950s B movies where a monster from outer space terrorizes a town, which was almost always in the desert. A town, to save on extras and travel. In the desert, because if you headed east from Hollywood, that's where you were, and if you headed west, you were making a pirate picture. \"Alien Trespass\" is in color, which in the 1950s was uncommon, but otherwise, it's a knowing replication of the look and feel of those pictures, about things with jaws, tentacles, claws, weapons that shot sparks, and eyes that shot laser beams at people, only they weren't known as laser beams but as Deadly Rays. Advertisement Facing them are plucky locals, dressed in work clothes from Sears, standing behind their open car doors and looking up to match awkward special effects that are coming -- coming! -- this way! \"Alien Trespass\" doesn't bend over backward to be \"bad.\" It tries to be the best bad movie that it can be. A lot of its deliberate badness involves effects some viewers might not notice. For example: bad back projection in shots looking back from the dashboard at people in the front seat. In the 1950s, before CGI, the car never left the sound stage and in the rear window, they projected footage of what it was allegedly driving past. Since people were presumed not to study the rear window intently, they got away with murder. A decade earlier, in \"Casablanca,\" Rick and Ilsa drove from the Champs-Elysees to the countryside instantly. The plot: Astronomer Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack) and his sexpot wife, Lana (Jody Thompson), are grilling cow-sized steaks in the backyard when something shoots overhead and crashes in the mountains. The sexpot wife is an accurate touch: The monster genre cast pinups like Mamie Van Doren and Cleo Moore, who were featured on the poster with Deadly Rays shooting down their cleavage. Ted goes to investigate. When he returns, his body has been usurped by Urp, an alien. Urp means well. He needs help to track down another alien who arrived on the same flying saucer. He's named the Ghota, which has one eye, enough to qualify it as a BEM, or a Bug-Eyed Monster. The Ghota consumes people in order to grow, divide and conquer. Sort of like B.O.B. in the new \"Monster vs. Aliens,\" which is also a send-up of 1950s BEM movies. So far, Todd Haynes' \"Far From Heaven\" (2002) is the only movie ever made in tribute to a great movie of the 1950s. The Ghota is battled by Urp and his plucky new buddy, Tammy (Jenni Baird), a local waitress who is a lot more game than Lana. As nearly as I can recall, in the 1950s good girls were never named Lana and bad ones were never named Tammy. There are also hapless but earnest local cops (Robert Patrick and Dan Lauria), and an assortment of threatened townspeople. Also great shots of the Lewis family home, separated from the desert by a white picket fence, surrounded by the age-old story of the shifting, whispering sands. Advertisement \"Alien Trespass,\" directed by R.W. Goodwin (\"The X-Files\" on TV), from a script by Steven P. Fisher, is obviously a labor of love. But why? Is there a demand for cheesy 1950s sci-fi movies not met by the existing supply? Will younger audiences consider it to be merely inept, and not inept with an artistic intention? Here is a movie more suited to ComicCon or the World Science Fiction Convention than to your neighborhood multiplex. If you must see a science-fiction movie about a threat from beyond the Earth, there's one right now that I think is great: \"Knowing.\" If you're looking for a bad sci-fi movie about a threat, etc., most of the nation's critics mistakenly believe it qualifies. How can you lose? From beyond the stars -- a mysterious force strikes terror into the hearts of men!"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Far from the Madding Crowd", "Review": "One of the co-founders of the stripped-down Dogme 95 aesthetic might not sound like the most logical choice to direct Thomas Hardy\u2019s classic, sweeping romance \u201cFar From the Madding Crowd.\u201d But Thomas Vinterberg creates a rich aesthetic that combines both vibrant colors and intimate natural light. Whether his film is lush or rolling in the muck, it always has a tactile quality that makes it accessible, which is also true of the performances from his (mostly) well-chosen cast. Carey Mulligan is radiant as the fiercely independent Bathsheba Everdene, a literary heroine who remains so vital, she inspired author Suzanne Collins when she was choosing a last name for the courageous Katniss in the \u201cHunger Games\u201d series. Mulligan plays the part quite differently from Julie Christie, who was luminous but a bit more flirty and playful when she starred as Bathsheba in John Schlesinger\u2019s 1967 adaptation of the novel (which was a bit of a slog at nearly three hours). Christie\u2019s Bathsheba used her girlishness and dazzling looks to assert herself in male-dominated Victorian England. Advertisement Mulligan\u2019s simply does not care what anyone thinks of her, which makes her even more exciting to watch. She\u2019ll seek someone\u2019s advice, but she probably won\u2019t follow it\u2014especially when it comes to the complicated love life she never thought she wanted. After strong work in such eclectic films as \u201cAn Education\u201d (which earned her an Oscar nomination), \u201cDrive,\u201d \u201cNever Let Me Go\u201d and \u201cInside Llewyn Davis,\u201d this might just be the performance of her career. There\u2019s power behind the depth of her voice that provides a fascinating contradiction with her birdlike frame, and a directness to her that\u2019s reminiscent of a young Katharine Hepburn. When Bathsheba tells the staff of the farm she\u2019s recently inherited, \u201cIt is my intention to astonish you all\u201d\u2014in a bit of a tweak of that famous line from screenwriter David Nicholls\u2014her conviction is clear. Bathsheba\u2019s path to happiness, however, is far more circuitous. \u201cFar From the Madding Crowd\u201d is all about the capriciousness of fate, and the way it can drastically alter the trajectory of a young woman who thinks she knows exactly what she wants in a place that's meant to be sedate and safe. You lose a scarf in the woods, or you show up at the wrong church for a wedding, or you send an impetuous valentine to a near stranger and suddenly, several lives have changed. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen captures the equally variable rural surroundings with breathtaking style, from lens flares on a sunny day and verdant, rolling hills to pinky-purple sunsets and morning streaks of misty light. At the film\u2019s start, the orphaned but educated Bathsheba is living on a farm with her aunt in 1870 Dorset, about 200 miles outside London. When we first see her, she\u2019s riding exuberantly across the countryside on horseback before leaning backward nimbly to avoid the scrapes of tree branches. (It\u2019s all so symbolic, this early attempt to emerge unscathed.) But the beautiful Bathsheba catches the eye of a nearby sheep farmer, a gentle giant named Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts). Her freedom is the very quality about her that appeals to him; he quickly asks her to marry him and is quickly rejected. Schoenaerts, the Belgian star of the Oscar-nominated \u201cBullhead\u201d and the Marion Cotillard drama \u201cRust and Bone,\u201d offers an ideal combination of physicality and sensitivity, and he has strong chemistry with Mulligan from the start. Advertisement Gabriel and Bathsheba\u2019s paths soon cross again, though, when he loses his flock in disastrous fashion and she inherits a farm from her beloved, deceased uncle. Suddenly, she\u2019s a landowner\u2014and she happens to need a sheepherder. At the same time, she connects (sort of) with the neighboring landowner, the wealthy and socially awkward bachelor William Boldwood (Michael Sheen), inadvertently enlivening sensations in him he never previously knew. Sheen, the veteran of the cast, prompts great sympathy for this lonely but insistent middle-aged man. If the great Peter Finch was more of a wild-eyed, creepy stalker in the last incarnation of \u201cFar From the Madding Crowd,\u201d Sheen makes you want to give him a hug. When Boldwood asks Bathsheba to marry him\u2014and, like Gabriel, offers her a piano as part of the deal\u2014her response is beautiful but brutal: \u201cI have a piano. And I have my own farm. And I have no need for a husband.\" But then she meets Bachelor No. 3\u2014the arrogant and attractive Sgt. Frank Troy (Tom Sturridge)\u2014and suddenly, all her proclamations of self-sufficiency go out the window. In tackling the task of adapting Hardy\u2019s text, Nicholls has abbreviated quite a bit and spelled out some emotions and motivations to expedite matters. Except for a few gaps, this mostly works, and it helps contribute to the film\u2019s surprisingly brisk, engaging pace. But he was wise to retain the famous scene where Sgt. Troy shows off his swordsmanship in the woods, thrusting at Bathsheba from every possible angle in his regal, red uniform, leaving her breathless. It is not exactly the subtlest form of foreplay, but it is the boldest moment in Sturridge\u2019s otherwise strangely restrained performance. Terence Stamp was a force of nature in the role opposite Christie; he was confident and charismatic, obviously dangerous and untrustworthy but irresistible all the same. He was a sexy cad, while Sturridge is more of a pouty lad. It\u2019s hard to believe this is the man who sweeps the headstrong Bathsheba off her feet. Along those lines, Troy\u2019s previous relationship with a servant from Bathsheba\u2019s farm, which is so crucial to understanding his actions, gets short shrift here. It\u2019s a casualty of the screenplay\u2019s cuts and it reduces the presence of the appealing Juno Temple to glorified-cameo status. Still, Gabriel is clearly the man who\u2019s meant for Bathsheba of all the potential suitors pining for her affections. While Boldwood is too prudent and Troy is too much of a party boy, Gabriel obviously represents the middle ground between those extremes. But it\u2019s not about the destination; rather, it\u2019s about the shared friendship, respect and trust that create the foundation for a love that was always meant to be. Just try to stop yourself from swooning. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon", "Review": "\"I\u2019ve met more famous people through Shep Gordon than through anyone else I\u2019ve ever met in my life,\" says one of the famous talking heads populating \"Supermensch,\" the directorial debut of Mike Myers that celebrates a showbiz manager of unusual achievement, one does have to admit.  Gordon, seemingly as likable a prolific wheeler-dealer as you\u2019re ever likely to encounter, rose from abject stoned hippiedom to starmaker at the end of the Age of Aquarius. Chance meetings with Hendrix and Joplin led to an introduction to rock rotters Alice Cooper (the group) and a verbal contract between Gordon and that band\u2019s eponymous singer. A kind of innate showbiz acumen leads Gordon to great innovations on his client\u2019s behalf (he was the guy who planted the live chicken on stage at the infamous Alice Cooper gig that got the artist tagged as a poultry slayer), and by the 40-minute mark of the movie he\u2019s working the same magic for Anne Murray and Teddy Pendergrass. Director Myers is pretty deft at getting his aforementioned talking heads, which range from Stallone to Legase to the personal attach\u00e9 to the Dalai Lama, to make sense of Gordon\u2019s eclecticism.  Advertisement The movie is like sitting at a restaurant with a guy who\u2019s got some of the best stories you\u2019ve heard in your life\u2014provided, that is, that you\u2019re into stories about showbiz. Gordon, it can never be said enough, has met and/or done business with anyone who was ever anyone, and in some peculiar ways\u2014he and Cary Grant had a joint custody arrangement concerning a housecat. Gordon\u2019s genius at showmanship\u2014among other things, he pioneered the \"For Ladies Only\" concerts that shot R&B love man Pendergrass\u2019 career into the stratosphere\u2014is, per this portrait, matched only by his menschiness. Gordon, who has a distinct speaking style and infectious laugh, speaks of his philosophy of \"compassionate business\" as he recounts, with confidence but some modesty, how he put the business affairs of Groucho Marx in order. The recounting of some literally astonishing acts of generosity makes you like the guy quite a bit, in spite of his having sported a\u00a0 \"No Head, No Backstage Pass\" t-shirt for a good portion of his drug-fueled \u201870s heyday. (And while his taste in music was all over the map, his accomplishments as a movie co-producer were refreshingly daring; he had a hand in bringing such pictures as \"Koyaanisqatsi\" and \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" into theaters.) It\u2019s the generosity, we suspect, that moved Myers, who first met Gordon through \"Wayne\u2019s World,\" in which Alice Cooper appeared, to craft this loving portrait. He punctuates his talking head segments with animation sequences, flashes of punchline imagery, and the occasional cheeky caption, such as the description of CBC staple Gordon Pinsent as \"Famous Canadian.\" It\u2019s pretty entertaining and at times almost educational\u2014Gordon\u2019s account of how, and why, he created the category of celebrity chef is a short course in modern-day branding, for better or worse. The movie\u2019s nutritional value, documentary wise, is pretty dubious in other respects, though; youngsters watching this are likely to come away with the impression that Alice Cooper was always a solo act rather than the front man of a band, none of the other members of which make an appearance here."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The China Hustle", "Review": "Corruption is a word associated with both the Chinese government and the American stock exchange, and in \u201cThe China Hustle,\u201d director Jed Rothstein demonstrates the devastating effects when two corrupt systems cross-pollinate. The film fits squarely into the trendy subgenre of financial corruption documentaries that have propagated since the 2008 housing crisis. Slick and meticulous in its explanations of financial phenomenon like shorting (a quick refresher for those who saw \u201cThe Big Short\u201d), \u201cThe China Hustle\u201d lets its many players tell the story through interviews about their shady involvement, their visages framed through cold, sober lights. These are fraudsters, lawyers, businessmen-turned activists; some are frank and honest, others mealy-mouthed and defensive. Advertisement \u201cThere are no good guys in this story, including me,\u201d starts Dan David, a hedge-fund manager whose company was wiped clean by the 2008 financial horror show. For companies like David\u2019s, and stock trading corporations like Roth Capital Partners and Rodman & Renshaw, incorporating Chinese companies into the American stock exchange offered a new fork in the path, one that didn\u2019t end with bankruptcy. A loophole in the system called a reverse merger allowed cheap stock of nearly defunct American companies to act as proxies for Chinese companies\u2014a win-win for everybody. \u201cThe China Hustle\u201d then details the unsurprising reveal that these foreign investments were greatly overvalued. Subsequent sleuthing scenes ensue, in which American businessmen, like Muddy Waters\u2019 founder Carson Block, sneakily survey the physical grounds of paper mills and other companies. The facilities are low-volume and appear deserted; one had a large swathe of rotting cardboard instead of real product worth the billions of dollars the company claimed on its American financial receipts. The fallout from these discoveries caused the more conscientious involved parties, like David, to jump ship immediately. They refused to participate in the system and sold their overinflated stocks. Dave started working on making real change through Congress (which the film reveals to be a frustrating, Sisyphean task). Rothstein\u2019s attempts to interview the increasingly hostile retired general Wesley Clark, whose company Rodman & Renshaw continued profiting from the fraud, runs out of steam at this point, and the doc\u2019s piping-hot energy also begins to peter out. As infuriating as men like Clark may be, their squinty-faced denials in front of the camera are hardly satisfying for the viewer. The frank, level-headed tone of the documentary does not transform into the righteous anger that such financial corruption calls for. \u201cThe China Hustle\u201d calls into question the broader purpose of films like it (there\u2019s also \u201cDirty Money,\u201d a new Netflix series by Alex Gibney\u2014who serves as executive producer on \u201cThe China Hustle\u201d\u2014in which stories of corruption are doled out in bingeable one-hour chunks). These films and series are great at visually explaining hard-to-understand financial concepts and tapping into the knowledge and voices of professionals who\u2019ve had to explain them a million times over to their clients. But they tend to stop short at suggesting real social change. In the case of \u201cThe China Hustle,\u201d Rothstein resigns himself to including post-scripts about the billions of dollars stockbrokers in the know have gotten away with. Great. Is there anything the American people can do to fight the system, or help David\u2019s cause? \u201cThe China Hustle\u201d is not interested in offering a crumb of hope, thereby enabling the frustration it will inevitably arouse in viewers to dissolve into apathy once the credits roll.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "3", "Review": "Tom Tykwer's \"3,\" also known as \"Three\" or \"Drei,\" is an art film treatment of what in more vulgar genres would be called a threesome. It contains a good many sex scenes, but have you noticed recently how many orgasms in the movies are desperate, aggressive or sad \u2014 anything but ecstatic? The most that can be said for the characters here is they all seem mighty pleased. The movie involves a 40-ish couple in Berlin who have a \"committed relationship\" but are not married because of all the usual weaselly reasons. Hanna (Sophie Rois) hosts a TV talk show about culture. Simon (Sebastian Schipper) runs a company that constructs large works of art for sculptors and suchlike. They get along warmly enough after 20 years together, but the excitement is fading. One night Hanna goes out for drinks after a show, and Simon learns from a doctor that he has testicular cancer. The doc says it's curable but surgery should be done quickly \u2014 like, now.  Advertisement Simon can't get Sophie on her cell phone. She is preoccupied. The removal of one of Simon's precious spheres is required, and we learn along with Simon that this surgery is now done under local anesthetic; presumably just as a woman might want to be conscious during childbirth, a man wouldn't want to miss the halving of his family jewels. The guilty tumor is deposited in a steel pan with a little \"clink.\" I would have expected more of a little plop. This Simon, what a man. Hanna has met a man named Adam (Devid Striesow). One thing leads to another, and without planning to, they have intercourse. Neither one was hungering for sex, but it seemed like a good idea at the time, and if anything, it makes Hanna friendlier with Simon after his inventory has been reduced. Not long after, in a modernistic and isolated swimming pool, Simon meets Adam in the locker room and somehow the conversation gets around to losing testicles. Adam asks for a look, and before long, they're having sex. What you need to know about Adam is that he is not sex mad, not a predator, not aggressive. We sense he is a very nice man with a friendly smile. He isn't bisexual so much as accommodating. We learn a little more about the lives of Simon and Hanna in visual displays by director Tom Tykwer (\"Run, Lola, Run\") that use flashbacks, imaginings and possibilities, mixed up with snatches of everyday life, bites of television, and a compressed edition of the two parallel love affairs as they develop. What's crucial is that nice young Adam doesn't have the slightest idea Hanna and Simon are a couple. He likes them both, they both like him, but it's an excellent question how they'd all feel if the cards were on the table. \"3\" is, in short, a melodrama that otherwise could easily become a farce. But Tyk\u00adwer reins in the performances; his characters are intelligent, have gone into this situation with no desire to hurt anyone and are involved in the kind of realignment that can happen in midlife.  The film is successful in an absorbing sort of way, but underwhelming. Devid Striesow's performance as Adam is important in its modulation. More affection is involved than lust, more curiosity than need. If he's not with the one he loves, he loves the one he's with."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Love Crime", "Review": "Alain Corneau's \"Love Crime\" is a diabolical mystery movie with one of those plots where we suppose we understand everything that's happening, and then get the rug pulled out from under us. It's a contest of will between two women executives in the French headquarters of an American multinational, and involves bloodthirsty office skullduggery and intrigue. The two lead performances make it work, even if the plot eventually seems devious for its own sake. Kristin Scott Thomas, once again fluently bilingual, plays Christine, the boss, who is one step away from being promoted to the American office. When we first see her with Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier), they're in Christine's home working on business while Christine's affection for her protege shows hints of being more personal. Is she really attracted to the younger woman, or just trying to seduce her loyalty? She speaks tenderly, touches her gently, gives her a scarf. Advertisement When Isabelle discovers she also has taken credit for her work, she's stunned. Christine smoothly explains that it's the way corporations work; it's known as teamwork. Isabelle seems to be a naive and vulnerable underling, compared to Christine's cold-eyed calculation. Intrigue deepens as Christine sends her lover, Philippe (Patrick Mille), with Isabelle on a business trip to Cairo, they sleep together and that triggers Christine's fury against them both. The screws tighten. Philippe is trapped. Now Isabelle feels betrayed by both. A friendly colleague opens her eyes to office secrets, setting in motion a labyrinthine plot in which the seemingly naive young woman turns out to be more than the equal of her boss. Spoiler: I must reveal that Christine is murdered. I won't say who does it. Isabelle is arrested and brought before a conscientious magistrate, and the police assemble a damning case against her, all based on circumstantial evidence. Demoralized by pills, deeply depressed, Isabelle confesses. But then the whole plot turns on itself. One of the pleasures is watching the gears mesh. The screenplay has been written by Corneau and Nathalie Carter with meticulous attention to detail. Like classic mystery authors, they play fair, so that the surprises at the end are consistent with what we've seen \u2014 although we didn't realize it at the time. Kristin Scott Thomas is good at roles like these, with a combination of sensuality and ruthlessness. Her fluency in the language has given her a new career as a French star, at a time when French filmmakers are more interested than Americans in middle-aged women. The movie depends, however, on Ludivine Sagnier, who is convincing both in early scenes when she's helpless and clueless, and later when she holds the cards and pulls the strings. This is the final film by Alain Corneau, who died last year at 67. His best film was \"Tous Les Matins Du Monde\" (1991), which starred Gerard Depardieu in one of his best performances as a regretful old musician. He also directed a favorite of mine, \"Fear and Trembling\" (2003), which also involved two women in competition. \"Love Crime\" is equally involving. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Warm Bodies", "Review": "As much as I enjoy \"The Walking Dead\" on AMC and movies such as \"28 Days Later,\" one of my ongoing complaints about the explosion of the zombie genre is the general mopery and overall predictability of those ever-staggering creatures. They lurch. They snarl. They sniff the air for the scent of human flesh. They pounce and gnaw. They pound windows and doors, and express frustration when confronted with 10-foot-high cyclone fences. And then they get shot in the head and die. That's pretty much it. We almost never get inside the rotted mind of the zombie or see things from the zombie point of view. They're forever penned in as the Big Metaphor. Advertisement One of the many exhilarating pleasures of \"Warm Bodies\" is the flipping of that script. This is a bloody fresh twist on the most popular horror genre of this century, with none-too-subtle echoes of a certain star-crossed romance that harks back to a certain bard who placed a certain young Romeo under a certain balcony. I kinda love this movie. \"Warm Bodies\" is a well-paced, nicely directed, post-apocalyptic love story with a terrific sense of humor and the, um, guts to be unabashedly romantic and unapologetically optimistic. Looking a little like a boy-band heartthrob who won first place at a Hollywood Halloween party thanks to a a professional makeup job and an artfully bloodied red hoodie, Nicholas Hoult gives an earnest and winning performance as \"R,\" who could be a character in \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" or a John Hughes movie, if not for the small fact he's undead, having been recently zombified. (R's attempt to fill us in on the exact nature of the zombie apocalypse is one of the film's many affectionate nods to the all-too-familiar elements of so many zombie TV shows and movies.) Unable to recall even his full first name (he's pretty sure it begins with the letter R), the kid knows he's a zombie and doesn't deny his hunger for living human flesh \u2014 but there are still traces of a real person inside. He spends his days lurching about an airport where he imagines the previous lives of his fellow zombies, listens to music in the grounded airplane he's converted into something of a condo and establishes the beginnings of a bond with M (Rob Corddry in a scene-stealing performance), who also seems to have more than a trace of his former humanity still lurking deep within. Advertisement Working from Isaac Marion's short story-turned-novel, writer-director Jonathan Levine infuses \"Warm Bodies\" with stylistic flourishes and winking in-jokes \u2014 some of them subtle, some so obvious characters are compelled to comment on them. (\"What? It's funny!\" says the delightful Analeigh Tipton when she chooses a particular song to accompany a makeover montage.) There are three distinct species populating the Earth post-worldwide infection nightmare: Humans. They're scarred from seeing spouses, children and friends turned into zombies or killed, but they're armed and they WILL shoot any corpse that comes within growling distance of their walled city. Zombies. Wandering the streets, living in airports and warehouses, always on the alert for the next human meal. Maybe hopelessly lost. Maybe not. \"The Bonies.\" Zombies that have given up all hope and have resorted to tearing off their own flesh, leaving behind skeletal killing creatures that would just as soon take down a zombie as a human. There's a key difference between the dead and the really and truly dead \u2014 a difference that comes to light when R strikes up a bond with Julie (Teresa Palmer). Granted, their \"meet cute\" involves mass slaughter and the consumption of one character's brains, which allows a zombie to access a dead character's memory. But other than those small details, the courtship of R and Julie isn't all that different from what we've seen in any number of human/human as well as human/supernatural creature romances, including the \"Twilight\" movies. Hoult and Palmer have a lovely, natural chemistry, even when the circumstances are grisly or silly \u2014 or both. Perhaps recognizing there's no way he can out-crazy the material, John Malkovich actually delivers a relatively restrained performance as Julie's father, who of course is the leader of the military force that believes in shooting first, asking questions never. This guy's so hard-core, he probably wouldn't let his daughter date Tim Tebow, let alone a zombie who's desperately trying to get in touch with his human side. (\"That could have gone better,\" says Julie with deadpan understatement after Dad finally meets R.) Advertisement \"Warm Bodies\" isn't perfect. It's a shame those Bonies are mediocre special-effects creations that run with a herky-jerky style that would have been mocked by the 1991-era \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" liquid-metal dude. Some of the musical choices are too broad and easy. And even after we get the message, the message is delivered at least two or three more times. But those are minor drawbacks. Clocking in at a brisk 97 minutes, \"Warm Bodies\" is terrific entertainment.\u00a0 A lot of zombie movies have heart \u2014 but usually the heart ends up on someone's plate. Cheers to \"Warm Bodies\" for taking us in a different direction for a change."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Captain America: Civil War", "Review": "The bad news is, there are about ten movies going on in \"Captain America: Civil War,\" which is at least seven too many. The good news is, most of them are fun, and there are enough rousing moments to elevate the movie to Marvel's top tier. Although Thor, the Hulk and other recurring characters have gone missing this time (with somewhat vague explanations for their absence), nobody's going to mistake \"Civil War\" for a chamber piece. Trailers sold this installment as a tale of intra-Avengers warfare, set off by the government's demand that Captain America (Chris Evans) allow the arrest of his old friend The Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), an assassin whose moral compass has been scrambled by brainwashing, so that he can be punished for his presumed role in a terrorist attack. And it is that. But only some of the time. Advertisement There are more than a dozen major characters and another dozen minor \r\nones, including Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), all running, flying, stomping and blasting through a long, lumpy story inspired by the \r\n2006 Civil War graphic novel arc. Thematically, it's potluck. Like \"Avengers: The Age of Ultron,\" \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Iron Man 3,\" \"Civil War\" is simultaneously about the ramifications of US intervention in a post-9/11 world; the responsibility of private military contractors (which is basically what the Avengers are here) to defer to their government and the United Nations; the question of whether civilian casualties negate the righteousness of a noble mission; the allure and price of vengeance; and individuals' ongoing, never-finished struggles to understand how their pasts drive their present-tense actions. (Several characters confess that they act from compulsion and then find ways to rationalize it.) There's a fair bit of \"The Dark Knight\" logic, or \"logic,\" to the \r\nstorytelling. Characters do things to other characters because they know\r\n it'll set off a chain reaction that'll eventually lead to a very specific \r\nmoment at the end; luckily for them, each step goes according to \r\nplan, because if it didn't there would be no movie. And, as in the inferior yet thematically similar \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" the hero-versus-hero slugfest only seems \r\nto spring from real and deep philosophical differences. It turns out that the real problem is that these \r\ncharacters don't talk to each other when they should.  All that said,\r\n this is a satisfying film that takes its characters but not itself \r\nseriously, and mixes sequences of wonder, visual \r\nwit and pathos in with the world-building and dramatic housekeeping. \r\nReuniting the Cap creative team of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and \r\nscreenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, \"Civil War\" gets better as it goes along, both as an action movie and a sprawling ensemble. I've seen reviews complaining that no character gets enough screen time, but to me the distribution felt just about right. We know a lot about the established characters by now. There's not much this film needs to say about Peter Parker except that he's a lovable wise-ass spider-teen who lives with his Aunt May (51-year old Marisa Tomei, looking more like Aunt February) and has only been slinging web for six months. Nor does this story require much more of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) but that he act starstruck by Tony and Cap and the gang and try too hard. Black Panther, aka T'Challa\u2014subject of an upcoming Ryan Coogler solo movie\u2014is defined by his righteous anger over an injustice perpetrated against his family and his nation, and that's exactly where the character needs to be for this film.  Advertisement The action is solid, sometimes inspired. The best setpiece in \"Winter Soldier,\" Cap taking out a bunch of would-be assassins in an elevator, had a frenzied smallness that was much more exciting than watching helicarriers crash and monuments crumble; it seems to have inspired the better action scenes here\u2014not just a stairwell punch-fest that finds Bucky swinging from a torn-up stretch of railing like Tarzan on a vine, but in a bigger, louder, wilder clash between Avengers (including emergency ringers Spider-Man, Ant-Man and Black Panther) on an airport runway. Although the cliched handheld, whipsaw-crazy action still lacks beauty and personality (a problem throughout Marvel's filmography, which has an assembly line quality) it's clean and exact, it makes clever use of the various heroes' powers, it's more comedic than vicious (Buster Keaton and Steven Spielberg are clear influences), and it leaves no doubt about the characters' angles and methods of attack, where they are in relation to one another, and what's at stake. The script never convincingly squares this film's vision of Cap as a guy who's willing to go it alone against government forces (led by William Hurt's Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross) who want to regulate super-heroic interventions with the Captain America of \"The Winter Soldier,\" who decided he'd rather go against his own government than allow one of its highest ranking military officials to order extrajudicial assassinations. \"We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own,\" Cap tells Tony, a sentiment that could easily have been placed in the mouth of Robert Redford's \"Winter Soldier\" character Alexander Pierce. It's as if Cap is a hypocrite who thinks vigilantism is OK as long as he's the vigilante\u2014which would be a solid point if anyone in this movie raised it.  Seems to me that Iron Man industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), with his cowboy capitalist inclinations, would be a more likely candidate to espouse the positions Cap embraces here. True, Stark is troubled by seeing Cap, the Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) cause innocent Wakandan relief workers to die while trying to stop the heist of biological weapons in Lagos, Nigeria, and he's genuinely shamed by an encounter with a state department employee (Alfre Woodard) whose son perished during the final battle in \"The Age of Ultron.\" Still, the philosophical positioning of Cap in relation to Tony feels a bit \"take our word for it.\" (I bet it worked better on the page.) Advertisement But the Russos' deft switching between slapstick and melodrama, the surprising outcomes of key storylines, and the strength of the central performances go a long way towards overcoming nitpicks. Much has been written about DC Films' fashionable darkening of Superman, but the loss of the big blue Boy Scout doesn't sting as much as it would if we didn't have Cap around to fill that imaginative space. Evans has a bit of Christopher Reeve's magic. He's as nice as a screen hero can be without seeming dull. (The directors make the comparison official in a scene that evokes memories of the Daily Planet helipad disaster in the 1978 \"Superman.\" Watch how Cap solves the problem\u2014it's not just about super-strength, it's about figuring out what to do with his legs and arms.) Cap's straightforward goodness is a tonic in an age of grit for grit's sake, and his quiet scenes with Bucky have an un-ironic emotional charge that's ultimately more radical than Batman and Superman's glowering in Zack Snyder's recent mope-fest.  I missed the kooky, at times cryptically obsessive quality that Joss Whedon brought to \"The Age of Ultron,\" but this is a smoother, more consistent film with its own oddball moments, such as Paul Bettany's Vision making paprikash for Scarlet Witch while listening to Chet Baker, and Falcon's startling name-check of racist police officer Mark Furhman. I'm not sure Marvel's film slate will ever overcome charges that the series is less cinema than a giant-screen TV series that makes you wait several months for a new episode. But I don't think the filmmakers or the fans care about those distinctions. These are late capitalist America's version of Greek gods, running, jumping and flying through stories that are as contradictory and self-defeating as the country that spawned them. They often claim they're destroying the world in order to save it, but they don't really know why they do things. They're mysteries to themselves. The deeper Marvel dives into those mysteries, the more artful and memorable this franchise will become."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Still Life", "Review": "The Beatles song \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d famously imagines its\r\neponymous heroine as a solitary spinster who attends a wedding wearing \u201ca face\r\nthat she keeps in a jar by the door,\u201d then dies and is given a funeral to which\r\n\u201cnobody came.\u201d \u201cAll the lonely people, where do they all come from?\u201d the chorus\r\nmournfully wonders.\u201d \u201cAll the lonely people, where do they all belong?\u201d The British drama \u201cStill Life\u201d by writer-director Uberto\r\nPasolini is pretty much an exact cinematic equivalent of Paul McCartney\u2019s\r\ndowncast lament. It begins with three funerals, of different faiths, at which\r\nthere is only one mourner, the same in each case. He is John May (Eddie Marsan), a\r\nshort, square-ish fortysomething who not only attends such funerals but also\r\narranges them and even writes their eulogies. Advertisement This is his job, but it has also become something of a\r\nmission, even an obsession. May works for a council in south London where he\u2019s\r\nassigned to arrange for the burials of people who die without any relatives or\r\nintimates to assist with their passage out of this life. Much like Eleanor\r\nRigby. There seems to be a steady stream of such folk, since May has been\r\nemployed for over two decades. And the government evidently has the largesse to\r\nallow him to pay for proper funerals, each with a clergyman, music, a good\r\ncasket and a decent burial. Since they have no one else, May regards the deceased as\r\n\u201chis\u201d people, and he goes to extra lengths to serve them well. Researching\r\ntheir lives as exhaustively as limited time and resources allow, he constructs\r\nthe most favorable life narrative for each that he can, and this becomes the\r\nperson\u2019s eulogy. He also tracks down any lost relatives or friends and tries to\r\npersuade them to attend the last rites \u2013 usually without success. Otherwise, May\u2019s life appears to be neat, clean and empty.\r\nHe\u2019s like an amalgam of the protagonists of Henry James\u2019 \u201cThe Altar of the\r\nDead\u201d and T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cPrufrock\u201d \u2013 devoted to his dear departed while living a\r\nlife measured out with \u201ccoffee spoons.\u201d After establishing May\u2019s routines and rituals, the story\r\ntake a turn when a young, officious new superior calls him in and tells his job\r\nis being consolidated out of existence. Apparently the bureaucracy would rather\r\npay for simple cremations rather than funerals, and has no need for his\r\npersonal attention to detail. Stunned that he\u2019s only got a few days left being\r\npaid to pursue the quest that\u2019s occupied his adult life, May finds a last case\r\nthat he gradually begins treating as a grand cause. Advertisement As it happens, the deceased lived across from him,\r\nsuggesting how modern city life divides communities into solitary cells. The\r\nman\u2019s body had not been discovered for many days, but May enters his shabby,\r\nsmelly apartment and, with his usual meticulousness, begins picking through his\r\nbelongings (partly filled photo album, old LPs), looking for clues. The portrait that emerges is one of a drunken, abusive,\r\nne\u2019er-do-well, just the kind of guy who would die alone and unlamented. But\r\nthat doesn\u2019t deter May, who puts his usual detective skills into high gear and\r\ntracks down a number of people who knew the man. They\u2019re generally not happy to\r\nhear his name mentioned. A woman who runs a seaside fish and chips shop, who was\r\nhis girlfriend two decades before, recalls him as violent and impetuous. Two\r\nhomeless men, who served with him in the Falklands War, say much the same but\r\nallow that his roughness was useful in training for combat. May also finds the man\u2019s grown-up daughter (Joanna Froggat)\r\nworking in a rural center for rescued dogs \u2013 a job that signals something of\r\nher feelings of abandonment. The last time she saw her dad, she says, he was in\r\nprison and punched out a guard. She\u2019s grateful to May that he\u2019s let her know the\r\nsad news, but she doesn\u2019t want any further involvement with her father\u2026until\r\nshe changes her mind and calls the messenger back, sparking a connection\r\nbetween two lonely people that propels the tale\u2019s third act toward an ending in\r\nwhich sudden surprise is followed by a bit of magical-realist uplift. The film\u2019s title says lots about its mood and style, which\r\nis heavy on becalmed views of rooms, objects like an apple peel and office\r\nutensils, and May\u2019s glazed gazes at nothing in particular. Pasolini (formerly a\r\nproducer of films including \u201cThe Big Monty\u201d) says this approach is indebted to\r\nlate Ozu, but it\u2019s also one shared by many European art films of the\r\ndownbeat-humanist sort. In terms of atmosphere, it conveys a kind of drab\r\nordinariness that, for some reason, in English films, comes across as\r\nexceptionally dull, constricted and depressing. Advertisement The nuanced particularity pays its best dividends in the\r\nexacting, flavorful performances, especially Marsan\u2019s Mr. May, who has a face\r\nlike a squashed grapefruit, with doleful eyes, a looming nose and a stretched\r\nmouth that only really smiles when he meets his last client\u2019s daughter. Whether\r\nfilmgoers want to join his journey will be a matter of individual taste. Though\r\nthe film\u2019s lachrymose gist is conveyed with subtlety and insight into the\r\nrigors of loneliness and mortality, it is lachrymose nonetheless. Fans of\r\n\u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d in any case, should not miss it."}
{"Stars": 0.5, "Title": "Plush", "Review": "What happened to Catherine Hardwicke? With every new film she chooses to direct, she drifts farther away from the early ones that put her on the map: her 2003 debut, the teen drama \"thirteen,\" and her 2005 skateboarding adventure \"Lords of Dogtown.\" These were stripped-down films with a immediacy, relatable emotions and a vivid sense of place.\u00a0Then came 2006's \"The Nativity Story,\" which seemed to have been made by an entirely different person; it was so overly earnest, it felt like it belonged on the Hallmark Channel, and in retrospect is a blip. Advertisement The first \"Twilight\" movie from 2008 was a good fit for her outrageous sense of style and her knack for depicting the angst of youth. It also opened at nearly $70 million, the biggest debut for a female director\u2014which, in theory, should have opened countless doors and allowed Hardwicke to make any sort of film she wanted.\u00a0And so she made the soapy, chintzy \"Red Riding Hood\" (2011), which suggested what it might look like if the \"Twilight\" kids got dressed up and went to the Renaissance Faire.\u00a0 Her latest film is the clunky \"Plush,\" a psychological thriller set in the Los Angeles rock scene.\u00a0It feels so inauthentic at every turn, it's as if the film itself is unsure of what it's supposed to be. Camp? Not camp? A cautionary tale? A rock 'n' roll fable? A tragic example of obsession? Or maybe just an excuse to wallow in debauchery?\u00a0It does feature some of he most lifeless and unconvincing concert scenes I've ever seen; meanwhile, the backstage moments consist of nonstop smoking and champagne swilling, shorthand for danger and self-destruction. Heavy narration over a long opening flashback is meant to fill in some of the emotional gaps, but it's just one of many examples of the film spelling out everything. Hayley (Emily Browning in Goth-chick mode) explains in detail how she and her beloved brother, Jack (Thomas Dekker), grew up in Texas writing and singing their own songs.\u00a0\"Music was like our secret place,\" she says in girlish, wistful tones. \"Nothing could hurt us because Jack and I had each other.\" In no time, they've moved to Los Angeles and formed a band called Plush. At 19, she's pregnant with twin boys and marrying a hunky journalist named Carter, played by Cam Gigandet. (\"Carter's daughter, Lila, was our flower girl,\" Hayley explains in one of the more awkward pieces of voiceover in the script from Hardwicke and Arty Nelson. \"She lives with her mom half the time.\")  Plush is a smash, which inspires all the creepy fan worship and drug abuse you might expect. Then one night after a concert, Jack overdoses on heroin, sending Hayley reeling. She records a new album in his honor with painfully literal lyrics like: \"Half of me is gone.\" Audiences and critics reject it, sending her into a further spiral. She thinks she's found her savior in the band's new guitarist, Enzo (Xavier Samuel, who recently played Naomi Watts' surfing son in the mom-swapping drama \"Adore\"). Not only does he know all her old songs, he inspires her to push through her own limits in writing new ones.\u00a0Unfortunately, Enzo may also be bisexual, and a stalker. That's not a spoiler, by the way: the tattoo right above Enzo's butt crack of both Hayley and Jack's pictures gives his orientation away, and the stalker part is telegraphed as well.\u00a0 Advertisement From here, \"Plush\" follows the eye-linered Enzo's  efforts to insinuate himself in Hayley's life while Hayley remains oblivious to  just how deranged he truly is. \u00a0The presence of an odd and officious new nanny for the family (Frances Fisher, in a sweeping up-do and a cape) is no coincidence; she's exactly who you think she is. Meanwhile, increasingly threatening gifts keep showing up from a demanding fan. Who could possibly be sending them??? All of this should have been more darkly funny, more knowingly campy, something. As it is, \"Plush\" awkwardly tries to shock and frighten us while also trying to tease and amuse us.  Browning has come a long way from playing the innocent girl in \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,\" as evidenced by her starring role in Zack Snyder's fetishistic extravaganza \"Sucker Punch,\" and by \"Sleeping Beauty,\" in which she's naked pretty much the entire time. She's up for any challenge, and has the striking, clear-eyed look of a doll come to life, but this was one risky role that didn't pay off. At one point toward the end of \"Plush,\" as tensions are mounting and Carter is taking out his jealousy by doing manly yard work, Enzo shoots a video for Hayley's new single. Filled with bondage imagery and disturbing, sepia-toned jump cuts, it's a straight-up rip-off of the famous Mark Romanek clip for the Nine Inch Nails hit \"Closer.\" But it also might just be the best part of the film."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq", "Review": "Many documentaries about ballet and its practitioners, even the very best, understandably appeal mainly to a core audience of dance aficionados. Nancy Buirski's mesmerizing, beautifully crafted \"Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil le Clercq\" proves a striking exception to that rule. While it does profile the work of brilliant dancer, the film also contains two complex and moving love stories as well an account of a physically devastating tragedy followed by an extraordinary tale of struggle and survival.  Advertisement Tanaquil le Clercq was a muse and love interest of two of the last century's greatest American choreographers, George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins. Born in Paris in 1929 and raised in privileged, sheltered circumstances in New York, Tanny, as her friends called her, started studying dance as a child and was at Balanchine's School of American Ballet when he discovered her. Though she was only 15, he cast her in lead roles and she quickly became a star, having never served in the corps de ballet.  Her skill as a dancer is evident in the clips director Nancy Buirski provides, but le Clercq was also helped, clearly, by her looks. Tall, svelte and long-legged at a time when most ballerinas were short, she exuded a coltish energy and cut a striking figure on stage. Her face also had a distinctive allure, a mixture of simplicity and understated ethereality, like a more angular Julie Harris with a bit of Lauren Bacall's youthful insouciance.  Already middle-aged when he met her, the Russian-born Balanchine had a history of depending creatively and emotionally on his prima ballerinas. He had married four of them before he met Tanny, and all had eventually left him (rather than the other way around) when it seemed their artistic partnership had run its course. With Tanny, the pattern repeated, but from the testimony of those who knew them, the love on both sides was profound. They married in 1952.  Robbins, a bit older than Tanny, was infatuated with her from the time they met, and said she was the reason he decided to the join the New York City Ballet and work under Balanchine. Some of the most moving parts of the film are excerpts from letters between Jerry and Tanny (read by actors) that bespeak a complex mix of friendship and romantic feeling, one that was destined to leave him both enthralled and frustrated. He apparently was crushed when she married Balanchine.  In 1956, the company went off on a European tour at a time when the specter of polio was terrorizing much of the world. While most of the dancers took the newly invented Salk vaccine before they left, Tanny decided at the last minute not to. She was stricken in Copenhagen and put in an iron lung with expectations that she would not survive. She did pull through, but would never walk, much less dance, again.  Advertisement The sudden horror of the dancer's illness and her struggle in its aftermath are where the film's fascinating chronicle of a talented artist's ascent turns even more absorbing. In a strange way, it seems that though Tanny's emotions are roiled by her drastic change of fortunes, her spirit is largely unchanged, and perhaps even strengthened. In any case, Balanchine remains an ardent support through her treatment in Warm Springs, GA, and return to New York. And while she complains that Robbins is an erratic correspondent, his letters and photos of her make it clear that his attachment to her is as strong as ever.  Those photos make the point that, where some documentaries need a copious amount of material on their subjects, others manage to turn a paucity of sources into an advantage. Here, there were only a couple of Tanny interviews during her career for Buirski to draw on, and none following her illness (le Clercq died in 2000), and the archival footage of her dancing of course came well before the era of HD and snazzy production values.  But precisely these limitations help draw the viewer even more deeply into Buirski's portrait of the dancer. Watching Tanny's luminous countenance in Robbins' expressive photos or the post-polio Super-8 movies made by friends, one senses a truly amazing spirit blessed with an insight, a warmth and a generosity that were far beyond the normal. As one of her intimates says, \"her regard was all acceptance, forgiveness.\"  Ultimately, a great film about a single person touches upon the mystery of human personality, and \"Afternoon of a Faun\" does that with uncommon grace. While some viewers are sure to come away from the film wishing they had seen Tanny dance, perhaps even more would wish they had been able to spend an afternoon in the park with her.  It should be noted that Buirski and editor Damian Rodriguez have done a superb job of telling their story through interviews and footage of dances that, though old, remain striking. The most hypnotic of all, which opens and closes the film, is from the eponymous \"Afternoon of a Faun\" piece that Robbins created for Tanny and Jacques d'Amboise. In an old black and white kinescope, the dancers perform as in a studio, but with the camera where the mirror should be. Somehow the effect is spell-binding even decades later, proof of the magic that two figures on a bare stage can create. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Obvious Child", "Review": "Writer-director Gillian Robespierre's \"Obvious Child\" arrives with the buzz of Sundance behind it, and the unfortunate buzz of being billed as the first \"abortion comedy.\" Those words are a bit misleading. \"Obvious Child\" is definitely a comedy, and it also deals with abortion. But the approach is not glib or casual. It's a film that is really about the behavior of its main characters, the rhythms of conversations, the unexpected moments that surprise, and the sudden flashes of feeling that act as an ambush. It's a whirlwind. It touches on themes of arrested development, needing to grow up and to accept responsibility for who you are (both onstage and off, the film being about a standup comedian who uses her own life story in her act), but \"Obvious Child\" is not ponderous with these themes. Advertisement \"Obvious Child\" starts in a small stand-up club in Brooklyn, the kind of place with seven or eight tables and a unisex bathroom covered in graffiti. The comics who show up all have bigger dreams, they have agents, they just sold a pilot. The film opens with Donna (Jenny Slate) on-stage, in the midst of doing a set, one that is immediately disarming, honest and legitimately funny. It feels unscripted. It's a bit of a mess. Her delivery is spontaneous, even down to moments where she loses track of what she is saying and has to find her way back to the joke. She gets an enthusiastic response from the audience. But her boyfriend, smoldering in the back, feels differently about being used as a prop in her comedy, and breaks up with her. The breakup scene is when I first sensed that \"Obvious Child\" was working on a unique wavelength. She is truly crushed at the turn of events. Donna is not just a wise-cracking broad, using her comedy to keep people at bay, or joke her way out of living a serious life (although that is part of it). Comedy is not pathologized here, although the impulse to get up and talk about your life in front of others is examined in interesting ways. Donna is vulnerable and that vulnerability is part of her act. The concept of using one's life as fodder for your art is an underlying motif of \"Obvious Child,\" and it comes back again and again, seen through different angles of the prism. Sometimes Donna hits it out of the park. Other times, like when she goes on-stage wasted, in the wake of the breakup, and rambles on incessantly to an increasingly embarrassed audience, she falls flat on her face. Donna is almost thirty, and still babied by her parents (Richard Kind and Polly Draper), she is a clerk in a bookstore called \"Unoppressive Non-Imperialst Books,\" and lives with her roommate Nellie (an excellent Gaby Hoffman). One drunken night at the club, she goes home with a guy named Max (Jake Lacy), who is not a comedian, is in business school, and seems taken with Donna's aggressive brand of conversation (despite the fact that he also has a hard time keeping up with it). They cavort around. They laugh. They have sex. It's all a part of her breakup tailspin. Advertisement When she finds herself pregnant a couple of weeks later, she doesn't know what the hell to do. Max keeps showing up in her life. He seems to want to go on dates now. Should she tell him he got her pregnant? She barely knows him. Unlike in Judd Apatow's \"Knocked Up,\" with a similar circumstance and where abortion is not even mentioned by name (except for the cowardly \"schma-shmortion\"), \"Obvious Child\" is honest. There are moments of gallows humor. There are moments of deep pain and struggle. There's one great scene when Donna is in the back of a cab, and she decides to go talk to her mother so she asks the cab driver if he can turn around and go back to Manhattan. His response is rude, albeit in a cursory way, and yet she is so lost and scared that she dissolves into sobs in the back seat. Slate manages to give us a character who has walls and a certain persona, and yet that persona constantly cracks. It's part of her act; it's part of what she \"uses\" for comedy. Her emotions come up against her will. When she is able to harness them, she is funny and even charming. When they get the better of her, she goes down with the ship. You can understand why Donna has loyal friends who put up with all of that. And it's also completely plausible that Max enjoys her so much. He's a subtext kind of guy. He listens to what isn't being said. He is not completely overrun by the onslaught of her wisecracks, and sometimes gives as good as he gets. He is taken aback by her dirty jokes, but isn't judgmental. \"On the page,\" Max may seem like a cliche. But as portrayed by Lacy, he feels like a real guy, someone you've met, someone you know. There are a couple of coincidences in the script that feel artificial, and there's a bit too much reliance on second-unit shots of Manhattan landscapes to get us from one scene to the next. But what is interesting here is the behavior, the subtext coursing beneath the text, the feeling that what comes up for these people is too big to be controlled, and yet they still try to control it. Romantic films, even good ones, often operate from cliche. \"Obvious Child\", an extremely self-aware film, acknowledges those cliches, and yet provides the characters a larger and more chaotic space to be themselves. The film is not anti-romantic. In many ways, it is extremely romantic. Watch Donna's reaction to when Max warms up the butter packets with his hands before giving them to her. It is an automatic gesture on his part, casual, and yet it says everything. She is nearly undone by the moment. \"Obvious Child\" is Robespierre's first feature, and it is an incredibly confident debut. Watching all of these people listen, talk, behave, react, think, work stuff out\u2026that's the genius of \"Obvious Child,\" that's the strength and beauty of its unique wavelength.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "The Loft", "Review": "In\r\npreparing to review the new thriller \"The Loft,\" I was surprised to\r\ndiscover that not only is it a remake of a 2008 film that was an enormous hit\r\nin its native Belgium, it was previously remade in the Netherlands in\r\n2010--indeed, the film's director, Erik van Looy, not only helmed the original\r\nbut also worked on the Dutch version as well. I am not surprised by the fact\r\nthat this story has been told three times in such a short period of time--hey,\r\nthe beloved classic \"The Maltese Falcon\" was actually the third\r\ncinematic go-around for that tale in less than a decade. No, what surprises me\r\nis that I would have thought that by this third stab at this particular\r\nnarrative, all of the implausibilities and idiocies would have been ironed out.\r\nAlas, this long-delayed would-be erotic thriller is a shabby bore that promises\r\nviewers any number of kinky thrills and then proceeds to deflate those\r\nexpectations. Advertisement The film\r\ncenters around five pals\u2014smarmy architect Vincent (Karl Urban), nice guy\r\npsychiatrist Chris (James Marsden), quiet nebbish Luke (Wentworth Miller),\r\nloudmouth horndog Marty (Eric Stonestreet) and borderline psychopath/Chris's\r\nhalf-brother Philip (Matthias Schoenaerts, another refugee from the Belgian\r\noriginal)\u2014who are in marriages that are not particularly satisfying to them\r\nfor various reasons. Assuming that they all desperately want to cheat on their\r\nwives but are leery of doing for fear of getting caught, Vincent hits upon the\r\nperfect solution\u2014the five of them will quietly purchase a spacious loft\r\napartment in a new building that he has designed and use it for their assignations.\r\nThere are any number of reasons to instantly reject such a proposal as being\r\nimpractical at best and idiotic at worst (Who washes the sheets? What happens\r\nif two of them show up at the same time? What if one of them threatens to\r\nblackmail the others in order to get out of his turn doing the dishes?) but\r\nnone of them occur to them and they all sign on. For a\r\nwhile, all goes well and even the initially reluctant Chris joins in the fun as\r\nwell once he meets the sexy Anne (Rachael Taylor), the sister of a former\r\npatient who committed suicide. However, it is all fun and games until someone\r\ndies a horrible death, and indeed, one morning, Luke arrives to discover the\r\ncorpse of a strange blonde handcuffed to the bed with her wrist slashed. After\r\nthe others arrive, it becomes apparent that since there are only five keys to\r\nthe loft, one of them has to have been at least somewhat involved in the girl's\r\ndeath. While they try to piece together what happened and who is hiding what,\r\nwe are treated to a series of extended flashbacks that reveal more about the\r\nguys, their increasingly twisted relationships with their women and with each\r\nother, the identity of the suicide blonde and the circumstances that presumably\r\nled at least one of them to commit murder.  In other\r\nwords, \"The Loft\" is like a combination of \"The Apartment,\"\r\nminus the caustic wit and interesting characters, \"Reservoir Dogs\"\r\nsans the powerful sexual tension and a below-average episode of \"Law &\r\nOrder SVU.\" Actually, that description makes it sound far more interesting\r\nthan it actually is. Having never seen the first two versions, I cannot say for\r\ncertain how this one compares to its ancestors but either something got\r\nhorribly lost in the translation or it the Belgians and Dutch are a lot more\r\nforgiving when it comes to substandard thrillers. The plot is a convoluted mess\r\nthat veers back and forth in time with little rhyme or reason and is never\r\nclose to being as smart and clever as it thinks it is. Screenwriter Wesley\r\nStrick completely drops the ball here\u2014the dialogue is trite, the characters\r\nare paper-thin and universally unpleasant and uninteresting and the denouement\r\nis borderline laughable in its attempts to tie all of the plot lines together\r\nwhile still yanking the rug out from under viewers. Advertisement As for van Looy (whose 2003 thriller \"The\r\nMemory of a Killer\" is as good as this one is awful), he appears to be on\r\nautopilot the entire time, presumably out of sheer boredom, because there is\r\nnot one cinematically interesting moment to be had. The actors are pretty much\r\ncoasting throughout as well for the most part with as little energy and\r\nenthusiasm as possible. The one exception to this is Eric Stonestreet, who\r\nseems so thrilled at the prospect of playing a character so different from the one\r\nhe portrays on \"Modern Family\" that he overplays every scene to the\r\npoint where you may find yourself involuntarily flinching every time he comes\r\non screen. As for the women, they\r\nare pretty much depicted throughout as either shrews or prostitutes and the\r\nfilm's ultimate attitude towards them can probably be divined by the fact that\r\nthe\u00a0 two main actresses\u2014Taylor and\r\nIsabel Lucas\u2014are refugees from the \"Transfomers\" franchise.  \"The\r\nLoft\" is a film that seems to have been designed specifically to appear in\r\nempty theaters in the dead of January. It is a total wash as a thriller, it is\r\ntoo clunky and simplistic to work as a mystery, it has no insights into male\r\npsychology that could make it work as a drama and its erotic quotient is so\r\nminimal that it could only be a turn-on to people who consider HGTV to be\r\npornography. The best thing about it is that it is so utterly disposable that\r\nit will quickly be forgotten and everyone involved can go on to presumably\r\nbetter things."}

Rounding out the\r\nfoursome are Matthias Schoenaerts as Swinton\u2019s hunky, younger lover and Dakota\r\nJohnson as the slinky, seductive daughter Fiennes\u2019 character only recently\r\nrealized he had. Their lengthy backstories and newfound alliances reveal\r\nthemselves over the course of a seemingly idyllic vacation at a picturesque\r\nvilla on the Italian island of Pantelleria, where the threat of a sirocco\r\nstirring things up even further is constant. Cinematographer Yorick\r\nLe Saux (who also shot Guadagnino\u2019s gorgeous \u201cI Am Love\u201d) luxuriates in them\r\nall as they bask and tangle in the sun and in and out of a swimming pool that\r\nwill become increasingly crucial as the film progresses. (\u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d is\r\na loose remake of the 1969 Jacques Deray film \u201cLa piscine.\u201d) Schoenaerts\u2019 pecs,\r\nJohnson\u2019s torso, Fiennes\u2019 smile and even Swinton\u2019s feet are all monuments to be\r\nworshipped as much as the cool, blue Mediterranean Sea or the imposing volcanic\r\nboulders that surround it. Swinton stars as\r\nMarianne Lane, a Bowie-esque rock star whom we first glimpse in metallic\r\nsequins and face paint, taking the stage to the deafening chants of an adoring\r\nstadium crowd. But soon, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s forcing herself not to speak\r\nmuch less sing; she and Schoenaerts\u2019 Paul, a photographer and documentarian,\r\nhave retreated to this remote paradise to allow Marianne to rest and recover\r\nher voice. Guadagnino, working from\r\na script by David Kajganich, efficiently and vividly establishes the bohemian\r\nyet domesticated life Marianne and Paul have created for themselves, full of\r\nnude sunbathing, midday lovemaking and long soaks in the nearby mud baths. Advertisement The noisy, unexpected\r\narrival of Fiennes\u2019 Harry, Marianne\u2019s longtime friend and record producer,\r\ninterrupts their reverie. Turns out Harry not only was Marianne\u2019s lover for six\r\nyears, he\u2019s also the man who introduced her to Paul (and gave them his blessing to\r\nlaunch into their own romance\u2014a decision he now regrets). Harry has shown up\r\nwith the blonde, leggy Penelope (Johnson), who alternates between making\r\ninsults and inappropriate come-ons. She insists she\u2019s 22 although her impetuousness\r\nsuggests otherwise, and \u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d allows Johnson to be both funnier and\r\nsexier than she was in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d Tensions mount as the\r\ndays pass, the wind blows harder and dustier and the villa seems to grow\r\nsmaller and more suffocating. Harry breaks through all that, though\u2014or\r\nperhaps he\u2019s just oblivious by inviting random friends over, regaling them with\r\ntales of his rock-music glory days, playing Rolling Stones records and showing\r\noff his moves like Jagger. This sequence may actually be the highlight in a\r\nmovie filled with strong and striking visuals: the sight of Fiennes in an\r\nunbuttoned shirt and swim trunks joyously letting \u201cEmotional Rescue\u201d radiate\r\nfrom every fiber in his being. He\u2019s never been so much fun to watch\u2014not even\r\nwhen he got to vamp it up as Voldemort. Guadagnino ratchets up\r\nthe feeling of claustrophobia with extreme close-ups that ignite the senses:\r\nhands gutting a fish or peeling fruit, eyes as they survey the other\r\ncharacters, a mouth moving with non-stop chatter and laughter.\u00a0Marianne\r\ncould easily be a contemporary rock-star\u2014Swinton is a timeless and towering\r\nfigure, after all\u2014but Guadagnino\u2019s use of zooms and pans suggests an homage\r\nto European psychological dramas like the film\u2019s source material. He\u2019s created\r\na concoction that\u2019s sexy and strange all at once. Advertisement But then \u201cA Bigger\r\nSplash\u201d goes slack and silly toward the end, just as it should be at its most\r\ngripping. A ghastly discovery almost seems like it\u2019s being played for laughs.\r\nIn fact, because the film is so precise for long in both its beauty and its\r\nweirdness, the tonal shift toward uncomfortable farce feels that much more\r\ndisappointing. Guadagnino also tries to drop in hints about the plight of\r\nTunisian refugees\u00a0arriving on the island seeking sanctuary\r\nbut they never really resonate or cohere with the story as a whole. \u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d might\r\nbe intended as a cautionary tale about the perils of being white, beautiful and\r\nprivileged\u2014but it\u2019ll probably register more as a dazzling escape."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Detroit Unleaded", "Review": "\"Detroit Unleaded\" was a great idea. A lot has been written lately about the city's depressed condition. Similarly, small storefront businesses run by immigrants in American urban ghettos have become standard hood movie tropes, but usually as experienced from the customer's side of the counter. This indie comedy aspires to take us into the heart of crumbling Detroit and behind the bullet-proof glass of a gas station/convenience store. The trouble here is a lack of texture and urgency, despite a rapid visual pace that bounces around inside the convenience store and environs like the best movies in this subgenre, \"Do the Right Thing\", \"Car Wash\" and \"Friday\". There simply is no neighborhood personality here as vibrant as Chris Tucker's Smokey, or as believable in his lunacy as Bill Nunn's Radio Raheem. The filmmaker's cart is tugging frantically at a lazy horse. Advertisement That might be forgivable if the the romantic leads in the story, Sami (EJ Assi), the Lebanese-American heir to his family's gas station and Naj (Nada Shouhayib), a beautiful Arab-American cell phone store clerk, had explosive chemistry or greeted the obstacles to their courtship with something more than mild irritation. These are comely, personable kids, but a friend of mine summed up their general mall greeter affect by saying, of Assi, \"He's good looking enough to be in a movie. Wait, he is in one.\" The movie itself forgets, too, giving us tidily cute moments that suggest a decent NBC sitcom pilot. Tension is what this movie cries out for\u2014sexual, \r\nracial, cultural, class\u2026. As a variety of urban types pass through Sami's store, director Rola \r\nNashef offers only superficial evidence that their dramas and dilemmas crowd and exasperate this restless 20-something, who commutes from suburban Dearborn to the purgatorial job that forced him to drop out of college (!). There's also the under-explored thread of grudging affection between the mostly black strivers/hustlers/working stiffs and their Middle Eastern counterparts. The film opens with a burst of suggested violence that further hints at a lot bolder, blacker (in the dramatic sense) comedy. A handgun even reappears as the classical tragic omen, but there's rarely any sense of real investment or vulnerability in Assi's performance. Underneath it all, Nashef hides a strong and worthwhile multicultural vision. It's just visible in this sketch of a movie, so I hope she comes back to it with real force and ambition (not just the commercial calling card variety) next time around. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Restrepo", "Review": "\"Afghanistan\u201d is a word on the news, debated in terms of our foreign policy. Almost an abstraction. Nobody thinks about foreign policy in \u201cRestrepo,\u201d a documentary shot during the 15 months an American company fought there under almost daily fire. They were in the Korangal Valley, described on CNN as \u201cthe most dangerous place in the world.\u201d  It is also one of the most desolate, even in the arid land of Afghanistan. Sparse vegetation clings to the rocky, jagged terrain. There is dust everywhere. It is too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter, and in the movie, at least, the troops only actually ever see one Taliban fighter \u2014 and the man who saw him thought it was the last sight he would ever see. Advertisement The Taliban is an elusive presence, moving freely through the landscape and population, and there is one point when the company is ambushed and takes fire from 360 degrees. That all of them were not killed seem surprising. The film is named after the first one of their number to die, a 20-year-old medic, Pfc. Juan S. Restrepo. Battle Company is led by Capt. Dan Kearney, whose plan is to establish an outpost at a key point on Taliban battle routes. The men occupy the position at night and start digging in, using earth to build fortifications. They catch the enemy off-guard. The successful maintenance of Outpost Restrepo, named for their dead comrade, turns the tide of war in the hostile valley and frightens the Taliban. But the hearts and minds of the locals remain an uncharted terrain. Kearney holds a weekly council with the local elders, a group of men who could not look more aged, toothless and decrepit if they tried. A portrait of one would be all you needed to suggest the poverty of the region. One elder complains he has lost a cow. It's explained that the cow became tangled in razor wire and had to be put out of its misery. He is offered compensation: The cow's weight in rice, beans and sugar. He wants cash. His heart and mind are not won. The location footage is intercut with debriefings of the survivors conducted soon after they've been flown out to Italy. They use understatement to express strong emotions. The deaths of men they fought with are almost impossible for them to speak of. The memory of Restrepo lived on in the guitar lessons he provided and his book of flamenco songs. He was a great favorite. After Outpost Restrepo grew from a dugout into a proper position with shelter and fortifications, they felt right having named it for him. They all speak with special dread about an operation named Operation Rock Avalanche, fought through deadly country. They come under fire three, four, five times a day. There are many firefights in the film, but they all share one feature: We never see the enemy, and we never see the American targets.  This is hard, hard duty. A 15-month tour. Our admiration for these men grows. Their jobs seem beyond conceiving. I cannot imagine a civilian thinking he could perform them. It would take much training \u2014 and more important, much bonding. There is the sense they're fighting for each other more than for ideology. At a low point when a nearby company has taken heavy losses, Kearney talks to his men not in terms of patriotism, but in terms of finding the mofos who are shooting at them, and going out and killing them. The film is nonpolitical. It was filmed at great personal risk by the war photographer Tim Hetherington and the author Sebastian Junger (The Perfect Storm). It raises for me an obvious question: How can this war possibly be won? At the end, a title tells us U.S. troops withdrew from the Korangal Valley and therefore Outpost Restrepo in 2010.

{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "The Golden Compass", "Review": "\"The Golden Compass\" is a darker, deeper fantasy epic than the \"Rings\" trilogy, \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" or the \"Potter\" films. It springs from the same British world of quasi-philosophical magic, but creates more complex villains and poses more intriguing questions. As a visual experience, it is superb. As an escapist fantasy, it is challenging. Teenagers may be absorbed and younger children may be captivated; some kids in between may be a little conflicted, because its implications are murky. Advertisement They weren't murky in the original 1995 novel, part of the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman, a best seller in Britain, less so here. Pullman's evil force, called the Magisterium in the books, represents organized religion, and his series is about no less than the death of God, who he depicts as an aged, spent force. This version by New Line Cinema and writer-director Chris Weitz (\"About a Boy\") leaves aside religion and God, and presents the Magisterium as sort of a Soviet dictatorship or Big Brother. The books have been attacked by American Christians over questions of religion; their popularity in the U.K. may represent more confident believers whose response to other beliefs is to respond, rather than suppress. For most families, such questions will be beside the point. Attentive as I was, I was unable to find anything anti-religious in the movie, which works above all as an adventure. The film centers on a young girl named Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), in an alternative universe vaguely like Victorian England. An orphan raised by the scholars of a university not unlike Oxford or Cambridge, she is the niece of Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), who entrusts her with the last surviving Alethiometer, or Golden Compass, a device that quite simply tells the truth. The Magisterium has a horror of the truth, because it represents an alternative to its thought control; the battle in the movie is about no less than man's preservation of free will. Lyra's friend Roger (Ben Walker) disappears, one of many recently kidnapped children, and Lyra hears rumors that the Magisterium has taken them to an Arctic hideaway. At her college, she meets Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who suspiciously offers her a trip to the north aboard one of those fantasy airships that looks like it may be powered by steam. And the adventure proper begins. I should explain that in this world, everyone has a spirit, or daemon, which is visible, audible and accompanies them everywhere. When they are with children, these spirits are shape-shifters, but gradually they settle into a shape appropriate for the adult who matures. Lyra's is a chattering little creature who can be a ferret, mouse, fox, cat, even a moth. When two characters threaten each other, their daemons lead the fight. Advertisement Turns out the Magisterium is experimenting on the captured children by removing their souls and using what's left as obedient servants without free will. Lyra challenges this practice, after taking the advice of the grizzled pilot Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott) to find herself an armored bear. She enlists the magnificent bear Iorek, who must duel to the death with the top bear of the north. She also finds such friends as a flying witch named Serafina (Eva Green) and some pirate types named Gyptians, whose lifestyle resembles seafaring gypsies. The struggle involves a mysterious cosmic substance named Dust, which embodies free will and other properties the Magisterium wants to remove from human possibility. By \"mysterious,\" I mean that Dust appears throughout the movie as a cloud of dancing particles, from which emerge people, places and possibilities, but I have no idea under which rules it operates. Possibly it represents our human inheritance if dogma did not interfere. As Lyra, Dakota Blue Richards is a delightful find, a British-American schoolgirl who was 12 when she was discovered in an audition involving 10,000 girls. She is pretty, plucky, forceful, self-possessed, charismatic, and just about plausible as the mistress of an armored bear and the protector of Dust. Nicole Kidman projects a severe beauty in keeping with the sinister Mrs. Coulter (had Pullman heard about our girl Ann when he wrote his book?), and Daniel Craig and Sam Elliott (with his famous moustache never more formidable) give her refined and rough surfaces to play against. The cast is jammed with the usual roll call of stage and screen greats, some of them in person, some of them voice-over talent: Christopher Lee, Tom Courtenay, Derek Jacobi, Simon McBurney, Ian McKellen, Ian McShane, Kathy Bates, Kristin Scott Thomas. The British fantasy industry has become a bigger employer even than the old Hammer horror films. And why is it, by the way, that such tales seem to require British accents? I realize this review itself may be murky, because theological considerations confuse the flow. Let me just say that I think \"The Golden Compass\" is a wonderfully good-looking movie, with exciting passages and a captivating heroine in Lyra. That the controversy surrounding it obscures its function as a splendid entertainment. That for adults, it will not be boring or too simplistic. And that I still don't understand how they know what the symbols on the Golden Compass represent, but it certainly seems articulate.

{"Stars": 0.5, "Title": "All Eyez on Me", "Review": "\u201cAll Eyez on Me\u201d is one of the most useless music biopics ever made\u2014it\u2019ll be too confusing for newcomers and too underwhelming for those familiar with the work and the life of rap prophet Tupac Shakur. Directed by Benny Boom with minuscule passion and a ruthless 140-minute running time, \u201cAll Eyez on Me\u201d is a production that coasts on the bare minimum of biopic requirements, boasting a lead who looks very much like Tupac but nothing that can\u2019t be learned from a Wikipedia page, or better yet, the 2003 documentary \u201cTupac: Resurrection.\u201d As it merely seeks to canonize a complex figure who was far more interesting than perfection, \u201cAll Eyez on Me\u201d dehumanizes an important man. \u00a0 Advertisement There are so many fascinating parts to Tupac\u2019s 25 years on Earth: his upbringing in a family of Black Panthers and mostly women; his young interest in acting and Shakespeare; his ascent in the pop charts as a no-holds-barred storyteller; and, of course, the debate about the merit of his obscene lyrics, especially in regards to treatment of women and animosity towards the police. Boom\u2019s film overzealously hits all of these (unless it\u2019s something that makes Tupac look bad) and compiles them like a greatest hits collection that only features the simple choruses and never the contemplative verses. Moments are flattened, diced and spoken through cliches, like when Tupac defends his teen pregnancy song \u201cBrenda\u2019s Got a Baby\u201d to a couple of white record executives, or when he later realizes that because the world is watching him closely, he should name his album \u2026 well, you get it. As the editing leaps from one Important Moment to the next, the timeline becomes confusing and bold-faced, underlined emotions never resonate.\u00a0 There is no air in this movie\u2014the kind of air that turns faces on the big screen into our thoughtful surrogates, regardless as to whether the character is fictional or not. Demetrius Shipp Jr.\u2019s invested performance of Tupac is reduced to an impersonation, and an essential part of the rapper is underestimated: his mind. This version of Tupac is always doing, in service of presenting all that he did but not so much what was going on on the inside. Aside from hammy moments in which he surveys a concert crowd with a bright spotlight on him, he\u2019s rarely shown simply thinking, considering. Even when the narrative framing device of an interview in prison creates exposition out of Tupac debating himself with his interviewee, it\u2019s pithy and cheap.\u00a0 \u201cAll Eyez on Me\u201d\u2019s most accomplished factor might be its third act, in which Tupac joins Death Row Records and signs a deal with the devilish Suge Knight (Dominic L. Santana). It functions like a tacky gangster movie of heavy glares and heated confrontations, all while leaning heavily on the \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d-esque elements of Tupac\u2019s last months. But Boom's lifeless direction still taunts, like when we have to watch Shipp lip-sync to Tupac songs for ten minutes or so during a concert, or watch numerous macho confrontations play out with the camerawork of soap operas.\u00a0 Advertisement Although the movie is wholly allergic to nuance, there is some shred of an emotional arc that arises with the relationship Tupac has with his mother, Afeni Shakur (Danai Gurira). She appears throughout the movie as a force that challenges Tupac in one way or the other. Gurira too has to work with rotten dialogue and cliche situations, but it\u2019s the one glimmer that feels like an expression instead of a duplication.\u00a0 For everyone else, including Tupac, Boom\u2019s biopic is more concerned with information than humanity, and eventually Boom\u2019s shallow dedication to showing us recognizable moments or outfits becomes plainly goofy. I especially loved the man who played Snoop Dogg and then lip-synced his dialogue with that of the real Snoop\u2019s voice (or it sounded very much like it). The soundtrack soon enough elicits more giggles than head bobs, with the movie cramming in as many songs as possible, despite having no problem skipping around a short career timeline from album to album, underestimating the creation of such pivotal songs in the process.\u00a0 Boom\u2019s counterproductive answer to the flawed aspects of Tupac is to deny that very complexity and to make him a type of savior, which often makes \u201cAll Eyez on Me\u201d only plainly terrible. However, that defiance of ambiguity becomes mortifying and offensive when Boom contextualizes a controversial sexual assault case\u2014the before, during, and after\u2014within a biopic\u2019s fact, in which the survivor is shown intimately dancing with Tupac to R. Kelly\u2019s \u201cBump & Grind\u201d nights before, and Tupac is presented as sleeping in a different room when she was gang-raped by men he claimed to barely know. Boom even has the audacity to speak for the woman after Tupac was sentenced, when he cuts to her celebrating with her lawyer and then smirking at Tupac. Juxtaposed with the movie\u2019s walking butt close-up establishing shots and the way that women are plainly either mother figures or sexual objects, it\u2019s enough to make you throw up. For whatever Boom and his collaborators may know about Tupac, especially as they present \u201cthe untold story\u201d (to reference marketing), it\u2019s clear with their narrative agenda and values that they\u2019re looking far past what makes Tupac so important. This is a man whose life deserves scrutiny, to explore the many issues that he faced as a young black male artist making record history with a bold definition of Thug Life and a fiery ego that clashed with his self-proclaimed sensitivity. Even more, the story of Tupac is one that deserves true artistry. A Tupac film needs to match the vigor you feel in his freight-train rapping, which did more than just tell you what to think. It allowed you to see his world for yourself. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Maze Runner: The Death Cure", "Review": "The thing about zombies is that they\u2019re hard to kill. Sure, you shoot \u2018em in the head and that\u2019s supposed to do the trick. But when they\u2019re rushing and gnashing and flailing at you\u2014as modern-day zombies tend to do\u2014it can be hard to concentrate and get a good shot. This is especially true when they\u2019re coming at you en masse across a desolate wasteland, the kind you find in so many movies based on Young Adult novels. Such is the sensation of watching \u201cMaze Runner: The\u00a0Death\u00a0Cure,\u201d the third and final film in the series based on James Dashner\u2019s novels. It just\u2026 won\u2019t \u2026 end. For better and for worse, it\u2019s an overwhelming experience. And just when you think it\u2019s over, there\u2019s another coda, and then another. The music will swell to a crescendo, signaling our need to experience peak emotions and planned catharsis, and then there are more loose ends to be tied up, more overly explanatory narration to endure. Advertisement I mean, I get it. It takes a long time to find a\u00a0death\u00a0cure. But come on. For a while, though, Wes Ball\u2019s film moves really well. He\u2019s directed all three installments in the franchise\u2014including 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d and the 2015 follow-up \u201cThe Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\u201d\u2014and what separates his films from the overcrowded field of teen dystopian dramas is his visceral sense of space and energy. Ball\u2019s action sequences have a tangible, accessible quality about them, which is especially true in his doozy of an opening sequence: a 10-minute car chase/train robbery across the desert that\u2019s got a grit, intensity and rough-hewn aesthetic reminiscent of \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d And as is the case in all the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d movies\u2014especially the original\u2014the sound design is powerful and immersive. You certainly would never want to spend any time in the Glade, or the Scorch, or any of the adjacent, post-apocalyptic hellholes, but Ball\u2019s films make you feel as if you\u2019ve done just that. Working from a script by returning writer T.S. Nowlin, he drops us right into the action\u2014there\u2019s no \u201cPreviously on `The Maze Runner \u2026\u2019\u201d\u2014so if you\u2019ve forgotten this place and these characters, you may feel a little lost. Still, there\u2019s no time to worry about that. Our hero, the obligatory YA Chosen One, Thomas (Dylan O\u2019Brien), and his crew must free their friends from the clutches of the bad guys at WCKD. (With an acronym like that, what else could they be?) A team of scientists led by the coolly minimalist Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) and a team of law enforcement agents led by the relentlessly evil Janson (Aidan Gillen) maintain control of the imposing Last City. (No, really, that\u2019s what it\u2019s called.) Simultaneously, they\u2019re still rounding up all the remaining children and performing experiments on them to see who is immune and can provide a serum to\u00a0cure\u00a0this decimated world of the zombie plague. The man at the center, O\u2019Brien, remains hardworking and blandly handsome, but at least he\u2019s got compelling figures surrounding him to help him sneak inside and burn it all down. They\u2019re mostly character actors with intriguing screen presences and captivating faces: Rosa Salazar, Giancarlo Esposito, Barry Pepper, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Ki Hong Lee, Dexter Darden and an almost unrecognizable Walton Goggins. They are overqualified for this noisy nonsense. But they also bring an effortless multiculturalism to these movies that I\u2019ve always appreciated, and they all get a moment to shine. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to the strong women who play crucial roles in the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d universe, from the villainous Clarkson to the virtuous Salazar to Kaya Scodelario as Thomas\u2019 would-be love interest, whose inner conflict leaves her facing tough decisions somewhere in the middle. Advertisement None of these characters or their stories is nearly as engaging as the movie\u2019s many gonzo action sequences, though. Besides the one that opens the film with a bang, there\u2019s a thrilling one toward the end involving a crane, a bus and a bunch of screaming kids that\u2019s begging to be turned into a theme-park ride. In between are massive shootouts, elaborate hand-to-hand combat and\u00a0death-defying leaps\u2014both physically and of faith. You may forget them all afterward in the blur of teen angst and annihilation that so many of these types of movies provide, but they\u2019re fun while they last.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Big Ass Spider!", "Review": "In addition to having an \"Airplane!\" style exclamation point in its title, \"Big Ass Spider!\" delivers its creature as advertised. That's what you paid to see, and you already know if you want to see it, if you share my love for nature-gone-amuck horror movies, a love that arrived the day I saw \"Food of the Gods\" at the drive-in with my parents. Since then, I've copped to enjoying movies like \"Anaconda,\" \"Deep Blue Sea,\" \"Snakes on a Plane,\" and even the ABC Movie of the Week \"Curse of the Black Widow.\" That one had a horny Patty Duke turning into, you guessed it, a big ass spider.  Advertisement I'm especially fond of vengeance-seeking insects, so this seemed right up my alley. I attended the midnight showing here in New York City, a screening hosted by Lloyd Kaufman. Kaufman is the president of Troma, the studio whose fans are the target audience for \"Big Ass Spider!\" (Full disclosure: Not a lot of people showed up.) A filmmaker sitting in my row sought Kaufman's advice on moviemaking. Apparently the guy had written a movie about big ass horseshoe crabs. As Kaufman and his wife enthusiastically answered his questions, I thought of two of my own: \"What the hell can those pathetic looking horseshoe crabs do to a person?\" and \"When can I find out?\"  This is the mindset you must have if you want to get anything out of \"Big Ass Spider!\" But \"Big Ass Spider!\" has a big ass problem: It thinks you're better than the material. It falls far too often into the \"wink-wink-nudge-nudge\" self-awareness that makes movies like \"Sharknado\" intolerable. Don't get me wrong: It's perfectly fine for a genre picture to wink at its audience, but I've grown weary of this new subgenre whose sole existence is to tell you it's in on the joke. They're so afraid you're all gonna laugh at it that they fire distracting pre-emptive strikes: \"Yes, we KNOW this is bad!\" It's a cinematic self-fulfilling prophecy.   Had \"Big Ass Spider!\" solely been that kind of movie, I would be dismissive rather than disappointed. But this film is crafted with far more love and devotion than the standard Syfy creature of the week movie. It's a horror comedy, and there are moments that work in both categories. Director Mike Mendez (who also edited) has made a decent looking movie on a low budget, and some of his sequences and shots are intriguing and effective. The first scene of the film, done as a flash-forward moment, is visually arresting. An early spider attack featuring a janitor is edited and shot particularly well, with a long shot of the attack played out both in front of us and as shadows on the wall.   Advertisement For a good comedic example, there's a scene where our exterminator hero Alex Mathis (Greg Grunberg) is chasing a littler version of the Big Ass Spider! through a hospital ventilation system. Crawling through the ducts, Alex communicates with his new sidekick Jose (Lombardo Boyar), a security guard serving as his vent system GPS. When Alex encounters a web left by the spider, he marvels at its intricacies and its strength. When Alex's flashlight goes out, he strikes his lighter. This causes his web-covered hands to erupt in huge balls of fire. Grunberg's reaction, and the sheer ridiculousness of the special effects fire, made me laugh harder than I've laughed at the movies this year.  The biggest star here is Ray Wise, who plays a military agent trying to catch the big ass spider and keep things on the hush-hush. Rather than commit to the material like Leslie Nielsen, he looks like he knows this is a bunch of B.S. (Wink-wink, audience!!) Wise is joined by a scientist whose lazily written dialogue is also an audience pander. I missed the overcomplicated science gobbledygook these characters spout. That element of fun is missing from \"Big Ass Spider!\" I'm still not sure how the damn thing got into the body it explodes out of in the opening reel.  To keep Alex from falling in love with his sidekick (with whom he has more chemistry), there's a love interest named Karly (Clare Kramer). She starts out as a tough chick but eventually becomes a damsel in distress. Also on hand is Lin Shaye, who can do no wrong in my book. She shows up in a cameo as a horny old woman with rodent problems. Her perverted near-molestation of Alex made me want to see more of her.  When the Big Ass Spider finally lives up to its name, it goes on a rampage in Los Angeles. These rampage scenes would be more fun if they weren't verbally telegraphed earlier by Wise and company. B.A.S. runs wild, chewing on scantily clad women, police officers, overweight people, helpless seniors\u2026and Lloyd Kaufman. King Kong-like shots of the spider atop the US Bank building in L.A. are intercut with Alex and Jose racing to save Karly and what's left of Los Angeles. This Battle: L.A. is too easily resolved, but I could live with that. However, the last scene of this movie, which I'll not spoil, made me shake my head. (Nudge-nudge, audience!)  Maybe Mendez and company are on to something here, some kind of dual marketing genius. \"Big Ass Spider!\" wants to serve two masters, the ones who unabashedly enjoy this type of movie without shame, and the ones who openly mock it with false senses of superiority. Marketing genius or not, I fall only into the former camp, so I can only meet \"Big Ass Spider!\" halfway. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Sicko", "Review": "If you heard the story, you remember it. A few weeks ago, a woman bled to death in an emergency room, while her husband and a bystander both called 911 to report she was being ignored. They were ignored. She was already in the E.R., wasn't she? Her death came too late to be included in \"Sicko,\" Michael Moore's litany of horrors about the American health care system, which is run for profit, and insurance companies, which pay bonuses to employees who are successful in denying coverage or claims. But wait a minute. I saw the movie almost a year to the day after a cartoid artery burst after surgery and I came within a breath of death. I spent the next nine months in Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, and the Pritikin Longevity Center, and still require the daily care of a nurse. I mention this to indicate I am pretty deeply involved in the health care system. In each and every case, without exception, I have been cared for by doctors who are kind, patient, painstaking and expert, and by nurses who are skilled, wise and tireless. My insurance has covered a small fortune in claims. My wife and I have also paid large sums from our own savings. Advertisement So I have only one complaint, and it is this: Every American should be as fortunate as I have been. As Moore makes clear in his film, some 50 million Americans have no insurance and no way to get it. Many of the insured discover their policies are worthless after insurance investigators reel off an endless list of conditions and procedures that are not covered, or discover \"pre-existing conditions\" the patients \"should\" have known about. One woman, unconscious when she is put into an ambulance, is billed for the trip because her insurer says it was not pre-authorized. How could she get authorization when she was out cold on the pavement? We also learn a lot about drug companies and HMOs in the film. It is an item of faith in some circles that drug companies need their profits to finance research and development. Out of a dollar of profit, what percentage would you guess goes to R&D, and what percentage goes to advertising and promotion, multimillion-dollar executive salaries, corporate jets, palatial headquarters, bonuses and stockholders? Moore plays 1971 tapes from the Oval Office as Nixon discusses the original Kaiser plan for an HMO. \"It's for profit,\" he says admiringly. Have you ever understood exactly what benefit an HMO provides while it stands between you and the medical care system and acts as a toll bridge? Do its profits not depend on supplying as little health care as possible, at the lowest possible price? Moore visits the countries of Canada, England, France and Cuba, all of which have (1) universal health care and (2) a longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the United States. In France, he drives with one of many doctors kept on full-time house-call duty. Of course we have heard all about \"socialized medicine,\" which among many evils denies you freedom of choice of hospitals and doctors. Hold on: That's the free-enterprise HMO system. Moore sails to Cuba with three boatloads of sick people, some of them 9/11 volunteers who have been denied care for respiratory and other problems because they were -- well, volunteers. Unlike firemen and policemen, they had no business being there, I guess. One woman is on $1,000-a-month disability, and needs $240 a month for her inhaler medication. Moore's gimmick (he always has one, but this one is dramatic) is to take her to a Cuban hospital where she finds that her medication costs five cents in Cuba. At least that R&D money is helping Cubans. Advertisement Moore's original purpose in sailing south was to seek medical care for his passengers at the Guantanamo Bay prison base. He is turned away, of course, but not before observing that accused al-Qaeda terrorists get better (free) medical attention than 9/11 volunteers. It's a different Michael Moore in \"Sicko.\" He still wears the baseball cap, but he's onscreen less, not so cocky, not going for so many laughs. He simply tells one story after another about Americans who are sick, dying or dead because we have an undemocratic, profit-gouging health care system. Moore's films usually make conservatives angry. This one is likely to strike home with anyone, left or right, who has had serious illness in the family. Conservative governments in Canada, England and France all support universal health care; the United States is the only developed nation without it. Yes, nitpickers can find fault with any attack on our system. There are four health care lobbyists for every congressman. But there's room for irony when the owner of an anti-Moore Web site can't afford to maintain it when his wife gets sick. And room for tears when a claims investigator for an insurance company tells Congress she knows she was her company's instrument for denying clients care they needed that might have saved their lives."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Unfreedom", "Review": "The first feature by co-writer/director Raj Amit Kumar\r\nbegins by throwing the viewer into a seemingly random series of events, set in\r\nIndia and in the United States\u2014Delhi and New York City to be specific. Kumar\u2019s\r\na pretty busy (I presume he\u2019d prefer the term \u201cdynamic\u201d) cinematic storyteller.\r\nSo between the multiple characters, fast-shifting settings (an artist\u2019s studio\r\nwith a nude female painter stalking around it, the TKTS plaza at Times Square,\r\na backyard barbecue, a changing room for a woman prepping for a wedding, and so\r\non) and eye-opening action (why is the woman prepping for a wedding suddenly\r\nplaying with that gun, depicted in quick cuts showing her brandishing it in a\r\nvariety of ways, including, whoa!, putting it in her own mouth?), he builds up\r\nplenty of intrigue right away. At least one wants to figure out who these\r\ncharacters are, and how their stories are connected.  Advertisement Eventually who the characters are becomes clear, as does\r\ntheir lack of connection except by way of the concept so inelegantly put\r\nforward by the movie\u2019s title. The New York-based story finds a\r\nfundamentalist who\u2019s come in from Pakistan and is assigned by sleeper ops to\r\nkidnap a Muslim cleric who preaches an anti-extremist perspective. In India, a\r\nyoung woman forced into an arranged marriage pines for her lesbian lover, the\r\naforementioned nude artist, and takes radical action to be reunited with her, part\r\nof which includes turning the aforementioned gun on a male lover of the artist.\r\n These storylines are not just intercut with some showy\r\ncorrespondences (a New York highway becomes a Delhi road in the flick of an\r\nedit) but are interspersed with flashbacks, fantasy sequences, and more.\r\nDialogue is presented out of sync and used to push the visual action forward\r\nin time. Kumar has a very evident\r\ncommand of a lot of filmmaking techniques. He\u2019s clearly pretty passionate about\r\nthe stories he wants to tell. But as the film goes on, the stories become ever\r\nmore\u2026well, \u201cfar-fetched\u201d isn\u2019t a sufficient term to describe what they become.\r\nThe kidnapping plotline in particular takes twists and turns that are extremely\r\noverbaked, and once the extremist has got his battered victim back in a cozy\r\nbrownstone, and has got the cleric, his young wife, and their young son all\r\ntaped down to various household surface, the movie ventures into the realm of\r\npure grindhouse sadism. It\u2019s borderline reprehensible, in spite of Kumar\u2019s intentions.\r\nIlluminating the depradations of a self-styled jihadist is one thing; holding\r\nthe viewer by the back of the head and shoving his face into a welter of\r\nsimulated blood is another, and it\u2019s not a strategy that\u2019s likely to build a\r\nlot of viewer goodwill. Similarly, the sad end of the Delhi plotline is a\r\njailhouse scene in which a defied father gives tacit approval to something no\r\npatriarch should ever permit is not presented as explicitly, but still has an\r\nemphasis one can only describe as morbid. Do such outrages happen in real life?\r\nOf course they do, and they\u2019re awful, but their representation in this work is\r\nso willfully heavy handed that coherence of any kind\u2014artistic, dramatic,\r\nideological\u2014finds no bearing. As accomplished and committed as most of the cast\r\nis, one doesn\u2019t so much find affinity with the characters they play as feel bad\r\nthat they were compelled to enact such ugly movements."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Rush", "Review": "There comes a time in every critic's life when you find yourself going against the tide of opinion, set adrift by your inability to appreciate something everyone else is gaga for. It is a very different feeling than liking something everyone else despises. But as I gaze upon the 90% positive or so rating on Rotten Tomatoes, all I can do is take a deep breath and say, \"My name is Susan and I am a 'Rush' disliker.\" Not a hater, mind you. No movie featuring either one of those musclebound Aussie skyscrapers known as the Hemsworth brothers (this one has Chris, a.k.a. Thor, not Liam a.k.a Miley Cyrus' ex) can be all bad. I do admire a good car chase, whether in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d or in the original \u201cThe Fast and the Furious,\" and my double-digit viewings of \u201cSlap Shot\u201d and \u201cNorth Dallas Forty\u201d attest to my fascination with sports films\u2014but only if the off-field play between characters is as compelling as the contest on the field.\u00a0In the case of \"Rush\" it was immediately apparent that there was a slick formulaic surface clinging to this cinematic road trip. And for me, that was a turnoff.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Rush\" is\u00a0based on the true story of Formula One adversaries James Hunt, a swaggering rock-star-bad-boy Brit, and Niki Lauda, a tersely pragmatic Austrian with zero social skills and an itchy middle finger, as they vied for the 1976 world championship title.\u00a0If you know anything about these two not-quite-gentlemen, it's that one them will be sorely tested when tragedy strikes at speeds close to 200 mph.\u00a0Much praise already has been heaped upon director Ron Howard\u2014no stranger to car-themed movies as both a filmmaker (\"Grand Theft Auto\" )\u00a0and an actor (\"American Graffiti\")\u2014for striving to capture the visceral thrill of the sport. But I found \"Rush\" to suffer the same problem as most race-track movies, even if measures have been taken to give the audience a behind-the wheel point-of-view. As physically intense as racing might be, cinematically it's tough to portray as anything but repetitious. What's onscreen is a bunch of helmeted drivers in cramped vehicles chasing each other in circles with a few hairpin turns tossed in until the finish line looms\u2014and, unlike real life, the results have already been determined. I might have tolerated the film much more with the sound off. With the volume on, this movie feels like a mucho-macho Saturday morning cartoon\u2014specifically Bugs Bunny toying with his eternal pursuer, Elmer Fudd.\u00a0The action is fueled by a lot of pre-race trash talk, plenty of disparaging press-conference interviews and on-camera braggadocio, much plotting to maximize speed and outmaneuver the competition, tons of commentary during the actual races, followed by get-your-motor-running vroom-vroom on the track. (One of most overused pump-'em-up '60s hits ever, \"Gimme Some Lovin'\", is pressed into service once more.) Although this arena is far more glamorous and unrehearsed, I found Hunt and Lauda's pre-race confrontations as annoying as the over-the-top interplay that precedes pro wrestling matches\u2014and only half as clever as Bugs and Elmer's repartee. \"Rush\" is not so much a bromance as a foe-mance with rivals who are completed\u2014and in this case, literally driven to succeed\u2014by their polar opposites. While Hemsworth as Hunt and Daniel Br\u00fchl as Lauda are perfectly believable as their characters, I found it hard to root for either one\u2014although Br\u00fchl's charisma-impaired Lauda is closest to being a sympathetic Salieri-like underdog.\u00a0Howard and writer Peter Morgan eventually show how these bitter adversaries form a bond of mutual respect that can only be achieved when you both put your lives on the line to do what you love. But this moment arrives too late to break up a wearying pattern of bragging, bashing and crashing. Advertisement The film earns its \"R\" rating from Hunt's constant womanizing (his personal motto: \"Sex: Breakfast of Champions\") and scowling Lauda's propensity for using the F-word. Another contributing factor: the threat of violence lurking around every corner. The danger inherent in a sport that requires recklessness in order to win is flagged early and often, and Howard is not shy about showing the damage to flesh and metal. As Hunt says about his car, \"It's just a little coffin, really, surrounded by high-octane fuel all around\u2014for all intents and purposes, it's a bomb on wheels.\" \"Rush\" takes an especially wrong turn at the corner of love and marriage. Olivia Wilde certainly looks the part of runway siren Suzy Miller who inspired Hunt to wed on a whim, but adds little but eye candy. The fact that she soon runs off with actor Richard Burton is about as interesting as she gets. Faring worse is Alexandra Maria Lara as Lauda's first wife, Marlene Knaus, who mostly stands around silently and looks concerned, like one of the lesser nuns in \"The Sound of Music.\" How do you solve a problem like Niki? At least one scene did capture and hold my attention: when Knaus's car breaks down with Lauda driving and leaves the pair stranded on the quiet road in the Italian countryside, they each attempt to hitch a ride, and the outcome provides a clever twist on a similar scene performed by Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable in 1934's \"It Happened One Night.\" \n Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Every Day", "Review": "Maybe it all makes sense on the page. Maybe in David Levithan\u2019s Young Adult bestseller \u201cEvery Day,\u201d the premise is better explained, the twists and turns don\u2019t seem so outlandish, the melodramatic adolescent soliloquies resonate as they\u2019re intended. On the screen, though, \u201cEvery Day\u201d has an intriguing concept that\u2019s hampered by problematic execution. And it raises several questions it never answers in satisfying fashion, leading to a conclusion that will elicit not just head-scratching but unintentional hilarity. Advertisement But director Michael Sucsy\u2019s film does benefit greatly from the likability of its star, Angourie Rice, who was so magnetic a few years back as Ryan Gosling\u2019s wise-beyond-her-years daughter in \u201cThe Nice Guys.\u201d (Rice\u2019s naturalism, presence and even her voice are reminiscent of a young Amy Adams.) Here, she plays a much simpler type: a sweet, cute Maryland high school student named Rhiannon. She\u2019s decent and kind\u2014you want her to find happiness at the end of this wild romantic adventure. And she has to be the solid figure at the center as the cast of characters is constantly shifting around her, which is tougher than it looks. Because you see, Rhiannon has fallen in love with someone\u2014a soul, a spirit, something\u2014that changes bodies every day. He\u2014or is it she?\u2014goes by the initial 'A'. A wakes up every day inside a different teenager\u2014always around the same age, always around the same area\u2014and spends 24 hours there, sort of existing side-by-side with that person but mainly taking over without causing too many changes. The person wakes up the next day with only hazy memories of what he or she did the previous day. And then A is on to the next one. Why? Who knows. That\u2019s just the way it is. Rhiannon first meets A when A takes over the body of her boyfriend, the handsome but cocky Justin (Justice Smith). On ordinary days, Justin is definitely not deserving of someone as lovely as Rhiannon. But on this day, Justin is magical: attentive and inquisitive, doting and caring. Rhiannon falls in love all over again\u2014and it seems she\u2019s stirred something in A, too, to the extent that every day from then on, A seeks out Rhiannon to spend more time with her. It\u2019s the first significant emotional connection A has ever felt, prompting A to question whether there\u2019s a way to stop this whole body-hopping thing and settle down for good. Advertisement It sounds crazy\u2014like a speed-dating version of \u201cFreaky\u00a0Friday.\u201d But based on a screenplay by Jesse Andrews, who also wrote the novel and script for \u201cMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,\u201d it sorta works for a while. The mystery of who A will be each day, and how he/she will find Rhiannon and explain to her what\u2019s really going on here, gives the film some forward momentum. Among the memorable suitors are a mild-mannered, heavyset kid named James (Jacob Batalon, Peter Parker\u2019s scene-stealing best friend in last year\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d); a trans student named Vic (Ian Alexander); a black homeschooler named George (Sean Jones) who sneaks out to meet Rhiannon at a library; and a troubled Asian girl named Kelsea (Nicole Law), who challenges A\u2019s long-held notions about staying out of the personal lives of the people he inhabits. Beneath the narrative gimmick, there is a worthwhile, fundamental message about the importance of getting to know people for who they truly are inside, regardless of the expectations you might have about them based on their appearance, race, gender or sexual orientation. It\u2019s a nice idea within nutty packaging. Sucsy\u2019s previous feature was the similarly twisty and ambitious \u201cThe Vow\u201d from 2012, in which Rachel McAdams comes out of a coma after a car accident with no memory of her life\u2014including the fact that she\u2019s married to Channing Tatum, who must fight to win her back. (I think I\u2019d remember being married to Channing Tatum, but that\u2019s just me.) \u201cEvery Day\u201d has a similar guilelessness about its insanely romantic premise. Either you\u2019re going to go with it, or you\u2019re not. But even if you have gone with it, you may have trouble (as I did) with the off-the-rails climax. It begins with a flash-forward to what life might be like if A stayed in the body of one of Rhiannon\u2019s final suitors, a sensitive classmate named Alexander (Owen Teague), accompanied by a tortured monologue. But the film\u2019s ultimate, final moments, which are meant to be momentous, are more likely to result in a missing persons case."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "X Games 3D: The Movie", "Review": "Well, it's awesome all right, what these X Games stars achieve. It's also awesome how little there is to be said about it. If you're a fan of extreme skateboarding, motorcycling and motocross, this is the movie for you. If not, not. And even if you are, what's in the film other than what you might have seen on TV? Yes, it's in 3D, which adds nothing and dims the picture. \tAlthough \"X Games 3D: The Movie\" is billed as a documentary, let me mention two things that struck me as peculiar. During the final Mega Ramp extreme skateboarding competition in the Staples Center in LA, we learn almost accidentally that this is a sport that is scored on a point system, like diving or gymnastics. This is referred to only indirectly by the narrator, Emile Hirsch, who lavishes time on such inanities as \"he treats gravity like some people do evolution, as only a theory,\" and \"the present is past; only the future has currency.\" The flaw in this time theory is that when the future becomes the present it is the past. And gravity is more than a theory when you fall 50 feet onto a hard surface, as one X gamer does. Advertisement \tWe start to notice the competitors glancing up at what must be a scoreboard, but we're never shown it, nor informed of anybody's score. Why not? The film also has an annoying way of frequently not showing the beginning, middle and end of a shot in one unbroken take. What's the point? During a two-car motocross \"race,\" it's peculiar that the two cars are only seen together in one brief shot, as one flies off a dirt ramp and over the other, crossing below. Are they on different tracks? The narrator doesn't ever say. \tWhat the athletes do is dangerous and risky. For example, hurtling down an almost perpendicular incline on a skate board, using your speed to climb another terrifying ramp, and then launching into mid-air to perform \"360s\" and even \"520s\" before landing again on another ramp. Or, flying straight up from a ramp, doing a flip and/or a rotation, and landing again on the same ramp. \tOn motorcycles, they fly off earth ramps, twist in the air, and land on another ramp. Or they do a high jump -- flying almost straight in the air to clear a bar at 32 or 33 feet. Often they fail, fall hard, and there's a tense silence while medics rush to the rescue. One competitor, Danny Way, apparently breaks something at Staples and returns to jump two more times. Earlier, he breaks his ankle in a practice jump and returns the next day to attempt to go over the great Wall of China on a skateboard. \tAthletes are asked why they take such risks and play with such pains (all of them have had broken bones and concussions). Their answers are the usual sports clich\u00e9s about challenges and \"taking the sport to a new level.\" Their cars and clothing are plastered with commercial endorsements, and at the X Games there are big ads for Pizza Hut, the Navy, and so on. I guess they get paid. A lot, I hope. \t\"Who wants an A in history when you can get an X,\" we're asked. Here's my theory about time. Yesterday is history, tomorrow's a mystery -- so why get killed today? Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "A Good Marriage", "Review": "What is it about Stephen King\u2019s novels and short stories\r\nthat so often make their transition to the screen rocky, to say the least? Even\r\nwhen he adapts, as he does with \u201cA Good Marriage,\u201d starring Joan Allen and\r\nAnthony LaPaglia, the resulting product regularly fails to capture the breadth\r\nof his gifts as a storyteller. Perhaps it\u2019s because so many of King\u2019s best\r\nnarratives involve something easier to relate to in the form of the written\r\nword than recreated on film: the horror behind the picket fence. Little is\r\nscarier than the realization that your husband (\u201cThe Shining\u201d), rescuer (\u201cMisery\u201d),\r\ncar (\u201cChristine\u201d) or even family pet (\u201cCujo\u201d) are not what they seem. And yet\r\nthat same identifiable horror in his fiction often falls flat in film. Flat is\r\nthe kindest way to describe \u201cA Good Marriage,\u201d a King novella turned feature\r\nthat could have worked as a short or an episode of \u201cMasters of Horror\u201d but\r\ntruly tests viewer patience at 102 minutes. It\u2019s arguably the dullest King film\r\nyet, despite solid work by LaPaglia to save it and a decent set-up that goes\r\nabsolutely nowhere. Advertisement I remember seeing George Sluizer\u2019s \u201cThe Vanishing\u201d at a\r\nyoung enough age to be disturbed not just by its legendary ending but by the\r\nvery concept that a madman could also be a family man. Wait, not all serial\r\nkillers are drooling maniacs? I might be living next door to one? And he might\r\nhave a wife? And kids?!?!?! How is that possible? King reportedly was inspired\r\nby the fact that The BTK Killer had a wife, who dealt with a lot of negative\r\npress when his binding/torturing/killing came to light. How could she not have\r\nknown? He reimagines BTK as \u201cBeadie,\u201d a man who has killed a dozen\r\nyoung women in Maine. After Bob (LaPaglia) goes out of town on another\r\ncollectible coin-hunting mission tied in with work, longtime wife Darcy (Allen)\r\nhappens upon a BDSM magazine in the garage. She digs a little deeper, and she\r\nfinds a box with driver\u2019s licenses of the dead girls. She starts putting it\r\ntogether. Bob is Beadie. What will she do? Will she confront him? How will she\r\nprotect her three kids from the pain sure to come? \u201cA Good Marriage,\u201d at its best, should be a war of wills\r\nbetween a maniac and the wife who just learned she has loved a maniac. And yet this\r\nwar is surprisingly, even shockingly dull. It's filmed like a TV movie, with the central setting of Bob & Darcy's house feeling bizarrely like a set. Nothing in this world is lived in. There are no stakes. There's no reason to care.  Part of the problem is both in the\r\nway Darcy is crafted in the screenplay and the choices made by Allen in\r\npresenting her. This Darcy is cold, and almost callous at times. I simply never\r\nbelieved her dilemma. And if that\u2019s true, all of \u201cA Good Marriage\u201d falls apart.\r\nLaPaglia does better work, almost finding a dark current of Coen-esque black\r\ncomedy in the coin-collecting lunatic. And that right there is a big problem\u2014when\r\nyou find the BTK Killer more interesting than the wife who you need to root for\r\nin her efforts to stop him.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Romance of Astrea and Celadon", "Review": "The French New Wave began circa 1958 and influenced in one way or another most of the good movies made ever since. Some of its pioneers (Melville, Truffaut, Malle) are dead, but the others (Godard, Chabrol, Rivette, Resnais, Varda) are still active in their late 70s and up. And Eric Rohmer, at 88, has only just announced that \"The Romance of Astrea and Celadon\" may be his last film. It doesn't look like typical Rohmer. He frequently gives us contemporary characters, besotted not so much by love as by talking about it, finding themselves involved in ethical and plot puzzles, at the end of which he likes to quote a proverb or moral. His films are quietly passionate and lightly mannered. Advertisement But then, so is \"Astrea and Celadon,\" even if it's set in 5th century Gaul and involves shepherds, shepherdesses, druids and nymphs. The story was told in a novel by Honore d'Urfe, Marquis of Valromey and Count of Chateauneuf, who published it in volumes between 1607 and 1627 -- running, I learn, some 5,000 pages. The film version must therefore be considerably abridged at 109 minutes, although it leaves you wondering if the novel ran on like this forever. The movie does rather run on, although it is charming and sweet, and is perhaps too languid. It is about two lovers obsessed with love's codes of honor. That is, curiously, the same subject as Rivette's 2007 film, \"The Duchess of Langeais,\" made when he was 84. The characters seem perversely more dedicated to debating the fine points than getting down to it. Rivette has them talking to each other; Rohmer has them fretting while separated. The story is told in pastoral woodlands and pastures, and along a river's banks. We meet the handsome Celadon (Andy Gillet) and the beautiful Astrea (Stephanie Crayencour), shepherds and in love, not long before a tragic misperception breaks Astrea's heart, and Celadon hurls himself into the river in remorse. Believed by Astrea to be dead, he is fished out by the statuesque nymph Galathee (Veronique Reymond) and her handmaidens, and kept all but captive in her castle. He pines, sworn never to be seen by Astrea's eyes again, while the two lovers debate the loopholes in romantic love with their friends. They also debate such matters as whether the Trinity corresponds to the Roman gods, and sing, quote poetry and mostly seem to ignore sheep. A Druid priest convinces Celadon to disguise himself as a girl and infiltrate Astrea's inner circle, creating much suspense, mostly on my part, as I kept expecting Astrea to exclaim, \"Celadon, do you actually think you can fool anyone with that disguise?\" But they play by the rules, and then things pick up nicely when they break them. This would not be the Rohmer film you would want to start with. I've seen most of his films, and my first was \"My Night at Maud's\" (1969), about a long conversation about everything but love -- which is to say, about love. Rohmer, I think, delights in these dialogue passages, as they allow him to see his characters more carefully than in your usual formula, where courtships seem to be conducted via hormonal aromas. Sometimes his approach is sexier. The knee in \"Claire's Knee\" fascinated me more than entire bodies in countless films. Why Rohmer decided to end with this film, I cannot say.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Rush Hour 3", "Review": "I like this movie about as much as it's possible to like a movie with a two-star rating. Given its materials, it couldn't have been much better, but it's every bit as good as it is, if you see what I mean. Once you realize it's only going to be so good, you settle back and enjoy that modest degree of goodness, which is at least not badness, and besides, if you're watching \"Rush Hour 3,\" you obviously didn't have anything better to do, anyway. The filmmakers didn't, either, I guess. It has been six years since \"Rush Hour 2,\" and unless you believe that director Brett Ratner and his stars, Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, spent all that time turning down offers for a sequel, it seems fairly likely that this is a case of returning once more with a bucket before the well runs dry. Tucker is again Carter, the motormouth LAPD cop who's always in trouble, and Chan is again Lee, the ace Hong Kong cop called in to partner with him. This is, you realize, a formula. A friend of mine (I think it is me) calls these Wunza Movies. You know, wunza L.A. cop and wunza cop from China, and neither wunza guy you want to mess with. Advertisement Curious how Carter is always being hauled in from a punishment gig like traffic detail and being assigned to super-important cases that will require him to investigate backstage at the Folies Bergere in Paris, etc. This time, one of Lee's old pals, Ambassador Han, has been shot in an assassination attempt in L.A., probably by a Chinese Triad gang, who are getting to be as handy as the Mafia for movie plots. Lee, in town as the ambassador's bodyguard, runs after the shooter in one of those impossible Jackie Chan chase scenes; it used to be we were amazed by his stunts, but these days I find myself even more amazed that he can still run that far. Lee partners with his old friend Carter, and they go to the hospital to question the ambassador's beautiful daughter Soo Yung (Zhang Jingchu). This produces the movie's funniest line, by Carter: \"Let's go to the gift shop and get a little teddy bear.\" Soo Yung had possession of an envelope with key evidence her father was going to use in testimony before the World Court. The envelope is, of course, this movie's MacGuffin, and was stolen from Soo Yung at her karate academy. The cops go there and have a battle with the world's tallest man (Sun Ming Ming). I think he's the same man who got married recently and was about twice as tall as his bride. Or maybe he's another tall guy -- naw, it has to be the same guy. Yao Ming, the basketball player, is only 7 feet, 6 inches, and Sun Ming Ming is 7 feet, 9 inches. A guy that tall, on his wedding night he could be making love and solving a Rubik's Cube at the same time. When Jackie Chan engages him in kung fu, he has to call on some of his wall-climbing skills. Anyway, the chase leads to Paris, where the fragrant Genevieve (Noemie Lenoir) appears. Her function in the film, apart from certain plot details is -- to appear, which she does to great effect. And soon Carter is backstage at the Folies Bergere, and all the time we know, just know, that the Eiffel Tower is in the background of so many shots for a reason. Yes, there is a pursuit up and down the tower, with Jackie Chan doing the usual impossible things, although at 53, he doesn't do all of his own stunts. What difference does it make? In these days of special effects, who can tell, anyway? For years, I suspected that the only reason Jackie did the stunts himself was to provide footage for the shots during the closing credits, showing him waving cheerfully as he was taken to the hospital. All of these events take place efficiently, and I was amused, even by a dialogue sequence involving a \"Mr. Yu\" and a \"Mr. Mee,\" in which \"he's Mee and I'm Yu,\" and who's on first? If you are trapped in a rainstorm in front of a theater playing this picture, by all means go right in. You won't have a bad time, will feel affectionate toward Lee and Carter, and stay dry.

{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Me Him Her", "Review": "Max Landis has made a career of writing genre movies that must have had some good pitches\u2014in less than five years, five of his scripts have been made into features. It's very curious watching \"Me Him Her,\" then, as to why he would pick probably his worst produced screenplay, a rough draft in nearly every sense, for a directorial debut. For a studio-trained writer, it turns out to be an amateur rebellion against form.\u00a0 Brandon Ehrlick (Luke Bracey) is the big Hollywood star of TV series \"Hard Justice,\" who is afraid of coming out of the closet. Somewhere else in the City of Angels, Gabbi (Emily Meade) is having trouble breaking up with her cheating ex-girlfriend. It's the third person to this equation who sets them both off on paths of discovery, Dustin Milligan's tacky, altruistic Cory, who might have wayward ways of helping people, but he will be right in the end. Advertisement Within the first 15 minutes, Cory tries to help Brandon in accepting himself by dragging him to a gay bar, an effort he ditches when he meets the dejected Gabbi, while Brandon is then hounded by paparazzi. Cory and Gabbi hit it off, and as happens in stories told with straight male gaze, they sleep together. A barely-there storyline then drags to 95 minutes as we barely get to know these people outside of their sexual preferences, or whether their faces are on billboards or not. The performances lend themselves to the superficiality of these characters, with an exception of Meade, who stands out for providing some full-force meltdowns, an unfortunate and redundant expression in Landis' cinematic world. As it works to have Milligan's tacky lead fix these people for themselves, \"Me Him Her\" sets itself inside Landis' hate-hate relationship with Los Angeles. He indifferently uses overhead shots of the Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood sign for visual familiarity, but not character. A satire of sorts about the smug that's in the air of Hollywood, Landis' weak jabs about LA and its inhabitants lack the cleverness for their sarcasm to engage. Hollywood agents are superficial, Los Angeles is unpredictable, and Haley Joel Osment (playing himself) is a huge star again.\u00a0 Instead of settling for an unfunny comedy about friends and lovers in LA, Landis has to get political with material the script has no authority for. With the naive Corey at the center influencing everyone's lives, \"Me Him Her\" wields a straight man\u2019s privilege. Cory can help force a gay man out of the closet, not because his friends and family already know Brandon is gay (to Brandon\u2019s constant surprise), but because it's not Cory's career or life to deal with, despite Landis' establishment of a homophobic Hollywood. In the same way that \"Me Him Her\" bungles its initially refreshing friendship between straight and gay men, the film's romance is even more teeth-gnashing. With Gabby always dressed in flannel (\"a lesbian's Power Ranger costume,\" the script jokes) and her saying that men never want to be just her friend, the problematic character only makes it worse when Cory woos her with his heterosexuality. \"Me Him Her\" unwittingly resists an audience, its heart not invisible just profoundly out of touch.\u00a0 Advertisement In \"Me Him Her,\" both Brandon and Gabby have brief nightmares about being tormented by a giant puppet penis, to give you a sense of the film's humor and means of expressing it. Brandon's line earlier in the film that \"the line between dreams and reality is thinner here\" becomes a copout for Landis' jokes, which cranks up wackiness (a climactic sword fight during a cop drama's premiere party) or its confrontations, such as the pithy screwball between Cory and Gabby as he chases her across Beverly Hills, only to have them scream in public about their very private encounter. Like the stylized subtitles it sporadically throws onto the screen to put pepper on throwaway lines, \"Me Him Her\" often lurches with a cartoonish impulse to keep itself amused, providing a false feeling of narrative momentum in the process. Only a fool would define the term \"hipster,\" but such a category\u2019s elements would describe Landis' filmmaking: entitled angst, sarcastic tone, self-declared enlightenment, and, of course, irony ad infinitum. \"Me Him Her\" might look cool on the outside, but it's a vapid mess."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Epic", "Review": "The most imaginative section of \"Epic\" starts with shots of the forest that rings the home of Professor Bomba (voiced by Jason Sudeikis), the inventor dad of the film's heroine, Mary Katherine (Amanda Seyfried). Some leaves and branches are in crisp focus. Others are out-of-focus. The images are so entrancing on their own terms that it takes a while to register the creatures in the out-of-focus parts of the shot, disguising themselves against foliage and bark. Then comes a very long, unbroken shot that prowls across a collage of significant objects: the professor's journals and equations, blueprints and sketches, research photos and files. These clerical objects look both \"real\" and illustrated; you can see dirt, dust, fingerprints. The imagery may remind film buffs of the opening credits of \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" which probed the contents of a box that Scout left for Boo Radley. Advertisement Before you get\u00a0 excited about \"Epic,\" \u00a0I should warn you that this sequence isn't representative of the film \u2014 not at all. What I've just described are the movie's end credits. They're afterthoughts, designed to keep older children amused while parents help little ones don their shoes and backpacks before tromping our for pizza.  But they offer hints of what \"Epic\" could have been, were it not such a slave to clich\u00e9s of modern American cartoon-making.  The latest from Blue Sky Studio (\"Ice Age,\" \"Rio\") is different from whatever Pixar, Disney or any other big animation outfit happens to be offering this year, but not so different that you should kick yourself for skipping it. There's a protagonist grieving over her mother's recent death, and a brilliant but scatterbrained father who loves his child but isn't the strong parental figure she desperately needs. There's a hidden world akin to Alice's Wonderland that the inquisitive heroine explores. There are beleaguered good guys that she joins in a war against bad guys that represent chaos and decay; their leader is a funny despot with a European accent. There's a mythology that will be fulfilled when good guys take a fragile pod on a journey toward a prophesied end. There's a young warrior with whom the heroine forms a flirtatious friendship. There's a tough older warrior who mentors the younger warrior. There are comic sidekicks, and a beautiful forest queen who utters platitudes about the cycles of life and then dies.  The good guys are the Leafmen, tiny forest sprites that look like humans. The bad guys are the Boggans, who look like storybook drawings of goblins or trolls. The sidekicks are two snails that worship the Leafmen and desperately want to be like them, but can't be, because they're snails. Josh Hutcherson of \"The Hunger Games\" provides the voice of the young warrior, Nod, who's physically gifted but immature; like Seyfried's Mary Katherine, he speaks with the circa-2013 colloquialisms and inflections of pretty much any teenager you'd run into at any mall anywhere in America. There's nothing special about him, or Mary Katherine, or Ronin, the older warrior voiced by Colin Farrell, or Mandrake, the funny-vicious bad guy voiced by Christoph Waltz, or Mug and Grub, the sidekick slugs voiced by Aziz Ansari and Chris O'Dowd. There's nothing special about Queen Tara, who's voiced by singer-actress Beyonce Knowles, or about Knowles' post-credits song, which will get an Oscar nomination anyway because the original song pickings are always slim.  The compositions are attractive but not striking, the action sequences engaging but rarely thrilling. Danny Elfman's score sounds like the kind of score you'd expect an animated forest adventure to have; I can't imagine anyone claiming that he phoned it in, just as I can't imagine anyone claiming that the director Chris Wedge (\"Ice Age,\" \"Robots\") phoned it his direction, or that the screenwriters phoned in their writing \u2014 though the fact that there are five credited writers suggests that what we see onscreen wasn't much like the first draft, or the second, or the ninth. Wedge appeared to confirm this in a 2012 interview with USA Today, in which he described the source, William Joyce's \"The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs,\" as \"a wonderful book\" but \"a quaint story... We wanted to make a gigantic action-adventure movie.\" Fair enough. Who doesn't love a gigantic action-adventure movie, especially one that's animated?  Advertisement The problem isn't that the vision changed in the transition from book to screen \u2014 that's true of most adaptations \u2014 but that it changed in ways that made the end product unremarkable. Look at the cover of the book, then look at any second from the film that it supposedly inspired; where the former is obviously the work of a singular consciousness, its cinematic spin-off has as much personality as a minivan. Films like \"Epic\" aren't so much created as manufactured, then released into multiplexes, where they're viewed by children and parents who treat them as two hours' worth of air conditioning with popcorn. The movie's marvelous trailer hinted at melancholy splendors, and an excess of beauty and feeling, but when you're actually sitting there watching the darned thing, it's \"Ferngully\" all over again. The ratio of humor and action and parent-child bonding is so formulaic, and the character design and molded-figurine-like animation so typical of the genre in the age of Pixar (and Pixar imitators), that \"Epic\" evaporates from the mind within minutes of leaving the theater.  The only reason this isn't a one-star review is that it would not be fair to blame \"Epic\" for failures of imagination that seem systemic. The movie is one more example of post-\"Toy Story\" bet-hedging by studios that want cartoon features to be different enough from other cartoon features to justify their existence, but not so different that they can't be used to sell Happy Meals and T-shirts and video games \u2014 and certainly not so original that audiences might have to come to terms with the shock of the new. While watching \"Epic\", it's hard to picture filmmakers as defiantly unique as Hayao Miyazaki (\"Spirited Away,\" \"Ponyo\") or Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol (\"A Cat in Paris\") or Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Parronaud (\"Persepolis\") thriving under American studio parameters. It's equally hard to guess how directors as original as Brad Bird (\"The Iron Giant,\" \"The Incredibles\") or Shane Acker (2009's \"Nine\") or Henry Selick (\"Coraline\") produced work of\u00a0 passion, integrity and surprise, and got them seen by mainstream audiences.  The most startling and delightful animation in American studio pictures tends to happen in a film's margins \u2014 in brief digressions from the main story (see the dream interludes in \"Kung Fu Panda 2\", which seemed to have been drawn in oil pastel) or in post-credits sequences that often feel as intimate as a tour of an artist's workspace. The end credits of \"Epic\" are so personal and lovely that I could have watched them for two hours. I wish I had."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Short Term 12", "Review": "It all could have been painfully mawkish, populated as it is with the kinds of kids who provide inspiration for after-school specials. Instead, \"Short Term 12\" comes from a place of delicate and truthful understatement, which allows the humanity and decency of its characters\u2014and, yes, the lessons\u2014to shine through naturally. The film's originality begins with the setting: a foster-care center for at-risk teens whose troubles run the gamut from depression to substance abuse to self-mutilation. Writer-director Destin Daniel Cretton based \"Short Term 12\" partly on his own experiences working at such a center, and previously made a short film on the subject. In drawing the story out to feature length, Cretton takes an abidingly naturalistic, conversational approach to both the complicated issues these kids face and the no-nonsense way their counselors try to help them. Advertisement Chief among them is Brie Larson as the twentysomething Grace, a formerly troubled teen herself who now hopes to serve as a guide for others. Just as the extent of Grace's painful past is revealed to us in deliberate pieces, Larson's performance itself is a revelation. It's a welcome and long-overdue lead role for the actress who's been so engaging in supporting parts in films like \"The Spectacular Now\" and \"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\" and the Showtime series \"The United States of Tara.\" There's a directness about her that's appealing, even here where she's meant to look a little mousy and low-key. At the film's start, Grace seems to have achieved a comfortable balance between her professional and personal lives. She handles both the mundane routine of the place and the volatile emotional flare-ups with the same sort of cool confidence. She also has a loving, playful relationship with her longtime live-in boyfriend, the shaggy, foulmouthed Mason (played amiably by John Gallagher Jr.), who works alongside her as a supervisor at the center.  But the impending departure of one kid and the arrival of another shake everything up for her. Tough, intense Marcus (Keith Stanfield) is about to turn 18, which means he'll have to leave the home; frightened to make his way on his own, he acts out during these final days instead of facing his future. A profane and deeply felt rap song he wrote details his life of neglect and abuse, and the fact that Cretton presents the performance in one long take adds to its power.  Marcus overlaps briefly with the surly and withdrawn new girl, Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), who insists her father is coming to get her soon so she refuses to make friends. One of the subtle beauties of \"Short Term 12\" is the way it intimately depicts how the counselors find ways into these kids' lives and connect with them. For Grace and Jayden, it's through a shared love of drawing. But Jayden also uses her art to reveal the truth about her home life, which stirs secrets within Grace that she'd fought hard for years to suppress. Advertisement This upheaval comes at a time when Grace and Mason are trying to create something lasting for themselves: a home and a family of their own. The ambivalence Grace finds herself feeling, and the way that emotional shift shatters Mason, are both believable and heartbreaking.  Cretton shows as much care and kindness with the minutiae of the daily routine\u2014the doling out of meds, searches for contraband and forced recreational activities like Wiffle ball games\u2014as he does with the larger issues that plague these lives in flux. He  also infuses his story with unexpected humor as the kids hassle each  other\u2014and their supervisors\u2014on the road to healing.   While some of the third-act choices his characters make seem a little extreme compared to the realism that marks the rest of the film, Cretton consistently refrains from employing a tone that's heavy-handed. \"Short Term 12\" is a small gem in which the uplift feels earned rather than preached."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Journey to the West", "Review": "By turns daffy and dazzling, awkward and artful, \"Journey to the West\" takes an ancient tale and gives it contemporary flair. In adapting one of the Four Great Classical Novels of 16th-century Chinese literature, co-directors Stephen Chow and Derek Kwok have crafted a rollicking fantasy\u2014a crazy fable that ultimately reaffirms the power of faith. Their giant martial-arts set pieces are nothing short of extraordinary; lively and lovely, they're filled with both great intricacy and innovation.  These scenes, which can be both wildly slapsticky and minutely graceful, provide the film with a winning, driving energy. And then when they're over, the characters unfortunately have to talk.  Advertisement \"Journey to the West\" follows a goofy but sincere Buddhist monk named Xuan Zang (Zhang Wen), a young demon hunter who must vanquish a series of foes en route to his ultimate showdown with the notorious, shape-shifting Monkey King (Bo Huang). When we first see him, in the film's lengthy, tour-de-force opening sequence, he's helping a bunch of frightened villagers take down a giant, hungry fish that's leaping from the water and wreaking havoc. The comedy has a Mel Brooks-like sensibility about it that's appealing; it's playful in a deadly-serious situation. (Chow also directed the pleasingly cartoonish \"Shaolin Soccer\" and \"Kung Fu Hustle.\") But the choreography is undeniable: a breathtaking series of near misses and tricky balancing acts.  Xuan's preferred, absurd method of attack, per his mentor, is to tame the beasts by singing lullabies to them from a book called \"300 Nursery Rhymes.\" The sweetness and innocence within Zhang's performance feels very Keanu Reeves circa \"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,\" complete with a mop of wild hair. This is actually a compliment. The rival demon hunter he keeps running into, a catlike creature known as Miss Duan (Qi Shu), favors a more direct strategy: She takes them on through balletic physical battles with the help of a magical golden bracelet\u2014\"The Infinite Flying Ring\"\u2014which she can duplicate countless times. As she flings the circles through the air like lethal boomerangs, her targets explode in a burst of dust. It's an awesome sight to behold.  But then \"Journey to the West\" has an episodic structure that saps it of much of the momentum it gains during those thrilling set pieces. Xuan and Duan have one adventure, then another, than another. They meet one eccentric character, then another, then another. There's a tiger demon and a pig demon. There's a preening royal known as Prince Important (clearly a friend of President Business from \"The Lego Movie\") and an elderly man known as the Almighty Foot, whose shriveled limb expands to an enormous size when the time comes for him to stomp on his enemies. (He might have the best catch phrase ever: \"Today, you will die by my almighty foot!\")  Advertisement Along the way, Xuan and Duan trade some stilted and truly cringe-worthy dialogue\u2014initially about their conflicting strategies, eventually about the half-hearted romance that develops between them. Out of nowhere, Duan finds herself falling hard for her unlikely companion and throwing herself at him in increasingly elaborate ways.  Maybe it's written that way on the page, but on the screen\u2014especially in a film that benefits from such a strong and fearless female\u2014the sudden need to have a man define her is a disheartening clich\u00e9. Also, some of the interactions between the male characters carry more than a whiff of homophobia which seems archaic. Again, maybe that's from the source material. But a film that clearly went out of its way to appeal to modern audiences perhaps could have gone just a tiny bit further."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "The Great Debaters", "Review": "\"The Great Debaters\" is about an underdog debate team that wins a national championship, and some critics have complained that it follows the formula of all sports movies by leading up, through great adversity, to a victory at the end. So it does. How many sports movies, or movies about underdogs competing in any way, have you seen that end in defeat? It is human nature to seek inspiration in victory, and this is a film that is affirming and inspiring and re-creates the stories of a remarkable team and its coach. Advertisement The team is from little Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, a black institution in the Jim Crow South of the 1930s. The school's English professor, Melvin Tolson (Denzel Washington), is a taskmaster who demands the highest standards from his debate team, and they're rewarded with a national championship. That's what the \"sports movie\" is about, but the movie is about so much more, and in ways that do not follow formulas. There are, for example, Tolson's secret lives. Wearing overalls and work boots, he ventures out incognito as an organizer for a national sharecropper's union. He's a dangerous radical, local whites believe: probably a communist. But he's organizing both poor whites and blacks, whose servitude is equal. He keeps his politics out of the classroom, however, where he conceals a different kind of secret: He is one of America's leading poets. Although the movie barely touches on it, Tolson published long poems in such magazines as the Atlantic Monthly and in 1947 was actually named poet laureate of Liberia. Ironic, that his role as a debate coach would win him greater fame today. He holds grueling auditions and selects four team members: Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), who drinks and fools around but is formidably intelligent; Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams), a superb debater; James Farmer Jr. (Forest Whitaker), a precocious 14-year-old who is their researcher, and Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), the substitute, and the only female debater they've heard of. Tolson drills them, disciplines them, counsels them and leads them to a string of victories that culminates a victory over Harvard, the national champion. We get a good sense of the nurturing black community that has produced these students, in particular James Farmer Sr. (Forest Whitaker), a preacher. (Young Denzel Whitaker, as his son, is no relation, and not named after Washington). James Jr. would go on to found the Congress of Racial Equality. Tolson drives his team on long road trips to out-of-town debates, and one night traveling late, they have the defining emotional experience of the film: They happen upon a scene where a white mob has just lynched a black man and set his body afire. They barely escape with their own lives. And daily life for them is fraught with racist peril; especially for Tolson, who has been singled out by the local sheriff as a rabble-rouser. These experiences inform their debates as much as formal research. Advertisement The movie is not really about how this team defeats the national champions. It is more about how its members, its coach, its school and community believe that an education is their best way out of the morass of racism and discrimination. They would find it unthinkable that decades in the future, serious black students would be criticized by jealous contemporaries for \"acting white.\" They are black, proud, single-minded, focused, and they express all this most dramatically in their debating. The debates themselves have one peculiarity: The Wiley team somehow draws the \"good\" side of every question. Since debaters are supposed to defend whatever position they draw, it might have been intriguing to see them defend something they disbelieve, even despise. Still, I suppose I understand why that isn't done here; it would have interrupted the flow. And the flow becomes a mighty flood in a powerful and impassioned story. This is one of the year's best films. NOTE: In fact, the real Wiley team did beat the national champions, but from USC, not Harvard. Co-writer Robert Eisele explains, \"In that era, there was much at stake when a black college debated any white school, particularly one with the stature of Harvard. We used Harvard to demonstrate the heights they achieved.\""}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Searching for Sugar Man", "Review": "A documentary featuring Stephen Segerman, Dennis Coffey, Mike Theodore, Dan Dimaggio, Jerome Ferretti, Steve Rowland, Willem Moller, Craig Bartholomew-Strydom, Ilse Assmann, Steve M. Harris, Robbie Mann, Clarence Avant, Eva Rodriguez, Sixto Rodriguez, Regan Rodriguez, Sandra Rodriguez-Kennedy, Rick Emmerson, Rian Malan. Do some stories exist only because we need them to? \"Searching for Sugar Man\" is about a gifted singer-songwriter from Detroit who was an enigma. His face half-hidden by long flowing hair and dark glasses, he sang in folk music bars with his back turned to the audience. His name was Sixto Rodriguez.  Advertisement He was so good that without fame or a large fan base, he signed a two-album contract with Sussex and A&R Records. The first album, \"Cold Fact,\" got a rare four-star review from Billboard. Neither it nor the second one, \"Coming From Reality,\" sold well, the contract was dropped, and the story seemed to end there. Nothing else was heard from Sixto Rodriguez. But several years later, his albums traveled half the world away, to Cape Town, South Africa, where bootleg copies passed from hand to hand and his songs became anthems of the anti-apartheid movement. When an indie record store owner named Stephen Segerman released them commercially, they took off, the first selling 500,000 copies, which in that nation would be comparable to the Beatles or Elvis Presley.  This documentary by Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul moves between Detroit and Cape Town, speaking to such influential South Africans as Rian Malan about the impact Rodriguez had at the time. But what about the singer himself? Nothing was known. Rumors spread that he was dead \u2014 a suicide, who killed himself onstage by shooting himself or setting himself afire. Absolutely no evidence existed to support such theories, which by their sensational nature would hardly have passed unnoticed. In the absence of information the mystery only grew, about a man who was known only by his music, and even whose face was hardly clear. The rise of the Internet made it easier for Segerman to search for his best-selling star (whose royalties went to A&M Records). Segerman himself began to be called \"Sugarman,\" after the title of one of Rodriguez's songs. In the film, he emerges as one of those figures independent music depends upon \u2014 always there in his store, supporting and listening to music he believes in, spreading the gospel. In the case of Rodriguez, the gospel had already spread through South Africa on its own, propelled by the power of the songs. Advertisement There was no mention of Rodriguez on the net. Segerman posted a Web page about his search. In the late 1990s he received a comment on that page \u2014 no, not from Rodriguez but from someone who had information. If there is any chance you know nothing about this film, I am not going to reveal its ending. Let me just say it is miraculous and inspiring. \"Searching for Sugar Man\" is a documentary that enlists us in the process of its search. Using archival footage, it shows both Segerman and Bendjelloul pressing ahead in a quest that became increasingly frustrating. The information they eventually dislodge about Rodriguez suggests a secular saint, a deeply good man, whose music is the expression of a blessed inner being. I hope you're able to see this film. You deserve to. And yes, it exists because we need for it to."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Jim: The James Foley Story", "Review": "We all know the image. It\u2019s when many of us first heard the\r\nacronym ISIS. It\u2019s a still of a man in an orange jumpsuit with his executioner\r\nstanding behind him in the desert. The man is James Foley, a conflict\r\njournalist who was kidnapped in Syria and beheaded in 2014, the video of that\r\nhorrible act travelling the world as a pronouncement of a new international\r\nthreat. Brian Oakes\u2019 \u201cJim: The James\r\nFoley Story,\u201d an Audience Award winner at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival,\r\npremiering on HBO this Saturday, February 6th, reclaims that image.\r\nIt turns it into more than a tool of terrorism, fully capturing the life of a\r\nman who knew he was at risk every time he went out on a job. Directed by an old\r\nfamily friend, \u201cJim\u201d is a moving portrait of courage, but it is most of all a\r\nconcerted effort to take back the life of James Foley. Advertisement Oakes accomplishes this by speaking to three distinct groups\r\nof people\u2014Jim\u2019s family, Jim\u2019s colleagues and Jim\u2019s fellow prisoners. Jim\u2019s\r\nfamily, who often refer to the director by his first name indicating their high\r\ncomfort level with him, still struggle to understand him. Why would he continue\r\nto put his life at risk covering stories in war-torn areas? As stories of\r\nkidnapped journalists and embedded reporters being killed continue to\r\nproliferate, his family tries to relate to a man who always felt like he needed\r\nto be doing something. He would come home, but be restless enough that he had\r\nto go back out again. His brothers, father and mother do a phenomenal job of\r\ncoloring in the emotional details of Jim\u2019s life, letting us get to know him in\r\nthe way only a family can. It\u2019s remarkable how open and honest they are about\r\ntheir loss. But a family only knows so much about you, and Oakes\u2019\r\ndocumentary adds another layer in the way the director interviews those who\r\nspent time with Jim in the field. We hear stories about his work ethic, his\r\nkindness and his empathy. He\u2019s the kind of man who on doing a story about an\r\nunder-funded hospital in Syria (in which they were transporting people via cab\r\nto the facility), he raised enough money to get them an ambulance. As sketched\r\nby his colleagues, Jim was a quiet man who felt like he was doing good by\r\nshining lights into dark corners of the world. His work ethic really comes\r\nthrough in these chapters of the film. The people who knew him in the field\r\ncome to life when they talk about him. \u201cJim\u201d transcends typical talking-head documentary when Oakes\r\ngets to interviewing the people who were held captive with Foley in Syria. They\r\nspeak of a man who sacrificed himself for others, always trying to look past\r\nthe horror of his situation. He would create games for them to play in\r\ncaptivity, and, again, these men who spent days and nights in physical agony\r\nspeak glowingly of a man who changed their lives simply by being a part of it.\r\nAs captured by \u201cJim,\u201d James Foley was a man who impacted everyone he met,\r\nwhether he did so in the comfort of his family home, in the field, or in\r\ncaptivity. Advertisement \u201cJim: The James Foley Story\u201d is undeniably, primarily a\r\ntalking-head documentary\u2014a series of interviews more than anything else\u2014and that\u2019s\r\na type of non-fiction filmmaking that critics are increasingly tiring of,\r\nwith good reason. We need new ways to tell true stories other than through\r\ninterviews. However, I\u2019m more forgiving of it here for a few reasons. Not only is\r\nOakes\u2019 interview approach\u2014the three different groups\u2014more deliberate than a\r\ntraditional then-this-happened documentary, but it\u2019s an appropriate style for a\r\nmovie about a man whose greatest impact was on the people he met. And so we\r\nhear from those people. In doing so from three definitive angles\u2014family,\r\nwork, captivity\u2014we get a full picture of a man. Not a victim in an orange\r\njumpsuit turned into a symbol. A compassionate, caring brother, son, friend,\r\ncolleague and journalist."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "John Doe: Vigilante", "Review": "The shrill and sanctimonious \"John Doe: Vigilante\" alternates between diatribes about the ineffectiveness of the justice system and gratuitous, gory clips of repeat offenders dying the brutal, bloody deaths they \"deserve.\" These moments are tied together by a series of monotonous interviews and inauthentic television news reports.  This is supposed to be a thriller, by the way. It's more of a slog, not so much a whodunit as a whydunit\u2014and by the end, it's: Who cares? The numbingly repetitive film from director Kelly Dolen and screenwriter Stephen M. Coates calls to mind the kind of rant you'd hear on AM talk radio\u2014then reach for the dial to switch off as quickly as possible.  Advertisement \"Battlestar Galactica\" star Jamie Bamber plays the title character: a handsome, self-styled vigilante killer who's on trial for murdering 33 people. On the eve of his verdict, he grants an exclusive interview in prison to smug investigative journalist Ken Rutherford (Lachy Hulme), a sort of Australian Geraldo Rivera. As he tells his story, \"John Doe: Vigilante\" skips around in time between his various crimes as well as the crimes his targets committed. Pedophile priests, date rapists, abusive husbands\u2014all horrible people who've been convicted, sentenced and eventually released to enjoy a second chance, only to commit their crimes again.  John Doe hunts them down and takes them out, finishing the job the courts couldn't. \"The world's a better place now,\" he tells his questioner defiantly. But he also acknowledges: \"Killing's easy. It's the living with it that's the hard part.\" So he's conflicted, which is nice. It's a rare showing of emotional complexity in a film that has a firm stance on a polarizing topic.  We also see Rutherford interview several peripheral figures who found themselves caught up in the frenzy of John Doe's killing spree. Over-the-top online news reporter Sam Foley (Gary Abrahams) is all too happy to broadcast video of John Doe's gruesome deeds when Australia's television networks refuse to do so, and he serves as his self-appointed mouthpiece to the masses. \"If you are a law-abiding citizen, then you have nothing to fear,\" he states dramatically into his microphone. \"There is a method to John Doe's madness.\"   Another hanger-on, Murray Wills (Sam Parsonson), forms a group called Speak for the Dead to support John Doe as his celebrity grows, and he revels in a bit of his own cult of personality in the process. Soon there's an army of vigilante killers dressing just like John Doe in dark hoodies and masks, beating people to a pulp with baseball bats in the middle of the night.  These guys are red herrings\u2014untrustworthy sorts positioned as possible co-conspirators. There is no mystery in \"John Doe: Vigilante,\" no tension. This is no \"Zodiac\"\u2014we know he's the serial killer from the very beginning. In theory, we're supposed to be on the hook to find out what inspired a seemingly intelligent, reasonable guy to commit such horrific acts. (We're also waiting to find out what his verdict is; the film teases it at the beginning, but then an explosion in the packed crowd outside the courthouse sends everything into a tizzy.)   Advertisement It's all a dull, repetitive slog of talking heads saying the same thing over and over in slightly different ways, and it never picks up steam. Eventually, though, John Doe's motivations become clear once we see the videotape of his final victim\u2014the man whose actions inspired his vigilantism in the first place. This pivotal scene in which he interrogates and tortures this man should be fraught with tension, but it just drags on and on. Once it airs live on the Internet, it's also supposedly the most-watched program ever broadcast, which is just laughable.   Dolen's film ends with a \"Network\"-esque call to action as our smooth anti-hero finally snaps, looking into the camera and screaming that we are all John Doe. Now where did I put that remote control \u2026? *click*"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Adult World", "Review": "There are probably poetry majors who do just fine once they must face the everyday realities outside of their campus cocoon\u2014that is, when they aren't busy dodging bill collectors coming after them for overdue student loan payments. I am just guessing here, but unless you are a rapper, jingle writer or Maya Angelou, versifying isn't going to pay the rent.  That is the ticklish pickle that \"Adult World\"'s Amy (Emma Roberts, whose grating cutesy-klutziness makes her come off more like a neurotic middle-schooler than a recent college grad) finds herself in, once she steps forth from Syracuse University and finds that few potential employers are impressed by her ambitions as a bard. Her understanding parents want to support her artistic pursuits, but not when it comes to providing free room and board as well as funding the postage cost for all her rejected literary mag and writing contest submissions. Advertisement There is another conundrum to overcome in this coming-of-age comedy: Saddled with unjustified confidence and a total lack of actual life experience, this over-coddled wordsmith is better at self-delusion than she is at self-expression.  So Amy does what a desperate girl must do when stuck in a chilly, perpetually overcast city in upstate New York with few prospects and a Sylvia Plath poster on her wall: Take a job working in a sex shop hawking naughty DVDs, glossy skin publications and sundry erotic playthings. But not before she spazzes out and knocks down a dildo display in a fit of hysteria when she realizes exactly where the \"Help Wanted\" sign outside has led her.  There is nothing to worry about, though. Adult World, as the store is both literally and metaphorically known, is less a den of iniquity than a source of colorful characters whose back stories would probably make for a more satisfying movie than Amy's.  Your mood may brighten when it is revealed that the proprietress of Adult World is Cloris Leachman, but it is destined to deflate when it becomes obvious that director Scott Coffey (Ellie Parker) and writer Andy Cochran have forgotten to give her anything interesting to do. Evan Peters (Roberts' \"American Horror Story\" co-star and real-life fianc\u00e9) adds some dark-horse depth to Alex, a fellow clerk who clearly would like to get to know Amy better for some reason. Then we get a throwback to the midnight cult movies of yore with cross-dressing customer Rubia (Armando Riesco, managing to sidestep the more treacherous clich\u00e9s even in high heels), who deigns to take Amy under her wing while providing temporary shelter.  At this point, you might say to yourself: Hey, I saw \"Boogie Nights\". Why is Adult World even in business considering you can download porn and order sex toys on the Internet? It falls into Alex's lap to come up with an excuse, something about the old-school pleasures of perusing shelves and immediate gratification. Right. Probably the same reason that there is a small bookstore thriving nearby, where Amy learns that her absolutely favorite all-time poet Rat Billings is doing a signing. And thank goodness she does, because that allows John Cusack to enter the picture as a onetime enfant terrible of couplets who peaked at 18 and has grown into a bitter, sardonic scribe coasting on his early glory. What does Amy do when she encounters her hero for the first time? She knocks down those in line at the signing and later shrieks at her would-be mentor, \"I just want to smash your head open and take everything in there.\"  Advertisement Billings tries to run but he cannot hide since he lives and works in the area. He and Amy form a tentative relationship\u2014she cleaning up his home and he muttering subtle insults under his breath while attempting to give this unfocused creature a clue about how to cultivate her seemingly meager talents. Or as he derisively notes, \"You would be the type of muse I would get.\" Cusack's distinctive handling of his sullen poet offers an opportunity for \"Adult World\" to make a statement about youthful ambition and middle-age disillusionment beyond Billings dubbing Amy and her peers as \"Generation Mundane.\""}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Seven Days in Utopia", "Review": "I would rather eat a golf ball than see this movie again. It tells the dreadful parable of a pro golfer who was abused by his dad, melts down in the Texas Open and stumbles into the clutches of an insufferable geezer in the town of Utopia (pop. 375), who promises him that after seven days in Utopia, he will be playing great golf. He will also find Jesus, but for that, you don't have to play golf, although it might help. The geezer is named Johnny Crawford. He is played by Robert Duvall. Only a great actor could give such a bad performance. Duvall takes the arts and skills he has perfected for decades and puts them at the service of a flim-flam man who embodies all the worst qualities of the Personal Motivation Movement. That is the movement that teaches us that if we buy a book, view some DVDs or sit for hours in the \"Conference Center\" of some crappy hotel, we won't be losers anymore.  Advertisement How do we know we were losers? Because we were suckers for the fraud. How will we know we are winners? When we rent our own hotel rooms and fleece the innocent. The formula of the movement can be seen at work in this classified ad: Send 25\u00a2 for the secret of how to receive lots of quarters in your mail. \"Seven Days in Utopia\" stars Lucas Black as Luke Chisholm, whose father (Joseph Lyle Taylor) has browbeaten him sadistically since childhood to force him to become a pro golfer. When Luke's game blows up on the final hole of the Texas Open, the old man turns his back on him and stalks away in full view of the TV cameras. Devastated, Luke drives blindly into the night and stumbles across the town of Utopia, where he has a Meet Cute with Johnny Crawford. Johnny runs a nearby golf resort, and wouldn't you know it, will take exactly seven days to repair Luke's truck, which is how long Johnny needs to work his spells on the young man. Robert Duvall can play crafty con men as well as anyone. I was looking for a twinkle in his eye as he inflicts young Luke with his bull$#!t, but unfortunately I'm afraid the character is intended to be real. Only exposing him as a boring fraud could possibly redeem him. The three great secrets of golf, we learn, are to \"See it. Feel it. Trust it.\"  Johnny Crawford's approach is a variation on the methods always used in the movies by wise old gurus to redeem clueless young men. To make Luke a better golfer, he makes him paint landscapes, go fly fishing, and attend church with him on Sunday. He forgets to train him to capture flying golf balls with a pair of chopsticks. Johnny has a wife (Melissa Leo) who nurtures the forlorn youth. There is a pretty girlfriend who has been kept on hold for a lifetime, waiting for Luke's putt shot. The landscape is majestic; Luke spends much time regarding its vistas from horseback from high plateaus while the soundtrack swells devoutly. Utopia is another one of those movie towns where every citizen, without exception, knows all the others and can always be found in the local restaurant. There is a TV on the wall where they all watch nothing but golf and know exactly who poor Luke is. One of the local men has his eye on the diner's comely waitress, but when the slicker turns up, does he get mean and possessive? Not a chance. The good people of Utopia have such charity that they give up their homes, families, horses, cows, waitresses and dogs to the wayfaring stranger. Let me give you an idea what good people these are. Many things go wrong during the week. Many, many things. All this in the land beyond San Antonio. Do we hear the f-word? Do we hear the s-word? Do we even hear the d-word or the h-word? No, dear reader. This is the first general audience movie in quite some time that is rated G. Robert Duvall must seldom have had a greater challenge to overcome. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Dark Horse", "Review": "I have a soft spot for sports movies where an underdog comes up from behind, culminating in a moment of pure triumph. The genre can be hokey or sentimental, but there is an underlying power and inspiration in those cliches. \"The Dark Horse\" is a great example. Based on the true story of Maori speed-chess master Genesis Potini, and directed by James Napier Robertson, it's a feel-good story \r\nwith the potential to make you feel great. What makes it unique is the Maori background, the atmosphere of poverty and violence in the community, a people marked by the genocide perpetrated upon them. In that environment, chess becomes not only a life-saver for kids who are born into inherited hopelessness, but also a metaphor for strategies on how to get through life. Strategy combats chaos, strategy focuses people on one goal, and with strategy, winning is actually possible. That's what \"The Dark Horse\" is all about.\u00a0 Advertisement Genesis Potini is the center of \"The Dark Horse,\" (his nickname in the chess world) and the film is as much a character study as anything else. Potini had a bipolar diagnosis (treated realistically in the film with not a whiff of condescension or grandstanding), and spent his life in and out of hospitals, with short jail stints for vagrancy. He was a phenom-prodigy at chess, winning competitions, and eventually helping form a chess club for underprivileged kids in his community called The Eastern Knights (the organization still exists today; Potini died in 2011). Potini's older brother taught him how to play chess when they were kids, presenting the different chess pieces as nearly-mythological figures with special powers. Chess was a way for them to access the pride of their culture and history, the fact that they all \"once were warriors.\" It is a militaristic game played by two people, but what happens on the board is a group event, and that was how Potini viewed the game. Genesis is portrayed by wonderful character actor, Cliff Curtis, so unforgettable in the Maori dramas \"Once Were Warriors\" and \"Whale Rider,\" as well as in small roles in \"Three Kings,\" \"Training Day\" and \"The Insider.\" (Currently, Curtis can be seen stealing AMC's \"Fear the Walking Dead.\") The actor has an imposing lumbering presence, reminiscent of Lee J. Cobb, and a malleable face. In \"The Dark Horse,\" he returns to New Zealand to take on one of the best roles in his career. As the toothless Genesis he is ruminative, gentle, often detached from surrounding events, but when he plays chess he is a ferocious competitor who can see six or seven moves ahead.\u00a0 \"The Dark Horse\" opens with a dream-like sequence in which Genesis, in the grip of manic hallucinations, staggers down the middle of a street in the rain, heading into a \"curios\" store as though by appointment. There's an old-fashioned chess set on display, and Genesis stands over it, dripping rainwater onto the board, playing a game against himself as the well-dressed, white customers stand back, watching. Genesis is taken off to jail for disturbing the peace, and then released into the custody of his older brother, Ariki (Wayne Hapi). Ariki is entrenched in Maori gang-culture, the house filled with scary-looking drunk tattooed guys who stare at Genesis with contempt.\u00a0 Advertisement Genesis seeks out an old chess buddy, who runs an after-school chess club for local kids and offers his services as a coach. It is when Genesis starts teaching the kids chess in an old ramshackle shed that the film takes off. The group of kids are not professional actors. They come from Genesis' world. They look like street kids; trash-talking, rambunctious, but also incredibly sweet and transparent to the camera. Genesis is an excellent and inspiring teacher, and decides, on impulse, that he wants to take the kids to the Auckland junior chess tournament. To say that it's a \"long shot\" that the kids will make any kind of a good showing in Auckland is an understatement.\u00a0 \"The Dark Horse\" takes time to portray Genesis' conflicts with his brother, his growing relationship with his nephew Mana (the young James Rolleston, in an extraordinary performance), and his devotion to passing on his love of chess to the kids, hoping that it will provide for them what it provided him: guidance, a sense of possibility, and maybe even a \"way out.\" This central theme is made most explicit in the case of Mana, who is in the process of going through a brutal gang-initiation, at his father's urging.\u00a0  The film is inspired by \"Dark Horse,\" Jim Marbrook's 2003 documentary about Potini.\u00a0 Robertson spent time with the real life Potini while adapting his story into a dramatic feature. He has a great respect for the bare bones of the story, and relishes the exuberance of the kids, their different personalities, their transformation into competitors. The chess tournaments are total nail-biters. Dana Lund's score pulses beneath much of the action, throbbing single notes that underline the urgency, rather than manipulating audience-response. Advertisement The way \"The Dark Horse\" unfolds may be the ultimate in sports-movie cliches. But that doesn't mean there is no suspense, that it's a \"done deal\" that the kids will be able to handle the pressure of entering a mostly white middle-class pursuit such as chess. (In this respect, the film is reminiscent of \"Stand and Deliver,\" another sports-genre movie, where Edward James Olmos plays an inner-city math teacher determined to teach calculus to a student population underestimated and ignored.) As Genesis gives his chess lectures, he has a couple of rules for his students. Their main job is to protect the King. Protecting the King takes on enormous significance considering their shared history. It's part of their epic story. Another rule he drums into them is that no piece on the board should be left behind. Circle the wagons around your community. Try to save everyone. And finally: Don't keep the focus on the rigid lines of figures on the board's edges, but launch yourself out into the center. The center is where the real battle goes down. Miguel Najdorf, the Argentianian grandmaster, said of Bobby Fischer, whose ruthlessness on the chess board was legendary: \u201cFischer wants to enter history alone.\u201d Genesis Potini, also ruthless when playing, viewed chess as a group endeavor (on the board and off). Entering history may not have been his goal, but if he were to enter history, his group must come with him."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Lucky Ones", "Review": "Three soldiers, home on a month's leave from Iraq, find themselves on an odyssey from New York to Las Vegas in \"The Lucky Ones.\" That's the setup. The journey involves your standard rest stops: friendly diners, dubious mechanics, fervent church people, roadside hookers, redneck saloons, lonely motels, tornadoes, casinos -- those sorts of things. This formula is fraught with pitfalls, but the characters and the actors redeem it with a surprising emotional impact. Tim Robbins plays the father figure, a fiftysomething career Army sergeant who received a back injury and is returning home to St. Louis. After a blackout shuts down JFK, he rents a car and ends up taking the others on board. Rachel McAdams plays Pvt. Colee Dunn, who has a leg injury and is heading for Vegas to return a guitar belonging to her boyfriend, who was killed in the war. Michael Pena plays Sgt. T.K. Poole, injured by shrapnel in the groin, who wants to go to Vegas to find hookers who can reawaken his equipment before he meets his stateside girlfriend. Advertisement Don't laugh when I say this: These three resemble in broad outline the three returning servicemen in the classic \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946). That film had an alcoholic older man returning to a loyal wife, a younger man returning to a sluttish wife and another afraid to marry his girlfriend because he had lost his hands. Change one man to a woman, shuffle a little, and you see what I mean. That's doesn't mean the film is a \"homage\"; director and co-writer Neil Burger told me he hasn't seen the 1946 film. It means the underlying structure and character group is somewhat archetypal. What distinguished \"Best Years\" was its gravitas. What makes \"The Lucky Ones\" so gratifying to me is anything but gravitas; these three characters are simply likable, warm, sincere and often funny. The performances are so good, they carry the film right along. Consider the events during the road trip. They are far from original. Many road movies are about what happens on the road. In \"The Lucky Ones,\" the events are somewhat inconsequential backdrops to the three-way relationship and the sympathy we feel for the characters. Yes, there are some considerable payoffs at the end, although not exactly unforeseen. There are also some plot contrivances that seem hauled in. I noted this, but didn't much mind. Rachel McAdams (\"The Notebook,\" \"Mean Girls\") comes into her own here. Previously she has been seen mostly as a hot chick (the title of her worst film) or an idealized sweetheart. Here she is feisty, vulnerable, plucky, warm, funny. This is her coming of age as an actress. She provides yet another lesson that you can't judge acting ability until you see an actor given a chance to really stretch. Watch the poignance of the scene when she meets her boyfriend's family. Michael Pena plays a type I recognize: young, earnest, prudent, brimming with unsolicited advice. The opposite of stereotypes. T.K. needs to grow up some more, of course. He is so obsessed with his groin injury because without sex, he says, he and his girlfriend have nothing in common. This is an upbeat film, which explains, I suppose, why the shrapnel aftereffects could be cured not by a doctor but by a hooker. If he and his girl have only sex in common, maybe she could have done the healing freelance. Along the way, Pena's T.K. provides a nudging counterpoint. Advertisement Tim Robbins' Army lifer is, above all, a decent man, and honest enough to reveal how he received his back injury in less than heroic circumstances. We sense he's been shepherding younger soldiers for most of his career, and now, during his leave, he's doing it again. He is not stupid, but he isn't the brightest bulb in the chandelier. He has a plan to finance his son's college tuition by winning in Vegas. This shows a touching but unwise fatherly love. Because we know how smart and quick Robbins is, it's uncanny how convincing he is as a steady and dependable calming hand. Movies about the war in Iraq have not been popular -- not even such a good one as \"In the Valley of Elah,\" with its Tommy Lee Jones performance. But as I wrote after seeing \"The Lucky Ones\" at Toronto, it is not an Iraq war movie. These three characters could be returning home from anywhere, for countless reasons. That might be a weakness in a film that wanted to make a statement about Iraq, but these three good and brave soldiers see the war in personal, not ideological terms; the film clearly focuses on their personalities more than their experiences. There were some reviews from Toronto that seemed to focus on its departure from some theoretical, serious war film. I believe audiences will be moved by the characters. I was.

{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "My All American", "Review": "\u201cMy All American\u201d earns most of its single shiny star by wasting no time in confirming its outright mushiness. Its first scene involves Aaron Eckhart, aged to a Clint Eastwood-like stoicism with the emphasis on white caterpillar eyebrows, answering a poor reporter\u2019s simple question about who his favorite All American player was, through his illustrious years of head-coaching the University of Texas to oodles of football victories. \u201cFreddie Steinmark,\u201d he says. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t All American,\u201d replies the reporter. \u201cNo,\u201d Eckhart pauses. \u201cHe was My All American.\u201d This film is based on a true story.\u00a0 Advertisement For those who don\u2019t take that titular line-drop as indication to head toward the nearest exits, \u201cMy All American\u201d offers viewers a thoroughly shameless hero piece. The titular personal champ is that of Freddie Steinmark (Finn Wittrock), a perfect specimen of a high school football player in the 1960s who seems to just be a little too short for college football, but he still has pro ball dreams. Surely enough, with his teammate James (Juston Street) and his beau at his side (Sarah Bolger\u2019s Linda), he makes it to UTexas, where he proves that his height is not really that much of an issue, and immediately impresses the legendary Coach Royal (Aaron Eckhart). Lacking the tobacco-chewing guff of every other clich\u00e9d coach in the movie, Coach Royal loves Freddie unquestionably, and never makes the viewer feel like Freddie has any obstacles to tackle.\u00a0 With a lead character who proves just how gratingly unnatural perfectionism is to human beings, (especially non-fictional ones like Freddie), writer/director Angelo Pizzo eschews any sense of true conflict for 90 minutes so that we can see how great of a player he must have been: Freddie gives gleaming, hopeful handshakes any time he\u2019s humbly upgraded in the squad by Coach Royal, himself a boring statue. \u201cFast Freddie\u201d is the speediest player on the squad but won\u2019t emotionally ditch his teammates. As a member of the UTexas, he\u2019s the first one to arrive at the locker room in the morning, and the last one to leave, because he\u2019s doing his studies. His shirt is always tucked in. He prays during montages. You spend the whole movie expecting him to die.\u00a0 Sure enough, once \u201cMy All American\u201d stops playing out like a grating montage with some football games mixed with\u00a0shiny moments of Freddie Doing Good, as set to incessant Aaron Copland-esque fanfare, something bad happens. It takes about 90 minutes for \u201cMy All American\u201d to take its true form as an homage to a football program, when UTexas ascended from a low record to the 1969 Cotton Bowl while Freddie had a personal battle off the field. During this, Pizzo\u2019s film does not aim towards any rich emotional victory, but it does want to show Freddie getting a five-minute standing ovation. To a credit for which he deserves better gigs, Wittrock shows a commitment to Pizzo\u2019s bizarre vision, going along with the film\u2019s desire to feel like its script was found in a 50-year-old time capsule, as originally composed with a PSA\u2019s squeaky cleanliness.\u00a0 Advertisement Oh, how fragile are these young American men who just want to wrestle over a pigskin and make mothers of their girlfriends. But be not fooled by its stalwart, magic hour machismo, \u201cMy All American\u201d is very much a Nicholas Sparks-esque weepie about a man and his football team, with the same delusional romance about The One. Even its loving exchanges between teammates on the gridiron (affectionate nicknames like \u201cLittle Dink\u201d) or in the locker room create a groaning comedy, as the story yearns to indulge a nostalgia for something that could have never existed like this, University of Texas lore be damned. But for those looking for a sports film of basic quality and genuine narrative, \"My All American\" is definitively useless."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Midnight in Paris", "Review": "This review contains spoilers. Oh, yes, it does, because I can't imagine a way to review \"Midnight in Paris\" without discussing the delightful fantasy at the heart of Woody Allen's new comedy. The trailers don't give it away, but now the reviews from Cannes have appeared, and the cat is pretty much out of the bag. If you're still reading, give yourself a fair chance to guess the secret by reading through the list of character names in the credits: \"Gert.\" Which resident of Paris does that make you think of? Advertisement This film is sort of a daydream for American lit majors. It opens with a couple on holiday in Paris with her parents. Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are officially in love, but maybe what Gil really loves is Paris in the springtime. He's a hack screenwriter from Hollywood who still harbors the dream of someday writing a good novel and joining the pantheon of American writers whose ghosts seem to linger in the very air he breathes: Fitzgerald, Hemingway and the other legends of Paris in the 1920s.  He'd like to live in Paris. Inez would like to live in an upper-class American suburb, like her parents. He evokes poetic associations with every cafe where Hemingway might once have had a Pernod, and she likes to go shopping. One night, he wanders off by himself, gets lost, sits on some church steps, and as a bell rings midnight, a big old Peugeot pulls up filled with revelers.  They invite him to join their party. They include Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Allen makes no attempt to explain this magic. None is needed. Nor do we have to decide if what happens is real or imaginary. It doesn't matter. Gil is swept along in their wake and finds himself plunged into the Jazz Age and all its legends. His novel was going to be about a man who ran a nostalgia shop, and here he is in the time and place he's most nostalgic for. Some audience members might be especially charmed by \"Midnight in Paris.\" They would be those familiar with Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, and the artists who frequented Stein's famous salon: Picasso, Dali, Cole Porter, Man Ray, Luis Bunuel and, yes, \"Tom Eliot.\" Allen assumes some familiarity with their generation, and some moviegoers will be mystified, because cultural literacy is not often required at the movies anymore. Others will be as charmed as I was. Zelda is playfully daffy, Scott is in love with her and doomed by his love, and Hemingway speaks always in formal sentences of great masculine portent.  Advertisement Woody Allen must have had a great time writing this screenplay. Gil is of course the Woody character (there's almost always one in an Allen film), and his fantasy is an enchanted wish-fulfillment. My favorite of all the movie's time-lapse conversations may be the one Gil has with Bunuel. He gives him an idea for a film: A group of guests sit down to dinner and after the meal is over, they mysteriously find themselves unable to leave the house. \"But why not?\" Bunuel asks. \"They just can't,\" Gil explains. Bunuel says it doesn't make any sense to him. If the story idea and perhaps the name Bunuel don't ring a bell, that's a scene that won't connect with you, but Allen seems aware that he's flirting with inside baseball, and tries to make the movie charming even for someone who was texting all during high school. Owen Wilson is a key to the movie's appeal. He makes Gil so sincere, so enthusiastic, about his hero worship of the giants of the 1920s. He can't believe he's meeting these people, and they are so nice to him \u2014 although at the time, of course, they didn't yet think of themselves as legends; they ran into ambitious young writers like Gil night after night in Miss Stein's salon. Another treasure in the film is Kathy Bates' performance. She is much as I would imagine Gertrude Stein: an American, practical, no-nonsense, possessed with a nose for talent, kind, patient. She's something like the Stein evoked by Hemingway in A Moveable Feast, his memoir of this period. She embodies the authority that made her an icon. Then there's Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who has already been the mistress of Braque and Modigliani, and is now Picasso's lover, and may soon \u2014 be still, my heart! \u2014 fall in love with Gil. Compared to her previous lovers, he embodies a winsome humility, as well he might. Meanwhile, life in the present continues, with Gil's bride-to-be and future in-laws increasingly annoyed by his disappearances every night. And there's another story involving a journey even further into the past, indicating that nostalgia can change its ingredients at a movable feast. Advertisement This is Woody Allen's 41st film. He writes his films himself, and directs them with wit and grace. I consider him a treasure of the cinema. Some people take him for granted, although \"Midnight in Paris\" reportedly charmed even the jaded veterans of the Cannes press screenings. There is nothing to dislike about it. Either you connect with it or not. I'm wearying of movies that are for \"everybody\" \u2014 which means, nobody in particular. \"Midnight in Paris\" is for me, in particular, and that's just fine with moi."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Most Hated Woman in America", "Review": "\u201cMy mother pissed off a lot of people, especially those she was close to.\u201d There\u2019s an undeniable wealth of storytelling to be culled from the life of Madalyn Murray O\u2019Hair, a talk show regular and fighter for religious freedom who was kidnapped in the \u201890s and held for ransom. She fought back against what she saw as the hypocrisy of a religious community that shunned her after a second pregnancy as a single woman, starting a legal battle to remove prayer from schools and the words \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance. Realizing she could make a profit as an anti-religious leader, she founded American Atheists, getting donations large enough to make her rich, and a target of those who wanted her cash. She was once called \"The Most Hated Woman in America,\u201d and the Netflix Original that tries to tell her story takes that name as well. I said tries because you have learned about as much reading this intro as you will about Madalyn Murray O\u2019Hair in the course of this disappointing, narratively flat film. Advertisement Melissa Leo plays the controversial figure, although she\u2019s often forced to fight through bad, old-age makeup to convey character. We see Madalyn at several key points in her life, but the majority of the film focuses on the kidnapping in August of 1995 by David Waters (Josh Lucas), Gary Karr (Rory Cochrane) and Danny Fry (Alex Frost), a trio of guys who just wanted to get $1 million and head for the border. To say it didn\u2019t go well would be an understatement. Oddly, no one seemed to care that Madalyn, her son Jon (Michael Chernus) and her granddaughter Robin (Juno Temple) were gone. Murray O\u2019Hair had pulled publicity stunts in the past, so the cops didn\u2019t investigate her disappearance, even though her ally Roy (Brandon Mychal Smith) knew that she wouldn\u2019t leave her beloved dogs at home.  Rob went to the press, getting in touch with San Antonio reporter Jack Ferguson (Adam Scott), who agreed that something didn\u2019t look right, and started publishing stories about the Murray O\u2019Hair disappearance. This \u201cinvestigative\u201d thread is used narratively to allow us into flashbacks about key moments in Madalyn\u2019s life, like her activism for religious freedom and the estrangement from her son Bill Jr. (Vincent Kartheiser), who now runs a fight for religious inclusion in the school system. Perhaps most bizarrely, director Tommy O\u2019Haver uses a lot of clips from Murray O\u2019Hair appearances, such as when she popped up on \u201cDonahue\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.\u201d A 90-minute film should never include this much recreated footage you could find online. The fact is that O\u2019Haver and co-writer Irene Turner never settle on an angle from which to tell this story. The history of Madalyn\u2019s life has a direct, then-this-happened biopic style. The film in which Adam Scott appears has a totally different tone, almost an outsider look at a crazy movie that could have worked on its own. And then there\u2019s the most frustrating film of all, the kidnapping tale that feels like it needed to have dark comedy elements like \u201cFargo\u201d or \u201cBernie\u201d but just comes off as flat and manipulative. Oh, I forgot one film\u2014the story of an estranged son. This is the most bizarrely melodramatic arc, as if O\u2019Haver thought it would add emotion to a story, but he doesn\u2019t have enough time to devote to it for it to register beyond a cautionary tale on how not use a manipulative score. Advertisement Clearly, any one of these films might have worked. Make the kidnappers the protagonists and tell the story of a trio of ne\u2019er-do-wells who stumble into a life-changing crime. Make the journalist the protagonist, and procedurally show us how he solved the kidnapping the police ignored. You could even tell the life story of the O\u2019Hairs in a way that focuses on her family, and ends with the headline-grabbing kidnapping. You simply can\u2019t tell all of these stories effectively in a 90-minute movie and give viewers any sort of character or insight. It results in a film that is simultaneously too much and nothing at all because it\u2019s jumping around so much narratively. And none of this haphazard storytelling is helped by a complete lack of visual language.  Through it all, a few performances actually increase the disappointment, for one wishes they were in a better film. Leo is perfect casting as a woman whose acerbic personality helped define her. Every time I see Josh Lucas, I wish he was in more movies, and he uses his physically imposing presence here in a way he\u2019s not often allowed to. And then there\u2019s Adam Scott, increasingly one of those actors who makes everything better. At one point, he says, \u201cI thought there might be a story here.\u201d There is, but \u201cThe Most Hated Woman in America\u201d doesn\u2019t really tell it."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Thor: Ragnarok", "Review": "I wouldn\u2019t have picked Chris Hemsworth as Marvel's breakout comedy star when he was first cast as Thor, God of Thunder, but he turned out to be one of the best things about this never-ending mega-franchise. He\u2019s tall, brawny and impossibly handsome, but there\u2019s a self-mocking twinkle in his eye. When Thor is in gung-ho jock mode, Hemsworth\u2019s wry machismo evokes the young Sean Connery as James Bond, raising an eyebrow at the corniness around him. When he bumbles and stumbles, there\u2019s a touch of Cary Grant to his embarrassment. And when he\u2019s playing things more or less straight, there\u2019s an average guyness to his reactions. All this humanizes an actor who\u2019s perpetually at risk of being treated as a life-sized action figure.\u00a0    Advertisement Hemsworth\u2019s charisma holds \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d together whenever it threatens to spin apart, which unfortunately is often. Written by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost and directed by Taika Waititi (\u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople,\u201d \u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows\u201d), this is almost but not quite a stand-alone picture, tethered to previous \u201cAvengers\u201d entries only by Thor\u2019s opening search for the Infinity Stones, which has led him to be imprisoned by the fire demon Sutur. The demon tells him that his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is no longer on Asgard and that their homeworld will soon be destroyed in Ragnarok, a prophesied apocalypse. After that, the film splits into a couple of parallel narratives.\u00a0    Fully half the film is a court intrigue/war picture, charting the takeover of Asgard by Thor\u2019s long lost sister Hela (Cate Blanchett), a black-clad force of nature who seems to turn into a demonic stag-beast when she fights: her head sprouts elegant antlers that might have been sketched in the air with a brush dipped in India ink. The other \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d is a largely comedic gladiator movie with prison thriller accents: Thor is trapped on the planet Sakaar, where he\u2019s forced to fight the planet\u2019s reigning champion, the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). As revealed in trailers, Tom Hiddleston\u2019s Loki is back, too\u2014and why wouldn\u2019t he be? He\u2019s easily the most entertaining villain, or antihero, in the franchise, so beguiling that when Thor inevitably succumbs to his charisma and fights alongside him, both he and the audience momentarily forget how much death and property destruction he\u2019s caused in prior chapters.\u00a0    The overqualified supporting cast does a lot with not-quite enough. Sakaar\u2019s \u201cGrandmaster\u201d is Jeff Goldblum, who gives exactly the sort of performance you\u2019d want Jeff Goldblum to give in a project like this: intellectually detached, droll and smart-alecky, yet also somehow petty, arbitrary and sadistic. Goldblum's unique genius is his ability to toss off lines that might've seemed as overripe as week-old avocados on the page, like, \"Let's have a hand for all of our undercard competitors who died so gruesomely.\" (From the inventive way he adds \"ums\" and \"ahhs,\" you can tell that he's also a jazz musician.)\u00a0The worst thing I can say about him is that he\u2019s more appealing here than well-used. Either there should have been a lot more of him\u2014though not at the expense of Blanchett, who\u2019s a slinky hoot\u2014or his efforts should\u2019ve been more finely shaped by the filmmakers, so that his brilliance cohered into a bona fide character or else pushed on towards toward Dadaist madness, like Tim Curry as Dr. Frank N. Furter in \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" or the late Gene Wilder\u2019s title performance in \u201cWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\u201d (The latter seems to have been what Waititi and company were going for in casting Goldblum: when Thor is introduced to Sakaar, \u201cPure Imagination\u201d plays on the soundtrack.)\u00a0    Advertisement As Valkyrie, an alcoholic bounty hunter who once fought against Hela and now works for The Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson more than holds her own in scenes opposite Hiddleston, Hemsworth and Ruffalo. She's hard-boiled, like a tough dame in a 1940s detective film spitting wisecracks. As Skurge, a warrior who survives Hela\u2019s destructive takeover of Asgard and joins her in order to survive, \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d star Karl Urban captures the unhappiness of a\u00a0 sellout who knows he\u2019s better than the life he\u2019s expediently chosen; but so much of his performance is reduced to anguished reaction shots that you may wonder\u2014as you might with Thompson\u2014whether the best bits got cut for pacing.\u00a0    In the run-up to release, much was made of the allegedly drastic shift in tone that would make this project unique. It was sold as a light, funky, largely comedic effort\u2014practically a spoof of Marvel\u2019s usual, with Thor and the Hulk serving as the anchor of, basically, a buddy movie, like the kind\u00a0 Bob Hope and Bing Crosby used to churn out. There are times when it gets close to that promised film, and when it hits pay dirt, it is delightful\u2014particularly during very broad slapstick moments, as when Hulk enters the arena and Thor laughs with relief and announces, \u201cI know him\u2014he's a friend from work!\u201d; and in moments of relatively subdued character development, as when Thor and Hulk commiserate in private and we learn that the big green guy loves it on Sakaar because the people treat him as an athletic superstar and folk hero, in contrast to the pariah treatment he gets back on Earth. (When you\u2019re mainly good at Hulk Smash, it\u2019s a relief to land a job that asks you to do nothing but.)   \u00a0    When Hulk turns back into Bruce Banner, Ruffalo reminds us that he\u2019s giving two performances here, both superb. He revels in the looming physicality of Hulk\u2014a motion capture performance on par with Andy Serkis\u2019 best\u2014but when he turns back into a regular man, he seems to shrink within himself. He\u2019s unafraid to use his shortness for laughs, appearing side-by-side against the towering Hemsworth in wide shots like the superhero answer to Laurel and Hardy. Banner\u2019s complaints are small, too\u2014and yet they aren\u2019t, because of their recognizable humanity: \u201cYou\u2019re just using me to get to Hulk,\u201d he whines. \u201cIt\u2019s gross. You\u2019re a bad friend.\u201d   \u00a0    Advertisement Unfortunately, as is often the case with Marvel films, the adventurous aspects aren\u2019t adventurous enough, and the more predictable aspects\u2014the CGI-saturated fight scenes, with bodies whirling through the air; the wide shots of cities burning and giant creatures on the rampage; the images of whooshing, twisting star gates and bodies falling from the sky like meteors\u2014are more frenzied and loud than inspired, and eventually become monotonous. The movie's final third, yet another Marvel Big Battle, is as tedious as the first two-thirds are endearing. There's a whiff of post-colonialist critique in the presentation of Asgard as an empire that was founded on war but that now hypocritically congratulates itself for being peaceful,  but the screenplay doesn't develop the idea as well as it might. A climactic twist, which I won\u2019t reveal here, is presented in such a tonally inappropriate way that it calls the film\u2019s entire approach into question. (\u201cAnt-Man\u201d\u2019s status as the best off-brand MCU film remains unchallenged.) Only the comic chemistry of the main quadrangle\u2014Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Thompson and Ruffalo\u2014prevents \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d from devolving into another standard-issue superhero crash-and-bash fest.Still, there\u2019s plenty to like here. Waititi, his cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (\u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d), and his production designer Dan Hennah take their cues from pop art-influenced comic book adaptations of the \u201860s and \u201870s, like TV\u2019s \u201cBatman,\u201d \u201cLogan\u2019s Run,\u201d \u201cFlash Gordon\u201d and \u201cThe Black Hole,\u201d filling the screen with kitschy costumes, furniture, artifacts and machinery envisioned in the tiled, knobby style of the late, great illustrator Jack Kirby, and presenting it all in oversaturated color. The disco-drug-trip gaudiness is a welcome change of pace from superhero cinema\u2019s default bled-by-leeches look. At one point, Thor gripes about the red-and-white patterning of the capital city's interiors, as well he should: they\u2019re hideous. Mark Mothersbaugh, the onetime Devo co-founder and composer who scored four Wes Anderson films, creates a retro-synth soundtrack suited to the era of science fiction cinema in which characters wore jumpsuits. This is a close-but-no-cigar movie, but so enjoyable for the most part, and so modest in its aims, that its disappointments aren\u2019t devastating. I\u2019d watch the first 90 minutes again anytime."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Sleuth", "Review": "When \"Sleuth\" premiered last month at the Toronto Film Festival, a great many critics (including me), writing in advance about it sight unseen, described it as a \"remake\" of the 1972 film based on Anthony Shaffer's stage play. The festival program was more accurate, describing it as \"a fascinating transformation.\" So it is. Do not make the mistake of thinking that if you've seen the earlier play or film, you've got this one covered. Yes, one of the plot gimmicks is the same, but be honest: If you saw the original, you'd already heard about the gimmick, anyway, hadn't you? Only the London opening night audience possibly experienced it as a surprise. Advertisement The story isn't about the gimmick, anyway. It's about the vicious verbal duel that two men perform one edgy night. Andrew Wyke (Michael Caine), a millionaire thriller novelist, receives a very late visitor: Milo Tindle (Jude Law), who is having an affair with Wyke's wife. The weathered country house exterior of his country estate is belied by the interior, an alarming display of metal, glass, crystal, modernist sculpture and an advanced spy-cam security system. This is not a house to be lived in, but to be shown through. It's hard to say which would be more terrifying, the notion that Wyke did the interior design or that his wife did. I vote for the wife. Every real man needs a La-Z-Boy somewhere. Wyke starts in right at the door, asking Tindle, \"Is that your car?\" Well, there are only two cars parked in the drive, and since the other is Andrew's, why, yes, it is Milo's. \"Your car is smaller than my car,\" Wyke says. Is this remark juvenile or advanced adult cruelty, a comment so gauche, it is intended as an insult to the listener? We ask questions like that all through the movie, which is based on a new screenplay by Harold Pinter, the Nobel laureate playwright. True, Pinter is now 77, and we know from the journals of his friend Simon Gray that he has been ill, but is the great man now reduced to rewriting old country house mysteries? Not at all. He has written a new country house mystery, which is not really a mystery at all in terms of its plot, and eerily impenetrable in its human relationship. What is really at stake between Andrew and Milo? Does either one love the wife? Do both? Would Andrew be just as happy to get her off his hands, or does he want to keep her just to prove there is a reason he has the bigger car? The suspense in the film is not about who gets the wife, but about who wins the conversation. Assume someone who has never heard nor seen the original \"Sleuth,\" but is familiar with the work of Pinter. That would include a lot of English professors. Attending only to the dialogue, they would find the film pure Pinter. Advertisement And that is what you should do. Cast out all thoughts of wives, adultery, disguises, accents, ploys, surprises and denouements, and simply listen to the words and watch Caine and Law at work. You will observe the Pinteresque interplay of paradox and contradiction, the answers that didn't quite seem to hear the question, the statements of matters so obviously true that perhaps something else altogether is meant by them. In Pinter, the most banal dialogue can carry disturbing insinuations. Then try to decide when the characters (not the actors) are acting, and when they are not. Do they mean what they say? Do they feel what they do? There is a third act development that is entirely absent in the original. What does it mean? Which man takes it seriously? Both? Neither? Each one calling the other's bluff? When Pinter saw or read the original material, I wonder if he thought: What this needs is the Pinter touch.  The director is Kenneth Branagh, himself a master of stagecraft and a lover of theatrical gesture. How brilliant he was in his film \"Hamlet\" (1996) to have the prince address his great soliloquy to his own reflection in a mirror. Look again at his underrated \"Dead Again\" (1991) and see his joy in dazzling effect. In \"Sleuth\" what he celebrates is perplexing, ominous, insinuating material in the hands of two skilled actors. Law, interestingly, takes the role played by Caine in 1972, and Caine fills the role played then by Laurence Olivier. Caine, who has never been much for the stage, is a superb screen actor, so good his master classes on acting for the camera are on DVD. Here, dry and clipped, biting and savage, he goes for the kill. Law does a plucky job with Milo Tindle, but isn't it one of the laws of drama that characters named Milo Tindle never have a chance? Note: Now, all of that said, why do I give the movie three stars, instead of more? Curiously enough, because in its strength is its weakness. It is so much about dialogue and performance that I, at least, found myself thinking more about the actors than the characters. All the same, as exactly what it is, it's fascinating."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Old Dogs", "Review": "\"Old Dogs\" is stupefying dimwitted. What were John Travolta and Robin Williams thinking of? Apparently their agents weren't perceptive enough to smell the screenplay in its advanced state of decomposition, but wasn't there a loyal young intern in the office to catch them at the elevator and whisper, \"You've paid too many dues to get involved with such crap at this stage in your careers.\" In this turkey, Williams and Travolta play business partners trying to float a big deal with Japan. Meanwhile, they're saddled with baby-sitting 6-year-old twins. The film makes a big business meeting in Las Vegas with Japanese investors a study in laugh-avoidance. The Japanese line up on one side of a table in a Japanese restaurant, and Travolta, Williams, their partner Seth Green and a translator are on the other. Travolta tries to warm them up with the funny story of how Williams just got divorced twice in the last 24 hours. The Japanese sit stony-faced. So do we. Then Travolta gets to his big finish, and the Japanese break into helpless laughter. My theory: Since almost all Japanese businessmen in Vegas speak English, they've been playing a practical joke. Advertisement \"Old Dogs\" seems to have lingered in post-production while editors struggled desperately to inject laugh cues. It obviously knows no one will find it funny without being ordered to. How else to explain reaction shots of a dog responding to laugh lines? Or the painfully obvious use of music as obvious as a yellow highlighter, to point out comedy? Example: Rita Wilson gets her hand slammed by a car trunk lid, and the soundtrack breaks into \"Big Girls Don't Cry.\" Another clue is when characters break into bad sitcom dialogue. After the Old Boys end up at camp with their young charges, a muscular counselor (Matt Dillon) asks them, \"You girls ready to play a little Ultimate Frisbee?\" Williams: \"I think so, Mr. Testosterone.\" Another clue: \"funny moments\" repeated in case we missed them. Example: Robin Williams test-drives a buckled-on, back-mounted device that allows him to fly. It loses power, and he drops into a pond. Wow, that was funny! Wait! Here it is again! Same drop, new angle! Twice as funny! Oh, no! A third drop! Ohmigod! Wait -- wait -- a fourth time? Usher, quick! Bring me oxygen! Seth Green is not a tall man. But hell, he's only three inches shorter than Williams. In this movie, you'd think Green was Danny DeVito. He ends up wrapped in the arms of a gorilla. Never mind why. Doesn't matter. First Law of Movie Gorillas: Guy in a gorilla suit is never funny, unless the joke is on him. To save himself from the enormous beast, Green sings a soothing lullaby. The gorilla dozes off peacefully. Hey, that's good! That's very good! Green gently tries to extricate himself from gorilla's embrace. Nothing doing! Green desperately starts crooning again. Just think. If the gorilla wakes up, Green will be crushed to death! Man, oh, man! The release of \"Old Dogs\" was delayed from April until now because of the death of another of its co-stars, Bernie Mac. I can think of another way that they might have respected his memory.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Violet & Daisy", "Review": "James Gandolfini will probably always be known as Tony Soprano from \"The Sopranos,\" but he's such a versatile and surprising performer that within a few minutes of watching him play a different character, you forget about his most famous role. There's a gentleness and decency to this actor that comes through even when he's playing men with very dark shadings. At the same time, though, there's something mysterious about him, a suggestion of menace, or at least deep hurt and dysfunction, and this prevents his nicer characters from becoming too milquetoast. Even when he's performing a seemingly straightforward role, he makes it seem as if you're seeing the tip of the psychological iceberg. Amazing as he was as Tony, very likely the role of his life, he was just as distinctive in \"True Romance,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"In the Loop,\" \"Romance and Cigarettes,\" \"Killing Them Softly,\" \"Cinema Verite\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" and as the voice of the monster in \"Where the Wild Things Are\" who struggled to contain his violent impulses. The only thing predictable about Gandolfini is his excellence. He's an actor you're always happy to see.\u00a0 Advertisement As Michael, a thief awaiting execution by two assassins in \"Violet & Daisy,\" Gandolfini adds another indelible portrait to his ever-growing collection. He's marked for death for daring to steal from a criminal kingpin, but he lives longer than he should simply by being so unpredictable, so odd and sweet. In one scene, the assassins burst into a room where they expect Michael to be seated in a chair and unload dozens of rounds at him, only to discover that he's moved; when he appears in another part of the room, he's holding a tray of freshly-baked cookies, and offers some to the would-be killers. Gandolfini's face is so warm and genuine, yet so mysteriously unsettling, that this seems like plausible behavior. Gandolfini's quietly magnificent performance is the only reason to see \"Violet & Daisy,\" a thriller that might as well have been released in 1996, when everybody and their brother and their sister and their cousin twice-removed was trying to be Quentin Tarantino, writing screenplays about loquacious hit men and gangsters and molls delivering cutesy monologues in wacky, not-quite-real universes. The aforementioned assassins, \u00a0Violet (Alexis Bledel) and Daisy (Saoirse Ronan), are young, beautiful women whose blank-faced sweetness is a cover for their incredible and seemingly soulless violence.\u00a0 They live in one of those movie worlds that seems to contain underworld types and nothing else, one filled with signifiers and tropes and cliches borrowed from whatever films, TV shows and modern art movements the filmmaker enjoyed. They share a lovely little apartment that's art-directed, like every other set in the film, to look like the showroom of a vintage furniture and knicknacks emporium. They behave as if they're two little girls taking part in an endless slumber party, one that just happens to include violent hits carried out with silenced pistols, often with disguises employed. In an early sequence, Violet and Daisy pose as nuns delivering \"Righteous Pizza\" (the film apparently left out the scene where they create the convincingly monogrammed boxes) then engage in an elaborate, bloody gunbattle with thugs in an apartment building lobby, unloading round after pinpoint-accurate round. In their down time, they bounce on beds and look at fashion magazines and fantasize about saving enough money to buy pretty dresses they've had their eyes on. They ride to hits on tricycles. The previously-mentioned cookie scene only works because Violet and Daisy decided to close their eyes before leaping into the room and firing at their target -- another acknowledgement that they're overgrown girls, or emotionally arrested young woman, and that this is all a big game to them, no matter how hardboiled Violet acts. It's that kind of movie -- Tarantino by way of \"Juno\" or \"Son of Rambow\", childlike yet knowing, packed with bright, jumbled production design and mournful atmosphere, and sadly lacking soul.\u00a0 Advertisement Daisy, we're told, is all of eighteen, but has the sexual sophistication of a nine-year old, and Violet isn't much older. Violet is worried that Daisy can now be tried as an adult, should she ever be prosecuted for her crimes. The young women have an older sister-younger sister dynamic, with Daisy as the innocent/ignorant one -- a running gag involving a dirty joke that Daisy is too chaste-minded to get makes her seem as intellectually limited as Lenny from \"Of Mice and Men\" -- but both actresses give such monotonously flat performances that the characters never seem like much more than concepts, or perhaps walking allusions. But to what, exactly? The hit girl character from \"Kick-Ass\", perhaps? Or Sissy Spacek's morally arrested woman-child character in \"Badlands,\" who enabled her boyfriend's murder spree? Or something or someone else that, for whatever reason, just isn't coming across onscreen? The film's writer and director, Geoffrey Fletcher, won a screenwriting Oscar for adapting 2009's \"Precious.\" He has an eye, a sense of rhythm, and an impressive control of tone. This work doesn't lack for conviction. Everything about \"Violet & Daisy\" bespeaks certainty of vision. The filmmaker obviously knows why he's showing us certain things, and in a certain way. And yet none of gels into an emotionally or philosophically coherent experience, and the tone is so muted that the whole picture seems to have recently recovered from a botched facelift that made it inexpressive, like a mask.\u00a0 The lead actresses might have been capable of more than they show us here; likewise Danny Trejo, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and other reliably strong supporting players -- but they seem to be giving the director what he wants, and unfortunately it's hard to tell what, exactly, that might be. Only Gandolfini transcends the film's constricting, dot-the-I's-and-cross-the-Ts compulsiveness in sticking to its inscrutable agenda. In later scenes in which Michael and Daisy forge a weird yet affecting father and daughter-type relationship, one can glimpse a more direct and powerful film fighting to get out, and failing.\u00a0 Advertisement"}

Yet this is, in fact, the best way to view them with critical objectivity.\u00a0 \n The only \u201cso-bad-it\u2019s-good\u201d film I\u2019ve seen that has not only proven watchable but thoroughly entertaining on repeat viewings (without a sold-out crowd accompanying it) is Tommy Wiseau\u2019s 2003 cult sensation, \u201cThe Room.\u201d It\u2019s the funniest comedy ever accidentally made, fueled by a lead performance from writer/director Wiseau that is literally unlike anything ever put on film.

Consider a scene where he thanks his \u201cfuture wife\u201d Lisa for throwing him a birthday party. \u201cYou invited all my friends,\u201d he gushes. \u201cGood thinking!\u201d Above all, it is the sincerity with which Wiseau constructed his tragic melodrama that makes it not only hilarious but oddly endearing, and his subsequent attempt to be purposely funny (Hulu\u2019s disastrous sitcom, \u201cThe Neighbors\u201d) proves that he is not in on the joke.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Anyone who has attended an Alamo Drafthouse screening of \u201cThe Room\u201d can understand why Drafthouse Films has begun to distribute bad movies crafted by would-be artists as passionate as they are untalented. They\u2019re clearly searching for the next Wiseau, which is sort of like searching for the next Andy Kaufman or the next Stonehenge. Enter John S. Rad, an Iranian filmmaker who set out to make an American crime drama entitled \u201cDangerous Men\u201d in 1979. Somehow, the project remained uncompleted until 2005, when it received a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it release. Ten years later, the film had a surprise screening at Fantastic Fest, and the audience ate it up. Whether or not moviegoers across the country will respond to it with equal enthusiasm has yet to be seen. Seen all by itself, the film is dull and repellant trash with only a handful of laugh-out-loud moments. It\u2019s no funnier than \u201cBirdemic: Shock and Terror,\u201d James Nguyen\u2019s micro-budget Hitchcock riff, which worked much better as a two-minute trailer than a full-length feature.\u00a0 \n Right off the bat, it\u2019s clear that Rad is the singular visionary behind this picture. The opening credits consist entirely of his name, accompanied by various titles (he apparently served as producer and executive producer). He\u2019s also responsible for the film\u2019s abominable synth score, including a main theme so monotonous, it gives Torgo\u2019s theme from \u201cManos: Hands of Fate\u201d a run\u2014or perhaps, a hobble\u2014for its money. So incoherent are the film\u2019s jumbled plot lines that Rad never bothers to follow any of them toward a satisfactory conclusion. The primary story thread involves Mina (Melody Wiggins), a woman whose fianc\u00e9 is knifed to death by one of the film\u2019s numerous evil bikers. Rather than sob over her lover\u2019s bloody corpse, Mina snaps on the persona of a temptress, luring the smitten killer to his inevitable demise in a seedy motel room. A line destined to be among the film\u2019s most quoted occurs when Mina instructs the biker to rub her knees while licking her bellybutton\u2014an unusual method of foreplay, to say the least. \n Nearly all the men in Rad\u2019s film, aside from the obvious heroes, are rapists at heart, a fact that becomes quickly apparent after Mina murders the biker and hitches a ride from a mustached family man. \u201cShe\u2019s god\u2019s gift to a hen-pecked husband!\u201d he declares, before pressuring Mina into having sex. Instead, she holds his genitals at knifepoint, kicks him out of the car, forces him to disrobe, and leaves him stranded in the middle of nowhere. Rad\u2019s inexplicable decision to continue cutting back to the naked man, wandering around in bewildered embarrassment, results in some of the film\u2019s most memorably bizarre moments. Fretting like a neurotic comic relief, the man chastises his penis, exclaiming, \u201cIt\u2019s your own bloody fault! I should\u2019ve let her cut you off!\u201d Eventually, he surmises, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do out here\u2014but dance.\u201d And dance he does, all the while singing the melody from Strauss\u2019s \"Blue Danube\" waltz. If anything, it\u2019s the most pleasurable instance of music in the film.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Meanwhile, Mina morphs into a regular Aileen Wuornos, posing as a prostitute in order to kill as many men as possible. Her fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother, a cop named Clem, wants to bring all the evil bikers to justice, though his police chief orders him not to get involved. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Sit on my thumbs and wiggle my toes?\u201d Clem whines, creating a mental image stranger than anything in this movie. The chief should\u2019ve known that Clem wouldn\u2019t follow orders, considering that the actor playing the chief is clearly reading directly from the highlighted script pages on his desk. Anyway, it\u2019s not long before Clem is saving busty women from motorcycle-wielding predators, while grilling a bartender about the bikers\u2019 criminal overlord, Black Pepper, a bandana-clad doofus who has allegedly killed \u201cmore men than the \u2018Nam war.\u201d When Clem gives his name to the bartender, the man responds, \u201cRight, I think I\u2019ll call you Cling Cuckoo.\u201d Right.\u00a0 \n This is all much more fun to write about than it is to watch. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad music, bad sound and bad fight choreography can only take a film so far. A film must be entertaining on its own terms in order to be worth recommending, and \u201cDangerous Men\u201d is, for the most part, a bore. That won\u2019t stop midnight audiences from loving every frame of this moldy cheese-fest, but as Tommy Wiseau so indelibly noted, \u201cLove is blind.\u201d"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "True Story", "Review": "Based on a non-fiction account by one of its subjects,\r\nreal-life journalist Michael Finkel, the movie \u201cTrue Story\u201d spends much of its\r\n90 minutes trying to figure out just what it is. Murder mystery, journalism\r\nexpos\u00e9, courtroom drama, metaphysical inquiry into the secret-sharer nature of\r\ncertain American Bros, proof that James Franco and Jonah Hill can serious-act\r\nopposite one another\u2014it seems to be going for any one of these at any given\r\nmoment, and in the end winds up being not a whole lot more than ostentatiously\r\nunpleasant and ugly.  Advertisement Directed by first-time feature filmmaker albeit apparently\r\nwell-acclaimed British stage director Rupert Goold, \u201cTrue Story\u201d opens with a\r\nslow-motion overhead shot of a teddy bear drooping into an open suitcase and\r\nlanding next to a child who\u2019s lying in the suitcase in a fetal position. The\r\nchild turns out to be one of the alleged victims of Christian Longo (Franco)\r\nwho is soon arrested for killing his entire family\u2014a wife and three kids. Cut to\r\nHill\u2019s Finkel, in Africa at work on a major story\u2014perhaps his eighth or ninth New York Times Magazine cover gig, he crows to his wife once he\u2019s back in the\r\nStates\u2014and he\u2019s getting some of the detail work wrong, in a way that\u2019s going to\r\nbite him in the ass, big time. Exiled from the Times in disgrace, he retreats\r\nto his VERY cozy modern cabin in wintry Montana and Very Concerned But Fairly\r\nUnderstanding Academic Wife Jill (Felicity Jones), where he soon hears from an\r\nOregon reporter about a multiple murderer who had been using Finkel\u2019s identity\r\nat the time of his capture in Mexico. That would be Longo. Intrigued, Finkel\r\nrequests an interview with the accused. The accused accepts. He\u2019s a long-time\r\nadmirer of Finkel\u2019s work, it turns out. He makes Finkel an offer that any\r\nseasoned journalist would admit stinks to high heaven while at the same time\r\npresenting an undeniably potent temptation: If Finkel will keep the story to\r\nhimself until after the trial, and \u201cteach\u201d Longo how to write, Longo will give\r\nhis story exclusively to the writer whose identity he once pilfered.  It\u2019s kind of amusing that in a week in which much of the\r\nmedia-engaged real world is howling in outrage that an instance of journalistic\r\nmalfeasance at Rolling Stone hasn\u2019t resulted in a bunch of rolling heads, a\r\nmovie comes out that tries to make viewers feel bad about the entirely\r\njustified firing of a newspaper reporter who really did do the stuff he was\r\naccused by his bosses of doing. Man, King Crimson wasn\u2019t kidding about that 21st-Century-Schizoid-Man\r\ncondition. In any event, as per the movie\u2019s version of events, Finkel\u2019s eager\r\nacceptance of Longo\u2019s offer makes him look like an opportunist, and then the\r\nmovie goes on to make him look like a dumb opportunist. Marveling at the\r\nmacabre memoir Longo sends him on legal pad, Finkel is spooked by\r\ncorrespondences: Longo makes weird drawings in the margins of his pages, just like\r\nFinkel does. Jill raises an eyebrow at this, as one will, but the theme of\r\nHuman Duality And Darkness doesn\u2019t get much play. The screenplay, by Rupert\r\nGoold and David Kajganich, means to plant verbal clues here and there that will\r\npay off big time by the end; suffice it to say that to use the phrase \u201cwhen the\r\npenny drops\u201d to describe the resultant instances would be to severely overvalue\r\nthem. (Also, the writers seem to have a poor grasp of what a \u201cdouble negative\u201d\r\nactually is.)\u00a0 The film moves at a relatively clipping pace, but also has a\r\nweird sense of contingency, as if the filmmakers are filling in the required\r\ncomponents of this kind of scenario as they go along. For instance, about an\r\nhour into the movie, when all you\u2019ve seen of Longo is in exchanges between him\r\nand Finkel, who\u2019s trying desperately to milk a book deal out of his\r\ninvestigation of Longo, you\u2019re liable to think, \u201cDoesn\u2019t this accused killer\r\nhave a LAWYER? And if so\u2014because he probably should\u2014why hasn\u2019t Finkel had any\r\ncontact with him?\u201d And sure enough, the trial gets underway and yes, Longo DOES\r\nhave a lawyer. Strangely enough, it\u2019s about this time in the film that an\r\nofficial investigator, played by bullet-headed, active-jawed toughie Robert\r\nJohn Burke, leans on doughy, confused-looking Finkel\u2014better tell what you know,\r\nkid, because this Longo\u2019s trying to pull a fast one on the jury. This might\r\nelicit an uh-oh from viewers had the film presented any evidence that Longo\r\nmight not be guilty, except it doesn\u2019t. Finkel thinks he might be innocent,\r\nbecause otherwise all that secret sharer stuff might mean something scary. But\r\nreally, he\u2019s the only one. By the time Longo takes the stand to offer a story\r\nso preposterous on its face (not to mention probably actuarially\r\nunprecedented\u2014I thought of Edward G. Robinson\u2019s hole-punching insurance\r\ninvestigator in \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d and the fun he\u2019d have with this tale, and\r\nalso how much I would have preferred to be watching \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d) that\r\nyou\u2019re surprised the jurors don\u2019t break up laughing at it\u2014well, you have to\r\nwonder, if this Finkel had almost eight New York Times Magazine cover stories\r\nto his name, how hard can big-time journalism really be?  Advertisement Given that both Hill and Franco conduct themselves\r\nreasonably respectably\u2014I have to give Franco credit for not going full\r\nboogity-boogity Evil Dude with this character, which had to have been a\r\ntemptation\u2014the blame for this mess needs to be laid at the feet of the\r\nfilmmakers. If this mess is what they ended up with after erring with the best\r\nintentions, I feel bad for them. If this is actually the end result they were\r\ngoing for, I\u2019d be inclined to use the legal system myself, to file an\r\ninjunction against them ever getting near a soundstage again."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Julian Schnabel: A Private Portrait", "Review": "I\u2019m not going to bore you with my own handful of personal anecdotes, so you\u2019ll have to take my word for it: The artist Julian Schnabel is the most socially gifted human being I have ever watched work a room, whether that room is a packed party or an intimate conversation space. The now-grizzled, bearish man exudes and controls a charisma that\u2019s hard to quantify. In \u201cJulian Schnabel: A Private Portrait,\u201d Schnabel keeps the personal magnetism burner at low, the better to wax reflective on his life and career in the art-crazy 1980s and beyond. Directed by Pappi Corsicato and executive produced, typically, by the subject himself, the movie is never uninteresting but is often surprisingly low-energy and, even more surprisingly, visually drab. Advertisement The movie begins with Schnabel seeming to preside, like a Prospero without the liability of exile, on one of the Li Galli islands on Italy\u2019s Amalfi coast, piggybacking a naked blond infant on his back as he walks to the sea. Stripping off his robe to reveal his once-barrel chest has shifted down to his belly, he nevertheless asserts his vitality with a high dive.\u00a0 Like Picasso before him, but without, I presume, the sadistic streak, Schnabel is an Imperial Artist, a Caesar by dint of self-proclamation and will, and yes, of talent and an incredible work ethic. In keeping with the movie\u2019s title, the story is told by friends and family. Early childhood in New York; years of acid-dropping, surfing and art-making in Brownsville, Texas; the move to New York, where he worked as a chef in a top restaurant and bounded from the kitchen on occasion to inveigle the favor of dining art dealers; controversial stardom in the 1980s; then on to the occasional but (mostly) very distinguished forays into filmmaking which gained him a whole new cachet. (He won the best director award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 for his \u201cThe Diving Bell and the Butterfly.\u201d) The interviewees are art world stalwarts such as Mary Boone and Peter Brant, also weighing in are various family members, and by the end of the film one has the impression that Schnabel has fathered something like 40 children, and also given them all jobs on his films.\u00a0 His personal expansiveness definitely keys into his work. Schnabel is a hard artist to pin down; at one point he\u2019s described as \u201ca figurative artist of great physicality\u201d but that\u2019s not quite enough to categorize him. He became notorious early in his career for \u201cplate paintings,\u201d portraits and figures painted over and around an array of cracked dishware; it\u2019s his signature style but at the same time it\u2019s only one aspect of his work. What it all has in common is being big. I suppose you could call him a maximalist, a gigantist.\u00a0 I said I wouldn\u2019t share an anecdote, but this one is not lacking in pertinence. In the early 2000s, I was to interview Christopher Walken for\u00a0Premiere\u00a0magazine. Walken\u2019s publicist wanted to book a restaurant, and I explained I wanted a quiet place because this wasn\u2019t a \u201cwhat are you up to lately?\u201d interview but rather an expansive career survey. I believe it was Walken himself who came up with the idea of doing it at his friend Julian\u2019s house/studio, a now-legendary piece of New York real estate in downtown Manhattan atop which Schnabel built a controversial (too high, said the neighbors) Venetian-style addition. (We learn in the film the origin of its name, Palazzo Chuppi.) On arriving, I went to the studio floor, a high-ceilinged loft. In one nook, Schnabel was playing with a new toy, a large-format Polaroid with a baffle that looked like an elephant\u2019s trunk, taking portraits of his pal Chris with it. The rest of the studio was taken up by these large papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculptures, three feet high or so on average; and these deliberately crude and almost Play-Doh like figures depicted scenes from Greek mythology. Taking a break from posing, Walken joined me as I looked at a scene of Agamemnon\u2019s bathtub murder. We contemplated it in silence for a bit and Walken said, \u201cYeah, but where would you\u00a0put\u00a0it?\u201d Overall, Schnabel\u2019s work is plentiful and eclectic enough that it\u2019s like the weather in certain locales\u2014if you don\u2019t like one piece of work, wait a while in the virtual slideshow, there\u2019s probably something you\u2019ll take to coming up Advertisement It\u2019s too bad Walken isn\u2019t in this film, but Willem Dafoe is, as is much of the cast of \u201cThe Diving Bell and the Butterfly,\u201d as are filmmaker friends Hector Babenco and Jean-Claude Carriere. Babenco calls Schnabel \u201ca figure from a Balzac novel,\u201d while Carriere extemporizes on what he feels to be Schnabel\u2019s essential unknowabilty. Schnabel\u2019s friendship and collaboration with Lou Reed is touched upon to moving effect (and Bono turns up for the requisite sound bite in this section). A bit of not-quite-inside-art baseball features critic/historian and Picasso biographer John Richardson, nearly 90 when depicted in the film, seen coming around on Schnabel\u2019s work. The torch is passed, sort of! Despite its \u201cprivate portrait\u201d subtitle, there are some corners the film declines to wander into (and here, perhaps, is where the subject\u2019s participation in the production came to bear). There is no mention of 2011\u2019s \u201cMiral,\u201d a Schnabel-directed movie that is not very good at all; nor is his personal involvement with that film\u2019s screenwriter. No mention is made of the fact that the toddler he carries on his back at the movie\u2019s opening has a mother who is wholly other from his second wife Olatz. Not that I\u2019m affronted or feel denied, but these kind of omissions do stand out in this context. My main complaint, as mentioned above, is that for a movie about a visual artist, it\u2019s not very good looking. The original footage looks as if it might have been captured on a color Portapak, and the film clips seem to have gotten slathered with video noise in the transfer. Back in the day, Schnabel might have arranged for his self-tribute to screen in Glorious Technicolor, Breathtaking CinemaScope, etcetera. Wonder what happened."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Shrek the Third", "Review": "\"Shrek the Third\" is a damped-down return to the\r\nKingdom of Far Far Away, lacking the comic energy of the first brilliant film\r\nand not measuring up to the second. From the thrills of dragon-slaying and\r\ndamsel-rescuing, Shrek's challenges have been reduced to a career decision:\r\nShould he become the king? The\r\nmovie is as visually enchanting as the first two in the series, and the big\r\ngreen ogre (voice of Mike Myers) is as gentle and lovable, but the movie\r\nsettles for action that it trusts is funny, instead of aiming for comedy\r\nitself. Another peculiarity is that the plot will probably not be engaging for\r\nyounger audience members, who understand dragons but don't care that uneasy\r\nlies the head that wears a crown. Shrek spends too much time in lachrymose\r\nconversation with his bride Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) and pondering the\r\nchallenge of fatherhood, and not enough time being an ogre. Advertisement Indeed,\r\nShrek is the only character in the movie who makes a big deal about his\r\nogrehood. The king and queen (voices of John Cleese and Julie Andrews) have\r\nlong since embraced their son-in-law, and on his deathbed, the frog king\r\nreveals that Shrek is an heir to the throne \u2014 one of two, including the\r\nfeckless Artie (voice of pop star Justin Timberlake). Shrek demurs, preferring\r\nlife back in the swamp in what Fiona describes as his \"vermin-filled\r\nshack.\" Why\r\nwould Fiona, raised as a princess, accept life in such a dreary mire of\r\ndespond? Recall from \"Shrek\" (2001) that she was a conventional\r\nprincess only by day, and became an ogre after nightfall. When she was rescued\r\nfrom marriage to Lord Farquaad with Shrek's kiss, she became an ogre full-time.\r\nBefore that she was a human, I guess, although her father was a frog.\r\nInter-species reproduction is so common in Far Far Away that it makes\r\nirrelevant such questions as whether Kermit and Miss Piggy ever had sex.\r\nRemember that the dragon and Donkey fell in love in the first film. For someone\r\nlike me who has never understood how birds and snakes do it, thoughts of their\r\nmarital adventures boggles the mind. Back\r\nagain this time are the two supporting stars from the earlier films, Donkey\r\n(voice of Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (voice of Antonio Banderas). But\r\nthey're reduced to being friends and traveling partners and are never really\r\nforegrounded. At one point, magically, they switch bodies and talk in each\r\nother's voices, but that's what it amounts to: They talk in each other's\r\nvoices. Such a thing is not intrinsically funny, unless it is plot or\r\ncharacter-driven. Little really depends on it or comes from it, except for a\r\nweak little sight gag at the end. Since Murphy's vocal riffs and improvisations\r\nhave been so inspired earlier in the series, we want more of him this time, not\r\nless. Shrek,\r\nFiona, Donkey and Puss have to sail to the land of Worcestershire to find\r\nArtie, and also encounter Prince Charming (voice of Rupert Everett), who is\r\nreduced from princehood to (in an opening scene) performing in dinner theater.\r\nFairly arbitrary developments produce a team of heroines (Cinderella, Snow White,\r\nSleeping Beauty) who are sort of Charlie's Angels, I guess, although they\r\nprovide the movie with too many characters and not enough for them to do. In\r\nthe first film, they were a sly Dreamworks dig at Disney and were dumped, as\r\nobsolete, in Shrek's private swamp. Advertisement Indeed,\r\nthe movie practices such economy of characters that the Gingerbread Man and the\r\nThree Blind Mice turn up again \u2014 unwanted, if you ask me. What's the use of\r\nThree Blind Mice if you can't see them run? And although I have been trained to\r\naccept talking animals, living pastries fail to engage me. I\r\nlearn from Variety that there will be a fourth \"Shrek\" and a Broadway\r\nmusical, and I hope both return for their inspiration to the original\r\n\"Shrek.\" That film did so much with the outsider status of an ogre,\r\nand Shrek's painful uncertainties about his role in non-ogre society. It\r\ninvolved intolerance and prejudice and courage, and had real stakes. And it was\r\nfunny. And had great action scenes, like Shrek's rescue of Fiona. Now everybody\r\nin the Land of Far Far Away acts as if we (and they) have seen the first two\r\nfilms. The\r\nmovie's always a pleasure to watch for its skilled animation. But it lacks\r\ntruly interesting challenges. It makes the mistake of thinking slapstick action\r\nis funny for its own sake, a mistake made by a lot of Saturday-morning TV\r\ncartoons. True, characters zooming and bouncing around are easy to write\r\nbecause no creative invention is required to set them in motion. But so what?"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "A Thousand Years of Good Prayers", "Review": "I suppose you could say that Wayne Wang is our leading Chinese-American filmmaker, but I despise descriptions like that. He's a fine filmmaker, no labels needed. I bring it up only because his new film \"A Thousand Years of Good Prayers\" is the first Wang movie since 1997 to deal with Chinese themes. His previous feature, \"Last Holiday\" (2006), was the lovable comedy starring Queen Latifah at a posh Czech spa. When I asked Wang about this hiatus in subject matter, he said: \"I'm sorry that over the last 10 years, the kinds of films that the audience likes to watch have changed, but I will continue to make these films about Chinese-Americans, and in my own way.\" And that is what he has done in \"A Thousand Years of Good Prayers.\" Advertisement The critic Todd McCarthy is correct in calling the film \"Ozu-like.\" It is an intensely observed, small-scale family drama involving disagreement between generations. A father from China arrives in America for his first visit in years with his daughter. Their values have grown apart, their lifestyles are opposite, they suppress what they're feeling. This in microcosm is Ozu's \"Tokyo Story,\" the only film I ever showed my film class that made some of them cry. Mr. Shi (Henry O) gets off his flight in San Francisco and looks around for a daughter who should be waiting for him. Yilan (Faye Yu) is a little tardy. She has not seen her father in years, yet does not kiss him. She takes him home to her antiseptic condo. As they have dinner, silences threaten to overwhelm them. He is reluctant to pry too much. She is guarded. As the film develops, he will pry more, and she will reveal some long-hidden feelings. He will begin to shop for food and cook meals, in an attempt to turn her apartment into a place that feels more like home. She will find excuses to be absent more and more. He will wander around and try to have conversations in his imperfect English. We see this corner of America through his eyes. He speaks to people he finds around the condo pool, and is surprised that they don't have to go to work. They are courteous to him, but uninterested. They have never met a \"real\" Chinese person in their lives, and so what? One day on a park bench, he strikes up a conversation with Madame (Vida Ghahremani). She is about his age, is from Iran, which she thinks of as Persia, and is living with her Iranian-American daughter. Her English is a little better than Mr. Shi's. But they speak the same language, of people who grew up in cultures that value, even venerate, the older generation. Families stayed together across the years. Parents lived at home until they died. Their children did not have \"sex lives\" until they were in an approved marriage. It was like this here in North America until two or three generations ago. It would have been unthinkable for my grandmother Anna to live in a nursing home. She lived with a son and a daughter, and her other children visited regularly, my mother every day. Advertisement The legendary Prof. Howard Higman of Boulder once described to me the difference between American and European society: We are horizontal, they are vertical. An American spreads widely into his own generation and times. A European is more conscious of his place on the family tree. Of course, consumerism and television and a laundry list of other factors are making the developing world more horizontal every day. \"A Thousand Years of Good Prayers\" has moments of truth that should have taken place years earlier. They solve almost nothing. How could they? Mr. Shi is genuinely worried about his daughter's happiness. She grows defensive, even angry, when he gives voice to his concerns. So do we all. Quit prying into my life. You don't understand. This is my life and it's none of your business. \"But I'm only trying to help.\" I don't need any help. I know what I'm doing. Leave me alone. In observing the reality of this relationship, Wang contemplates the \"generation gap\" in modern societies all over the world. His film quietly, carefully, movingly observes how these two people of the same blood will never be able to understand each other, and the younger one won't even care to. The term \"generation gap\" was not used until the 1960s. It hasn't been very helpful.  As Wordsworth wrote: The world is too much with us; late and soon\rGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers\rLittle we see in Nature that is ours\rWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Pretty One", "Review": "Zoe Kazan breathes fresh, exciting life into a tried-and-true high concept, playing opposite herself as twentysomething identical twins in \"The Pretty One.\" Actually, if we stop and count, she's playing four incarnations of the same couple of characters.  We first see her as the frumpy but sweetly na\u00efve Laurel, who never left her family's rural California home. She stuck around after her mother's death to look after her melancholy father (John Carroll Lynch), even creepily going so far as to wear her mom's old-fashioned dresses. Kazan also plays Laurel's twin sister, Audrey, the stylish and sophisticated \"pretty one\" of the film's title. Audrey took off long ago, lives in the city and works at a boutique real estate agency. Advertisement But eventually a twist of fate occurs, and Kazan also ends up playing Laurel pretending to be Audrey, in a sort of heightened version of the vapid party girl's personality. And ultimately, she plays the best version of Laurel as herself; she's blossomed, she's radiant, but she's maintained her core sense of decency. It's a lot to ask of one actress and it's a tricky feat to pull off; Kazan, with her bitty voice and big eyes, manages both the girlishness and the confidence of the Laurel/Audrey conundrum charmingly.\u00a0 Writer-director Jenee LaMarque also tries to pull off a tricky feat by melding several different tones in this part romantic comedy/part coming-of-age drama. While she doesn't always hit the mark exactly, she at least shows great ambition, and she draws some lovely moments from her actors. It's the twins' birthday at the film's start. Laurel has just lost her virginity, finally, and is enjoying a newfound rush of womanhood\u2014that is, until Audrey swoops in and steals the spotlight, as usual, at their shared celebration. (The visual effects when Kazan is playing opposite herself are pretty seamless. They're also a great reminder of what a big difference a little eyeliner can make.) Later, when the sisters are on their way back home from a trip into town, they get into a major accident in the family pickup truck that leaves Audrey dead and Laurel in the hospital with temporary amnesia. (Not a spoiler, folks\u2014this happens pretty early.) Yes, this is a plot device, as is the fact that Laurel just got a sleek haircut which happens to make her look exactly like Audrey. (As is the fact that they were such strikingly polar opposites to begin with, come to think of it.) Their resemblance is so great that the doctors and nurses believe Laurel's the one who died and Audrey's the one who lived. Even their own grieving father is fooled, and Laurel is just mixed up enough that at first even she's not sure who she is. Advertisement After Laurel undergoes the surreal experience of attending her own funeral\u2014where she hears barely a kind word about herself in eulogy\u2014she decides to take over Audrey's life, move into her apartment and assume her work responsibilities. She doesn't know that Audrey's life included a married boyfriend (Ron Livingston in a half-baked subplot) and a slacker tenant in the other half of her duplex (Jake Johnson). Naturally, since Audrey hated the slacker, Laurel hits it off with him instantly. From this ghoulish premise, LaMarque tries to wrest something light and lovely. The scenes between Kazan and Johnson feature an effortless kind of banter; between this and \"Drinking Buddies\", Johnson is increasingly revealing himself as an adorably sardonic romantic lead. And Kazan continues to assert her versatility and her intriguing screen presence, a mix of twee hipster and Kewpie-doll silent film star. So you wish the material were more consistent for these two. Some moments are screechy, others aren't deeply emotional enough. The in-between moments in which LaMarque hits just the right note can be charming, though, and they promise better things to come."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", "Review": "\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\" Say it aloud. The very title causes the pulse to quicken, if you, like me, are a lover of pulp fiction. What I want is goofy action--lots of it. I want man-eating ants, swordfights between two people balanced on the backs of speeding jeeps, subterranean caverns of gold, vicious femme fatales, plunges down three waterfalls in a row, and the explanation for flying saucers. And throw in lots of monkeys. The Indiana Jones movies were directed by Steven Spielberg and written by George Lucas and a small army of screenwriters, but they exist in a universe of their own. Hell, they created it. All you can do is compare one to the other three. And even then, what will it get you? If you eat four pounds of sausage, how do you choose which pound tasted the best? Well, the first one, of course, and then there's a steady drop-off of interest. That's why no Indy adventure can match \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981). But if \"Crystal Skull\" (or \"Temple of Doom\" from 1984 or \"Last Crusade\" from, 1989) had come first in the series, who knows how much fresher it might have seemed? True, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" stands alone as an action masterpiece, but after that the series is  compelled  to be, in the words of Indiana himself, \"same old same old.\" Yes, but that's what I want  it to be. Advertisement \"Crystal Skull\" even dusts off the Russians, so severely under-exploited in recent years, as the bad guys. Up against them, Indiana Jones is once again played by Harrison Ford, who is now 65 but looks a lot like he did at 55 or 46, which is how old he was when he made \"Last Crusade.\" He has one of those Robert Mitchum faces that doesn't age, it only frowns more. He and his sidekick Mac McHale (Ray Winstone) are taken by the cool, contemptuous Soviet uber-villainess Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) to a cavernous warehouse to seek out a crate he saw there years ago. The contents of the crate are hyper-magnetic (lord, I love this stuff) and betray themselves when Indy throws a handful of gunpowder into the air. In ways too labyrinthine to describe, the crate leads Indy, Mac, Irina and the Russians far up the Amazon. Along the way they've gathered Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Indy's girlfriend from the first film, and a young biker named Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf), who is always combing his ducktail haircut. They also acquire Professor Oxley (John Hurt), elderly colleague from the University of Chicago, whose function is to read all the necessary languages, know all the necessary background, and explain everything. What happens in South America is explained by the need to create (1) sensational chase sequences, and (2) awe-inspiring spectacles. We get such sights as two dueling Jeep-like vehicles racing down parallel roads. Not many of the audience members will be as logical as I am, and wonder who went to the trouble of building  parallel roads in a rain forest. Most of the major characters eventually find themselves at the wheels of both vehicles; they leap or are thrown from one to another, and the vehicles occasionally leap right over one another. And that Irina, she's something. Her Russian backups are mostly just atmosphere, useful for pointing their rifles at Indy, but she can fight shoot, fence, drive, leap and kick, and keep on all night. Advertisement All leads to the discovery of a subterranean chamber beneath an ancient pyramid, where they find an ancient city made of gold and containing...but wait, I forgot to tell you they found a crystal skull in a crypt. Well sir, it's one of 13 crystal skulls, and the other 12 are in that chamber. When the set is complete, amazing events take place. Prof. Oxley carries the 13th skull for most of the time, and finds it repels man-eating ants. It also represents one-thirteenth of all knowledge about everything, leading Irina to utter the orgasmic words, \"I want...to  know!\"  In appearance, the skull is a cross between the aliens of the Special Edition of Spielberg's \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and the hood ornaments of 1950s Pontiacs. What is the function of the chamber? \"It's a portal--to another dimension!\" Oxley says. Indy is sensible: \"I don't think we wanna go that way.\" It is astonishing that the protagonists aren't all killed 20 or 30 times, although Irnia will become The Women Who Knew Too Much. At his advanced age, Prof.Oxley tirelessly jumps between vehicles, survives fire and flood and falling from great heights, and would win on \"American Gladiator.\" Relationships between certain other characters are of interest, since (a) the odds against them finding themselves together are astronomical, and (b) the odds against them  not  finding themselves together in this film are incalculable. Now what else can I tell you, apart from mentioning the blinking red digital countdown, and the moving red line tracing a journey on a map? I can say that if you liked the other Indiana Jones movies, you will like this one, and that if you did not, there is no talking to you. And I can also say that a critic trying to place it into a hierarchy with the others would probably keep a straight face while recommending the second pound of sausage.  \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is in the Great Movies Collection at rogerebert.com  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Titanic [3D]", "Review": "The new 3D version of \"Titanic,\" like the original 1997 version, is a magnificent motion picture. The hour or more after the ship hits the iceberg remains spellbinding. The material leading up to that point is a combination of documentary footage from the ocean floor, romantic melodrama, and narration by a centenarian named Rose. The production brings to life the opulence of the great iron ship. Its passengers are a cross section of way of life that would be ended forever by the First World War. In a way, the iceberg represented the 20th century. Advertisement James Cameron's film is not perfect. It has some flaws, but I hate the way film critics employ that word \"flaw,\" as if they are jewelers with loupes screwed into their eye sockets, performing a valuation. We can say there are elements that could have been handled differently. We can begin with some elements that are superb just as they stand. To begin with, Cameron avoids the pitfalls of telling a story about which \"everybody knows the ending.\" Yes, the Titanic strikes an iceberg and sinks. That isn't the story he tells. He uses that as a backdrop for stories about hubris, greed, class conflict, romance and a misplaced faith in technology. The Titanic was doomed the moment it was described as \"unsinkable.\" There is a chilling conversation on the bridge between Bruce Ismay, the ship's owner, and Thomas Andrews, its architect. Ismay: \"But this ship can't sink!\" Andrews: \"She's made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is a mathematical certainty.\" Its unsinkability perhaps explains why Capt. Edward John Smith (Bernard Hill), despite being warned of icebergs, cranked the ship up to its top velocity and left it speeding blindly through the night. Would the captain of any other vessel have felt confident in doing that? In another sense, many of those on board thought of themselves as unsinkable, including the millionaires Benjamin Guggenheim (Michael Ensign) and the fictional villain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Guggenheim called for a brandy and went down with the ship. Hockley would have thrown women and children overboard to preserve himself. Also on board was the Denver millionaire Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), who survived and is known to history as the Unsinkable Molly Brown. She's shown as one of the few arguing that her lifeboat turn back to rescue passengers freezing to death in the icy water. Here already I have fallen prey to Cameron's storytelling, and have become distracted from the ship's fate by the fates of those on board. Of greatest interest to us are Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), who is engaged to the snaky Caledon Hockley, and Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a steerage passenger who falls in love with her onboard and saves her life. She is the same Rose, known now as \"Rose Dawson,\" who is the old lady, the sole living survivor, brought on board a salvage vessel near the beginning of the film (she's played by Gloria Stuart, who was 86 when the film was made, and topped 100 before she died in 2010). This elderly woman, with such spirit and old, wise eyes, provides \"Titanic\" with what seems impossible: A happy ending. It is happy for her, at least, because she finds closure with the recovery of a drawing made by Jack and a final scene involving a famous diamond. Advertisement The Roses, young and old, provide a through-line from the day the ship set sail until the present day. She creates the psychological illusion that she's the heroine throughout, rescuing the film from a chronological timeline and providing an eyewitness for the crew on the salvage and exploration vessel. Cameron uses her as his excuse for an invaluable narrative device. He has the underwater explorers show her a little animated film that will \"explain\" to her how the ship sank, but actually explains it to us. This device is used all the time as a chalk talk or imaginary sequence in which the mastermind of a bank heist or prison escape explains the plan to those who will use it; he's really explaining it to us, so we'll understand it when we see it. As if there's not suspense enough when the ship is sinking, we're all the time wondering when it will break in half. Cameron is also not slow to bring the architect Andrews up to the bridge, so he can unroll his blueprints and explain to Captain Smith (and us) how the rushing flood waters will flow over one bulwark after the next. The class differences onboard become a matter of life and death. The lifeboats are reserved for first class passengers, and those in steerage are locked below behind sliding gates. Crew members enforce these distinctions, sometimes at gunpoint; so loyal are they to their employers that, even though they're going to die, they feel no sympathy for their lower-class comrades. In an early scene, it is by sneaking up to the first class deck that Jack saves Rose from jumping off the ship. She has decided she prefers death to a life among affluent snobs like her fianc\u00e9e; this shows she has more principle than imagination. Jack becomes the hero only because he flouts all class distinctions, a decision that has its roots deep in 19th century melodrama. All of these matters take place in a ship created by art design, set construction, modeling, animation and miniatures which are state of the art. James Cameron's films have always been distinguished by ground-breaking technical excellence. Now to those \"flaws.\" Both of them involve the behavior of characters. There are several scenes involving Jack trying to help Rose escape the sinking ship, and then Rose helping free Jack after he's handcuffed to a pipe in a cabin, and then Jack again helping them to escape. Consider Rose. Of her own volition, she leaves the safety of a lifeboat and dashes back into the bowels of the ship to find Jack. She wades through water up to her waist, slugs an unhelpful crew member on the jaw, finds Jack, and then finds a fire ax to break the chain of his handcuffs. Advertisement Plucky, yes? But in all their other escape scenes, Jack pulls her behind him while desperately shouting Rose! Up here! Rose! Down there! Rose! Follow me! et cetera. This grows monotonous and tiresome. It reminds me of one of the early definitions in Ebert's Little Movie Glossary, the \"Me Push-Pull You.\" That's an adaptation of a friend of Doctor Dolittle's, the \"Pushmi-pullyu.\" I define it as a male who treats a woman as a wee helpless creature who cannot save herself but must be pushed and pulled. Given Rose's behavior in finding her way through the flooding ship while saving Jack, she seems capable enough to be allowed the occasional Jack! Up here! (There is also the inconvenience that Rose and anyone else wading through the ice-cold water should quickly be dead of hypothermia.) Another character I have questions about is Spicer Lovejoy, Caledon Hockley's pistol-packing bodyguard and dirty tricks man. Played by the superb actor David Warner, Lovejoy is a poker-faced tough guy entirely at the disposal of his boss. In the ship's desperate final moments, he is always at Hockley's side with helpful information, such as that a lifeboat on the other side of the ship is allowing men on board. Lovejoy is invaluable to the screenplay, because he gives Hockley someone to speak and plot with. Otherwise the dastard would be reduced to dashing about madly on his own. Nevertheless, whatever Spicer is being paid is not enough. Now for the final flaw. It is, of course, the 3D process. Cameron has justly been praised for being one of the few directors to use 3D usefully, in \"Avatar.\" But \"Titanic\" was not shot for 3D, and just as you cannot gild a pig, you cannot make 2D into 3D. What you can do, and he tries to do it well, is find certain scenes that you can present as having planes of focus in foreground, middle and distance. So what? Did you miss any dimensions the first time you saw \"Titanic?\" No matter how long Cameron took to do it, no matter how much he spent, this is retrofitted 2D. Case closed. Advertisement But not quite. There's more to it than that. 3D causes a noticeable loss in the brightness coming from the screen. Some say as much as 20 percent. If you saw an ordinary film dimmed that much, you might complain to the management. Here you're supposed to be grateful you had the opportunity to pay a surcharge for this defacement. If you're alert to it, you'll notice that many shots and sequences in this version are not in 3D at all, but remain in 2D. If you take off your glasses, they'll pop off the screen with dramatically improved brightness. I know why the film is in 3D. It's to justify the extra charge. That's a shabby way to treat a masterpiece."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Everly", "Review": "Nothing like a trashy, all-hell-breaks-loose onslaught of blood, bullets and babes that borrows inspiration from a recycling bin stuffed with leftovers from \u201860s grindhouse films, Japanese horror, \u201cKill Bill,\u201d \u201cSaw\u201d and splatter-fest videogames to cleanse one\u2019s visual palate of those highbrow Oscar contenders. In \u201cEverly,\u201d Salma Hayek throws herself with admirable abandon into the role of an avenging victim of sex slavery held against her will for years in a luxury high-rise apartment by misogynistic Asian mobsters. She exhibits such fire-breathing ferocity, it is hard to know whether this excessively cruel exercise in ultra-violence is exploiting her or she is exploiting it. Lord knows, she is by far the best thing about it. Advertisement The one-time Best Actress nominee for the splendid 2002 biopic \u201cFrida\u201d turned second-string player opposite Adam Sandler in those wretched \u201cGrown Ups\u201d comedies appears to have re-embraced her B-movie action roots. She hasn\u2019t been such a red-hot pistol since the days of \u201cDesperado\u201d and \u201cFrom Dusk Till Dawn,\u201d and if the film does anything right, it reminds us that now-48-year-old Hayek is one heck of a forceful presence when she is allowed to be. \n As they once said of Foxy Brown, her Everly is a whole lot of woman. Too bad \u201cEverly\u201d itself is not exactly a whole lot of movie. What could have been a female-charged adrenaline rush is too hung up on queasy brutality and too quick to rely on a side plot involving Everly\u2019s estranged mother and the toddler daughter she barely has gotten to know as a kind of counter-balance to the over-the-top nastiness. Director Joe Lynch (\u201cKnights of Badassdom,\u201d \u201cWrong Turn 2: Dead End\u201d) and writer Yale Hannon shamelessly borrow not just the contained space concept from the Bruce Willis classic \"Die Hard\" but also make ironic use of a Christmas setting\u2014all the better to blare jazzy renditions of holiday tunes on the soundtrack while madness and mayhem messily deck the walls along with the halls.\u00a0 \u201cEverly\u201d wastes no time going into carnage overdrive with at least 20 killings in the first 20 minutes. In a stylish overhead shot, we witness Hayek, naked save for the ornate Japanese tattoo on her back, dig out a pistol and a phone stashed in her toilet tank and don a skimpy slip from her dirty laundry hamper. She begins to systematically shoot the thugs lurking about that have been presumably beating and gang-raping her minutes before (we only hear her agonizing screams while the screen remains black). Everly also takes a bullet to the gut during the relentless gunfire, and the resulting holes are only slightly worse than those that riddle the script. Advertisement In between arranging to keep her mother and her cutie-pie daughter safe from harm and trying to contact a detective who promised to help her, she ends up having to single-handedly fend off a series of trained killers and prostitute assassins in fetishized costumes that pour forth from other apartments in the makeshift brothel. They come and go through Everly\u2019s door like critters in a whack-a-mole game after being alerted that a bounty has been placed on her head.\u00a0 A period of relative silence follows so certain plot details can be elaborated upon and for one dead body to briefly revive to provide Hayek with some human interaction. Everly is able to keep an eye on activity in the building via a video monitor and eventually realizes there is no escape while ever more threatening visitors arrive. Of particular note is a vicious attack dog named Bonzai who learns the hard way that grenades are not to be toyed with and the Sadist, a cravat-wearing creep who brings along a half-naked masochist locked in a cage.\u00a0 It would take a Quentin Tarantino or maybe a Luc Besson to be able to smoothly blend such gruesome doings (the increasingly outlandish array of weaponry, from samurai swords to rocket launchers, is rather impressive if you are into such things) with scenes of matriarchal love and devotion. But Lynch and his writer are more adept at oozing guts than heartfelt emotion. And given the not-exactly-conducive circumstances, Hayek\u2019s sexual charisma more or less goes untapped save for her body-clinging apparel (she eventually dons a low-cut tank top and yoga pants). Odd how there are two current films in theaters about women being punished and abused for the benefit of men. Unlike \u201cFifty Shades of Grey,\u201d however, \u201cEverly\u201d does not romanticize its intentions. It even allows room for a brief flicker of female dignity. When one of the bad guys taunting Everly looks around at the dead bodies littering her place and dismissively sneers, \"That's a lot of dead whores,\" she angrily retorts, \"You don't get to call them that.\" And that is as close to enlightenment as \u201cEverly\u201d gets.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Family Fang", "Review": "There\u2019s something I\u2019ve noticed in a couple indie pictures\r\nlately, and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s a trick that competent editors suggest to\r\ngive a little oomph to movies. I\u2019ll call it The Unnecessary In Medias Res. The movie will open on a\r\nscene of relative zippiness or suspense, ending on what\u2019s meant\r\nto be a suggestive indeterminate note. Then a title will come on screen: \u201c24\r\nHours Before,\u201d \u201cTwo Weeks Ago,\u201d \u201cThree Months Ago,\u201d or some such thing. The\r\nfilm will then go on, telling its narrative, and eventually it will catch up\r\nwith the scene that began it. What\r\nwill follow will make sense not just in the context of the larger plot but\r\nsatisfy the viewer as to why the scene was put at the beginning of the movie,\r\nout of sequence, in the first place. BUT, in less accomplished movies, the\r\nviewer is left asking, why\u2019d all this have to be in flashback? Advertisement This year I saw the device used with almost comic\r\nblatancy in the worthless thriller \u201cMisconduct.\u201d And it pops up again here in \"The Family Fang,\" and\r\nproves completely unnecessary. The movie opens with a sequence made to look as\r\nif it was shot on video tape, a documentary of a little kid holding up a bank\r\nin the 1970s. There\u2019s a twist, and it has to do with the very nature of the\r\nfamily cited in the title, and that twist is the first and really only\r\neffective bit of manipulation in the entire film. The \u201carchive\u201d footage would\r\nhave made a pretty compelling opening to the movie in and of itself. Instead,\r\nthe movie then cuts to a depressed-looking Nicole Kidman in a dark room\r\nwatching the footage on television, popping out the cassette, and leaving the\r\nroom, as the camera pans to a corkboard festooned with maps and news articles\r\nabout the disappearance of a pair of once-prominent conceptual and performance\r\nartists. And then \u2026 flashback time.  Directed by co-star Jason Bateman, from a script by David\r\nLindsay-Abaire, based on a novel by Kevin Wilson, \u201cThe Family Fang\u201d is largely\r\nnoteworthy for the specific place it locates generational resentment. Bateman\r\nand Kidman play siblings, advanced adults no longer living up to their early\r\npromise. Once a Guy-In-Your-MFA tyro novelist, Bateman\u2019s Baxter is now years\r\npast the deadline for his next book. Kidman\u2019s Annie, an actress, has drunk her\r\nway out of a recurring role in a lucrative superhero franchise and is reduced\r\nto being wheedled into nude scenes by abusive directors of lame indies. Where\r\nis the locus of their dysfunction? Of course, in the larger family unit: their\r\nparents, Caleb and Camille, performance/conceptual artists of the \u201860s and \u201870s\r\nwho forced their kids\u2014whom Caleb initially referred to merely as \u201cChild A\u201d and \u201cChild\r\nB\u201d\u2014to participate in stunt-like pieces. Many of which are recreated in further\r\nflashbacks.  There\u2019s an interesting reactionary quality in the way the\r\nmovie makes conceptual art its straw man, standing in for Irresponsible\r\nParenting By The Counterculture. I don\u2019t know if the Revenge Of Gen X And Or Y\r\nsubtext was very strong in Wilson\u2019s novel (I can hazard a guess though, that\r\nwhen he was writing it, he probably envisioned Wes Anderson as the Dream Director for the film adaptation), but here it flounders just like every other\r\naspect of the movie, including the \u201cwhat really happened\u201d plot thread of Caleb\r\nand Camille\u2019s disappearance shortly after they rudely reintroduce themselves\r\ninto their children\u2019s lives.\u00a0 Advertisement While\r\nthe cast keeps its head down and reaches for genuine emotion, the movie\r\neventually manages to sentimentalize even what it sees as its own\r\ntough-mindedness. The major exception, and the reason I\u2019m rating this movie\r\nhigher than I would otherwise, is Christopher Walken. His commitment to making Caleb as thoroughly\r\nunlikable as humanly possible yields a character who\u2019s kind of terrifyingly\r\noff-putting even when his words and actions are ineffectual. A piece of acting\r\nalchemy of which only few are capable. I can\u2019t imagine how powerful it might\r\nhave been in a better movie."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Camp X-Ray", "Review": "\u201cCamp X-Ray\u201d has cinematic and moral intelligence. This\r\ndebut feature by writer-director Peter Sattler about a female soldier stationed\r\nat Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is a quiet, patient drama that focuses on a handful of\r\ncharacters and plays out in a few key locations: a cell, a hallway, a\r\nprison yard, some offices. It articulates its observations and emotions through\r\nshots and cuts, and actors\u2019 reactions. It\u2019s also about culture clashes,\r\npatriotism, idealism, duty, and what it means to be a woman in a job defined by\r\nprimordial ideas of manhood. It is not a perfect movie\u2014a couple of developments\r\nfeel shoehorned in, and the final leg squanders the goodwill built up in the\r\npreceding 90 minutes\u2014but it\u2019s ambitious, and it has soul. It\u2019s one of the better\r\nmainstream American film portraits of what happened to America's psyche\r\nafter 9/11: the moral numbness that set in right away, and never entirely\r\nlifted. Advertisement \u201cTwilight\u201d star Kristen Stewart carries the film on her\r\nslender shoulders. She plays the heroine, PFC Amy Cole, a young woman from a Florida\r\ntown who enlisted in the Army to learn and grow, but now finds herself at\r\nGuantanamo\u2014also as Gitmo, or Camp X-Ray\u2014watching over prisoners. Sorry: detainees. It\u2019s important to use that\r\nword instead of \u201cprisoners\u201d because, as Amy explains to a fellow soldier,\r\n\u201cPrisoners are subject to the Geneva Conventions. Detainees are not.\u201d  Amy\u2019s trainer, CPL Randy Randsell (Lane Garrison), tells her\r\nright off the bat that it\u2019s not a good idea to see the detainees as autonomous\r\nhuman beings, because that will get in the way of the job. He discourages her partly\r\nby playing on her insecurity as one of a handful of women at Camp X-Ray, a camp\r\nstaffed mostly by burly male soldiers guarding cell blocks full of fundamentalist\r\nMuslims who don\u2019t like being overseen by Americans generally, American women in\r\nparticular.  Amy disregards Randy\u2019s instructions and lets a stridently\r\neloquent, English-speaking inmate named Amir Ali (Peyman Moaadi of \u201cA\r\nSeparation\u201d) engage her in conversation as she rolls a book cart up and down\r\nthe cell block hallway. The relationship between Amy, a strong-silent type, and\r\nAli, a chatterbox provocateur, has a \u201870s-movie feel. The filmmaker lets\r\nStewart act Steve McQueen-style, mostly with her eyes, body and hands. Moaadi\r\njabbers and squirms and wheedles like a Middle Eastern cousin of Dustin\r\nHoffman. Their first talk is faintly Kafka-esque: he\u2019s read the first six\r\nHarry Potter books and has been begging for the seventh volume for two years.\r\nAmy can\u2019t and won\u2019t help him, offering him a two-week-old newspaper plus\r\nwhatever else is on the cart. Their conversations about reading material do\r\nsuch a subtle job of exploring the film\u2019s themes (they talk about Willa\r\nCather\u2019s \u201cMy Antonia,\u201d a book built around a female pioneer, as well as Harry Potter) that it\u2019s a huge letdown when the films\r\npays these conversations off in a boringly conventional way. Far better are the journalistic details: the magazines and\r\nnewspapers on Amy\u2019s book cart, with women\u2019s faces blacked out; the way inmates\r\nwrap their Korans in small white blankets, and pass the time by drawing, doing\r\npuzzles, yelling at the guards and each other, and occasionally hurling feces\r\nin protest; the way that procedure, protocol and tradition rule everything, on\r\nboth sides of the cell doors.  The first half of \u201cCamp X-Ray\u201d concentrates on showing us what\r\nit\u2019s like to be Amy and do Amy\u2019s job. Sattler often photographs her in ways\r\nthat either disguise her femininity or complicate our reactions to it. The first\r\ntime we see her, she\u2019s silhouetted against the sun, backlit like a Clint Eastwood gunfighter. As the story unfolds, there\r\nare many close-ups taken from behind Stewart\u2019s shoulders as Amy walks through the\r\ncamp or down a cell block corridor, or sits in a chair in the mess hall or in\r\nher apartment, thinking. Our eye naturally gravitates toward her hair, which is\r\npulled into a tight bun. The bun is at the center of the frame during so many\r\nimportant scenes that it eventually seems to stand for both Amy\u2019s tightly wound\r\npersonality and her workplace predicament. She gets flack for being sexually\r\nunavailable to men, but at the same time, she\u2019s under pressure to \u201cman up\u201d and\r\nnot show her feelings, because that\u2019s what girls do. (Amy only lets her hair down once in the film, before Skyping\r\nwith her mom.) \u201cAre you a soldier, or are you a female soldier?\u201d Randy asks\r\nAmy, when she recoils from an inmate\u2019s humiliation-as-punishment. \u201c\u2019Cuz I don\u2019t\r\nhave these kind of problems with soldiers.\u201d  Advertisement Stewart is great in \u201cCamp X-Ray.\u201d Freed of her \u201cTwilight\u201d\r\nobligation to enact a horror movie version of fairytale-femme situations, she\r\nseems at ease (so to speak) as a tomboy. She mines a narrow emotional range with\r\nprecision. Her performance is fat-free. There are silent film-quality close-ups\r\nwhere you can read every fluctuation in her mood even though she\u2019s\r\nbarely moving a muscle. This is a true movie star performance. When it fails to convince, it\u2019s only because Stewart\u2019s acting\r\nmakes the heroine seem like such a distinct, real person that when Amy talks or acts like a standard\r\nconscience-stricken movie character, we can\u2019t accept it. \u201cCamp X-Ray\u201d spirals\r\ninto conventional dramatics near the end, rushing through Amy\u2019s\r\nepiphany and Ali\u2019s despair, and turning into the hard-edged yet sentimental buddy\r\nfilm you hoped it was too proud to let itself be. But it\u2019s still worth\r\nseeing for the caliber of its acting and filmmaking. Sattler and his\r\ncinematographer, James Laxton, compose striking shots that advance the story\r\nand comment on the script\u2019s themes without becoming ostentatiously pretty. The\r\nmovie makes great use of the camp\u2019s coldly anonymous architecture, framing\r\nguards and prisoners within rectangles and squares and converging diagonal\r\nlines, and sometimes dwarfing them in long shots that have the geometric\r\nsolidity of a Piet Mondrian painting. The editing, by Geraud Brisson, juxtaposes\r\nshots in cheeky ways, as when the movie crosscuts between a Muslim call to\r\nprayer and soldiers lining up for morning inspection: the sequence is capped by\r\na shot of the the US flag flapping in the breeze, as if to suggest that blind\r\nfaith in a nation's goodness is its own kind of state religion."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "As I Open My Eyes", "Review": "American filmgoers who see new French films in movie\r\ntheaters often encounter movies made by well-known directors and featuring\r\nestablished stars. Critics who experience the abundant offerings at\r\ninternational film festivals, though, often see another kind of French film:\r\nfirst features by young directors who mount loosely autobiographical\r\ncoming-of-age tales in a briskly naturalistic style. There are three intertwined reasons why these films are so\r\nnumerous and so similar to each other. One is that, by all appearances, a chunk\r\nof the young French population feels it\u2019s their birthright as citizens of the\r\nRepublic to make a movie, and what better subject than the obvious: one\u2019s own\r\nyouth. The second is that the Republic apparently agrees with this belief, and\r\nheavily funds movies that represent \u201cyoung cinema.\u201d The third reason is that\r\nproducers desirous of government munificence\u2014and of helping young talent, of\r\ncourse\u2014gladly rally to the task of mounting such fledgling efforts. Advertisement The fact that France is the capital of auteur theory additionally\r\nmeans that these producers rarely have much creative input or control over the\r\nfilms. It\u2019s all about the vision of the young filmmaker, and that freedom,\r\ntogether with the propensity for autobiographical tales, is why so many of\r\nthese films feel stamped from the same mold. Leyla Bouzid\u2019s \u201cAs I Open My Eyes\u201d is one of this very\r\nfamiliar type, but there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s one of the few examples headed\r\ninto America cinemas. That\u2019s because it was made by a young Arab woman and\r\nreflects on her experiences in Tunisia during the lead-up to the Arab Spring\u2014or\r\nJasmine Revolution, is it was called there. This political/cultural dimension is indeed interesting and\r\nnoteworthy, but the way it\u2019s presented here makes \u201cAs I Open My Eyes\u201d feel like\r\ntwo films rather oddly stitched together. For much of its length, it\u2019s a\r\ncoming-of-age tale that has Tunisian characters but feels like the standard\r\nFrench type (Bouzid studied filmmaking in Paris and French literature at the\r\nSorbonne). Then, in the last act, political paranoia and revolutionary ferment\r\nburst into the story, and a different sort of film emerges. Bouzid centers her story on 18-year-old Farah (Baya\r\nMedhaffer), a middle-class girl torn between her mother and her boyfriend and\r\nthe two life paths they represent. Hayet (Ghalia Benali), her mom, is a kindly\r\nbut very practical sort, and she\u2019s understandably thrilled that her daughter\u2019s\r\nbeen accepted to medical school. Farah, though, sings in a band\u2014one of Patti\r\nSmith\u2019s album covers hangs in her bedroom\u2014and that\u2019s the more romantic road\r\nassociated with her boyfriend Bohr\u00e8ne (Montassar Ayari). Advertisement Not surprisingly, Farah devotes more time to her band and\r\nBohr\u00e8ne than to mom. The band (which performs songs by Iraqi musician Khyam\r\nAllami) seems off to a strong start, and the same might said of Farah\u2019s first\r\nbig romance. The passion is new and obviously exhilarating. After making love,\r\nshe kicks the sheet off Bohr\u00e8ne, saying she wants to see what a man\u2019s penis\r\nlooks like. (One wonders if this scene could be shown in Tunisia, or if it\r\nindicates the extent to which the film is meant for foreign viewers.) Curiously, there\u2019s virtually no mention of religion in the\r\nfilm. For that matter, politics creep into the tale only obliquely, and later.\r\nIt appears we\u2019re meant to understand that the band\u2019s music and Farah\u2019s lyrics\r\nhave an edge of protest, but this is registered only as a very general sort of\r\nfrustration and discontent.  This reviewer was in Tunisia during the time the film\r\ndepicts and remembers the repressive atmosphere and sense of omnipresent\r\nsurveillance prior to the popular uprising and the flight of the dictator Ben\r\nAli. Again, though, there\u2019s practically no discussion of politics anywhere in\r\nthe film. This element enters the story only in the last act, when the band\r\nbegins to think that one of its members is a police informant, and then Farah\r\ndisappears into the Kafkaesque grip of the state security apparatus. The latter event occasions the film\u2019s two strongest scenes.\r\nIn one, Farah\u2019s mom takes her to a crowded bus station and manages to buy her\r\nthe last ticket on an inter-city bus, but then Farah\u2019s goes off to buy a drink\r\nand never returns. The mother\u2019s frantic search through the station for her\r\nmissing child has a pulse of Hitchcockian dread. The other scene, which comes\r\nsoon after, shows Farah\u2019s interrogation by two policemen. It\u2019s done in a single\r\ntake and is harrowing enough for a Costa-Gavras film. These scenes show that Bouzid has real filmmaking talent, as\r\ndo the strong performances she gets out of newcomer Medhaffer as Farah and\r\nBenali as her mother. When these two are in top form at the story\u2019s climax, it\r\nmakes you wish a strong producer had induced Bouzid to toss the coming-of-age\r\nclich\u00e9s and focus the entire film on the nascent political drama that makes its\r\nlatter third so much more compelling than the rest.

{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Dark Skies", "Review": "If the sci-fi/horror hybrid \"Dark Skies\" had been an hour-long episode of a television anthology series like \"The Twilight Zone,\" it might have gone down as a thoroughly average installment that handled the familiar elements in a reasonably skillful manner. In extending itself to reach a conventional feature length, however, it becomes a below-average programmer in which brief moments of interest are interrupted by long stretches of boredom. It eventually ends abruptly, as if designed specifically to enrage the hardy viewers who actually make it all the way to the end. Advertisement Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton play Lacy and Daniel Barrett, an Arizona couple with two sons and money woes \u2014 he is out of work and she is a real-estate agent charged with unloading a house so ugly that even the folks on HGTV's Curb Appeal would find it too much of a challenge. In other words, they have enough problems on their hands even before Lacy wakes up in the middle of the night and discovers that something has raided the refrigerator before disappearing into the dark. There are other inexplicable occurrences \u2014 including more food-related weirdness and no fewer than three flocks of birds messily slamming into the house at the same time \u2014 and at first, most of them seem to be revolving around younger son Sam (Kadan Rockett), who claims that \"The Sandman\" is visiting him in his dreams. When the rest of the family begins to experience the inexplicable \u2014 trances, seizures, mysterious bloody noses and bruises \u2014 they become neighborhood pariahs.  Eventually, they come across eminent Internet crackpot Edwin Allard (J.K. Simmons) and he informs him that they are being tormented by aliens who are experimenting with them as a scientist might use a lab rat. According to him, \"The Greys,\" as he calls them, have been hiding amongst us for a long time and that their recently escalating aggression suggests that they may be preparing to kidnap one of the family. Assuming that Sam is the ultimate target, the Barretts barricade themselves inside their home for a final standoff in which they attempt to fend off the invaders with shotguns and a guard dog. Perhaps not surprisingly, things do not go quite as planned. Even viewers with only a passing knowledge of the genres that \"Dark Skies\" is playing with will quickly realize that it is little more than a compilation of elements taken from other and usually better films. The basic plot is pretty much a direct rip-off of the classic suburban ghost story \"Poltergeist\" (1982), and there are also elements obviously poached from the likes of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1956 and 1978), \"Signs\" (2002), \"Paranormal Activity\" (2007) and countless other titles. Maybe at some sci-fi convention one day, fanboys can go through it shot-by-shot and call out the name of every movie from which it borrows, as a way of passing time before the \"Inspector Spacetime\" panel. Advertisement To be fair, \"Dark Skies\" does have a few things going for it. Writer-director Scott Stewart, whose previous efforts have included the inexcusably stupid genre mash-ups \"Legion\" and \"Priest\" (2011), takes a slow-burn approach to the proceedings that is effective in setting the oddball mood. As the beleaguered mother, Keri Russell delivers a strong performances that is actually far better and more committed than one might expect from this kind of movie and makes you wish that she got more chances to work on the big screen. And even though he is only in a couple of scenes, the brief presence of the invaluable J.K. Simmons comes as a blessed relief. After all, if you have to have a scene in which all the weird goings-on are explained in one giant gob of goofy exposition, it is always wise to have it delivered by an actor with the ability to make even the silliest of developments come across as borderline plausible. For the most part, however, \"Dark Skies\" is a bore that even the most forgiving genre buffs will find difficult to defend or endure. The ostensible shocks are pedestrian, the story and characters are not particularly interesting and too much screen time is dedicated to subplots that go nowhere, such as Daniel's struggle to find work and older son Jesse's (Dakota Goyo) misadventures with a weird neighborhood kid who appears to have cycled in from \"Gummo\" and who is by far the creepiest thing in the film. Then there is the ending, or rather the lack of anything resembling a satisfying conclusion. Without going into too many details, it seems as if Stewart wanted to execute a Shyamalan-esque rug-pulling game-changer in the final reel. What he actually pulled off is the kind of hogwash that will leave viewers sitting in the dark, scratching their heads during the end credits in hopes that the necessary details will be spelled out at the last minute, as in the notorious wrap-up of \"Wild Things.\" Spoiler Alert \u2014 they aren't, so feel free to flee the minute the credits begin to roll, if not long before. In what can only be described as an act of pure perversity, \"Dark Skies\" opens with a quote from no less an authority than the late, great Arthur C. Clarke: \"Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.\" This is a profound notion that can set people of all stripes to contemplating their own place in the grand scheme of things. Maybe someday this quotation will get a chance to open a film that is worthy of it. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Ashes of Time Redux", "Review": "redux * [re-duhks] adj. brought back; revived If Wong Kar-Wai were a painter, he might sometimes create bold, bright swirls on his canvas, with something figurative swimming into view. That's my impression of \"Ashes of Time Redux,\" first released in 1994, now reduxed. I didn't see the first version, which the director considered unfinished, requiring 14 years of additional thought. So far has Kar-Wai's, or Wong's, art grown and deepened in the meantime (especially in the great \"In the Mood for Love\") that I am not quite sure why he set himself the task. Apparently he could not forget it, although many of his admirers have. Advertisement I watched attentively, I was dazzled by the beauty of the palate and the fluidity of the camera, and it was good to see familiar Hong Kong stars like Brigitte Lin, Leslie Cheung, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Tony Leung Ka Fai in younger days. I have had Chinese names explained to me a dozen times, about how the family name goes first and the first name goes last. It's just that I never know how to deal with names that are half Chinese and half Western. Surely it's not Lin Brigitte? IMDb is no help because they use their arcane knowledge of every name on earth, so if you follow them your editor is always complaining, \"that's not how the New York Times has it.\" I decided to eliminate the middle-man and go straight to the Times review, which alas does not include a cast listing and refers unhelpfully to \"both Tony Leungs,\" although this time it is made easy because Tony Leung Chiu Wai plays the Blind Swordsman and Tony Leung Ka Fai does not. While I was there I decided to find out how Manohla Dargis handled the plot, which is somewhat confusing. I respect her work. She attends to these things. Here is her plot description: \"See, there's this swordsman....\" That's it. That's all of it. Oh, wait, she adds that \"Mr. Cheung, as a desert dweller called Ouyang, is a broker for itinerant swordsmen and their prospective clients.\" She doesn't say which Mr. Cheung. Probably not the blind swordsman. I'm sure wisenheimers on the blogs will write, \"Did she really see it?\" I'm dead certain she did. I know I've seen it, and that's about as far as I could get. If you attempt to finish her sentence, you will find yourself either (a) lost in a thicket of interlocking flashbacking confusion, or (b) forced to fall back on the old evocation strategy, in which you are elusive and poetic (\"It is a humble little tavern in Chinese medieval times, but through its doors...\"). Sometimes a director is too familiar with the material. He has internalized it until it all makes sense to him. I remember when we were collaborating on \"Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens,\" and Russ Meyer would start lecturing about what Junk Yard Sal could or couldn't do until you'd swear she was a Greek goddess. \"Junk Yard Sal wouldn't do that!\" Russ would thunder. Once I said, \"Of course she would. I've got the typewriter.\" At least in Russ Meyer's cinema characters could or couldn't do things. That's why he is an artist and never had to make porn movies, in which the characters can do only one thing, or you want your money back. Advertisement But I stray. I enjoyed \"Ashes of Time Redux,\" up to a point. It's great-looking, and the characters all know what they would, although we do not. Wong Kar-Wai doesn't supply much of a plot with a narrative engine to pull us through. He adds section headings like Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter (a direct quote from e. e. cummings), but that only helps you to think, \"Oh, now I see! I don't understand it, but it's happening in Winter!\" It's perfectly okay in a case like this to relax and enjoy the experience. It is a beautiful film, and never boring, not with its swordfights and romantic angst. This is a lush and well-choreographed example of the wuxia genre, which I have just now found out about, although it reaches back to the 15th century and involves stories about swordplay and the martial arts. Wuxia means a lot less typing than \"swordplay and the martial arts,\" so I want you to remember it."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Trouble with the Curve", "Review": "Gus has been a baseball scout so long he can judge a batter by the sound when his bat connects with the ball. Did he always have this ability, or did it develop in recent years when his eyesight began to fail? The Atlanta Braves are on the edge of retiring him, but not if Gus (Clint Eastwood) has anything to say about it. He leads a lonely life, driving between small cities, sitting in the stands of minor league clubs, living in budget motels, but he loves it.  His boss and friend, Pete Klein (John Goodman), senses Gus' problems and appeals to the old man's daughter to check him out on the road. She is Mickey (Amy Adams), estranged from her father for years. She caves in and tracks him to the sunburned bleachers he occupies with other scouts and a handful of fans. He's focusing on a phenom named Bo Gentry (Joe Massingil), who is pudgy, but that doesn't slow him down because he slugs homers with the frequency of Babe Ruth. Advertisement This Bo isn't a nice guy. \"Hey, Peanut Boy!\" he calls to a vendor who tosses him a bag of peanuts. Bo doesn't see any need to pay him for the snack. Gus growls when he's joined by Mickey, who for that matter isn't too thrilled to see him. She's a hot-shot lawyer in a big Atlanta firm, in line for a partnership. But she sees her dad could use some help, and we learn she never wanted to be a lawyer, anyway. All she's ever loved is baseball. We settle now into a routine of discount motel rooms and bars and grills, as they cross paths with Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a pitcher who was originally recruited by Gus and then blew out his arm; he's now scouting for a season on the way to what he hopes will be an announcing job. Johnny and Mickey grow sweet about each other, and Gus begins to soften until it's time for a heart to heart with his daughter. That doesn't come easy for a man with a thick skin. Eastwood's appeal here is bedrock authority. He knows baseball, and he knows he knows it. Amy Adams, the embodiment of lovability since \"Junebug\" (2005), takes a standard role and makes us value it. Timberlake finds the right note for a basically one-note character. John Goodman embodies the guy who you hope has your back in the front office, and has a tense scene here where he makes a very hard call.  \"Trouble With the Curve\" isn't a great sports film, like Eastwood's \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004). But it's a superior entertainment, moving down somewhat predictable paths with an authenticity and humanity that appeals. It's his first film since \"In The Line Of Fire\" (1993) in which he acts but didn't direct. But he isn't that far from the director's chair because Robert Lorenz, this film's first-time helmer, has helped produce Eastwood's last 12 films, and was a second-unit director on others. Any Eastwood film is notable above all for its professionalism. If the story here has certain foreseeable moments, that's not to say they aren't set up well and deliver right on time. We might suspect that Bo Gentry and Peanut Boy (Jay Galloway) may meet again, but how it happens and how Mickey is involved, is classic movie gold. There are so many traffic jams in the typical recent hyperkinetic movie that to find a sound story this well told is a pleasure."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Daughter", "Review": "\"The Daughter\" comes bearing literary cred as a loose adaptation of Ibsen\u2019s 1884 play \u201cThe Wild Duck.\u201d It trades in a Norwegian backdrop for an economically bereft rural village in modern-day Australia while retaining the class-conscious premise of a family rocked by the revelation of long-held secrets and lies as it pits the privileged few against the depressed working class. There is still a duck, one that symbolically gets injured thanks to the none-too-sharp shooting skills of Henry (Geoffrey Rush, emitting varying degrees of aloofness), a wealthy owner of a century-old lumber mill that is on the verge of shutting down while fleeing residents seek work elsewhere. Meanwhile, the damaged fowl struggles to recover. And, soon, human creatures that have been harmed by Henry\u2019s undue past carelessness will be fighting in their own lives as well.\u00a0 Advertisement What is one to do when you take away a whole town\u2019s livelihood? Put on a lavish party, of course. Henry is the type who likes to throw money at problems and he is sparing little expense as he is about to turn his slinky housekeeper into wife No. 2, much to the chagrin of Christian (Paul Schneider, the lone Yank in the cast), his adult prodigal son who returns home from the States to be best man. With his own marital situation collapsing, the last thing he wants to do is witness his father marrying a woman half his age\u2014especially since his own mother was driven to suicide. A reunion with happy-go-lucky school chum Oliver (Ewen Leslie, an ingratiating presence who radiates a cool-dad likability) starts off warmly until Christian sees how content he is with devoted wife Charlotte (Miranda Otto), adoring teen daughter Hedvig (Odessa Young, a vivacious beauty with lilac-infused blunt cut hair) and his scatter-brained yet insightful father Walter (Sam Neill, subdued yet rock solid). Not even the fact that he is among those who lost their job at the mill can keep him down.\u00a0 Turns out, Christian is a recovering alcoholic given to violent and irrational outbursts when he goes on a bender. And the bottle soon beckons as it becomes clear he blames Henry for his mother\u2019s demise\u2014especially when he hears that Charlotte was once his father\u2019s housekeeper, too. That leads him to surmise the truth about a duplicitous situation while transforming into a malevolent bearer of bad news in the name of honesty, dead set on making all and sundry as miserable as he is.\u00a0 If you are getting the feeling that there are some sudsy operatic goings-on in director Simon Stone\u2019s movie debut, inspired by his stage adaptation of the play, you wouldn\u2019t be wrong. Not that he doesn\u2019t try to camouflage the melodramatic soap with ominous outdoor landscapes with towering tree trunks and dark gray billows of clouds gathering on the horizon. He also makes good use of a cavernous warehouse space populated with the decaying shells of cars where Hedvig and her young swain go to make out. To add a modern edge, Stone and his editor are big on a weird time-shifting technique, first showing a space devoid of actors as we hear dialogue being spoken and then quickly cutting to the actual scene. The off-kilter handheld camerawork frequently chases after the figures as they move about. But there is no disguising that there's much more talk than action in \u201cThe Daughter.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement At least Stone has collected an impressive cast who will keep you watching even when emotions lean toward the histrionic. Schneider might have the thankless duty of being the catalyst. But he is also the weak link, lacking in subtlety and given few redeeming qualities as he grows ever more determined to unleash emotional chaos like a vengeful and increasingly stubbly werewolf. He is supposed to be an outcast\u2014but he feels adrift in the movie as well. We spend too little time with the even-keel Christian at the beginning before he takes a turn for the worst to care much about him. But it is Young, a vibrantly natural presence who convincingly teeters between knowing rebel and vulnerable innocent, who captures our full attention. \u201cThe Daughter\u201d ends just as it begins\u2014with the sound of gunfire. The duck, alas, is allowed to escape relatively unscathed. The people on the screen, not so much. But somehow what comes close to dissolving into heartbreaking tragedy instead offers the merest whiff of hope for the future. As Neill\u2019s seen-it-all Walter says when all hell begins to break loose, \u201cEveryone\u2019s got a story like this \u2026 it\u2019s as old as the hills.\u201d If only said tale were told with a bit more consistency."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Secret Life of Bees", "Review": "As a realistic portrayal of life in rural South Carolina in 1964, \"The Secret Life of Bees\" is dreaming. As a parable of hope and love, it is enchanting. Should it have been painful, or a parable? Parable, I think, so it will please those who loved the novel by Sue Monk Kidd. One critic has described it as sappy, syrupy, sentimental and sermonizing, and those are only the S's. The same reviewer admitted that it is also \"wholesome and heartwarming,\" although you will never see \"wholesome\" used in a movie ad. Advertisement I go with heartwarming. There is such a thing as feeling superior to your emotions, but I trust mine. If I sense the beginnings of a teardrop in my eye during a movie, that is evidence more tangible than all the mighty weight of Film Theory. \"The immediate experience,\" one of the wisest of critics called it. That's what you have to acknowledge. I watched the movie, abandoned history and plausibility, and just plain fell for it. If it had been a bad movie, it would have been ripe for vivisection. But it is not a bad movie. Above all, it contains characters I care for, played by actors I admire. If a script doesn't get in the way, a movie like that just about has to work. Queen Latifah, who combines conviction, humor and a certain majesty, plays August Boatwright, a woman about as plausible as a fairy godmother, and so what? She lives outside town in a house painted the color of the Easter Bunny and gathers honey for a living. Famous honey, from happy bees. Living with her are her two sisters: June (Alicia Keys), a classical cellist and civil rights activist, and May (Sophie Okonedo), who you don't want to startle with anything sad. In a shack many miles away, 14-year-old Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) lives with her cruel father (Paul Bettany). Her best friend and defender, the black housekeeper Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson), endures the wrath of the father, because she will not abandon Lily. One day Rosaleen is so bold as to attempt to register to vote and is beaten by racists in the nearby town. This results, of course, in her arrest. Lily helps her escape the town, and they set off on a journey to the town of Tiburon, which she knows about because of something she found in her late mother's possessions ... the label for a honey jar. Advertisement As Lily helps Rosaleen flee from virtual slavery, it's impossible not to think about Huck and Jim, unless political correctness has prevented you from reading that greatest of all novels about black and white in America. From what little we see of the folks in Tiburon, they're as nice as the folks in Lily's hometown were mean. They land on August's doorstep. She takes them in, over resistance from the militant June. And there the proper story begins, involving discoveries about the past, problems in the present and hopes for the future. These are well-handled melodramatic events that would not benefit from being revealed here. Dakota Fanning comes of age in \"The Secret Life of Bees\" and in the somewhat similar but less successful \"Hounddog.\" She's not a kid anymore. She has always been a good actress, and she is only growing deeper and better. I expect her to make the transition from child to woman with the same composure and wisdom that Jodie Foster demonstrated. Here she plays a plucky, forthright and sometimes sad and needy young teen with the breadth this role requires and a depth that transforms it. Then observe Sophie Okonedo, the London-born, Cambridge-educated actress who has no trouble at all playing a simpleminded, deeply disturbed country girl. The English have little trouble with Southern accents. Michael Caine explained it to me once. It has to do with Appalachia being settled by working-class Brits. Her May is the heart of the film, because her own heart is so open. She has some delicate emotional transitions to traverse here and convinces us of them. Remember her in \"Hotel Rwanda\"? The Alicia Keys character, June, is really too complex for a supporting role. In the workings of the story, she functions as an eye-opener for Rosaleen, who has never guessed black women could be so gifted and outspoken. The three sisters live in an idyllic household that must have taken a powerful lot of honey sales, even then, to maintain. That isn't an issue. We believe it, because Queen Latifah as August beams watchfully on all before her, and nobody can beam like Latifah. If ever there was a woman born to be christened Queen, she's the one. I have great affection for this film because it honors a novel that many people loved for good reasons. It isn't superior, nor does it dumb it down. It sees what is good and honors it. The South was most likely not like this in 1964. That was the year the Civil Rights Act was passed, and a year before the Voting Rights Act became law. The Boatwright farm, as I said, is really a dream. But in those hard days, people needed dreams. Advertisement"}

Since the 11-year-old hero, Will Proudfoot (Bill Milner), is himself a cartoonist and sketch artist, his inventions seem to be seeping into his life. He leads an existence that's strictly limited by his family's religious beliefs, making him a vacuum for fantasy and escapism, and when his friend Lee Carter (Will Poulter) shows him a pirated copy of \"First Blood,\" the adventures of Rambo ignite him like fireworks whose time has come. Advertisement Set in an English village in the mid-1980s, \"Son of Rambow\" is a gentle story that involves a great deal of violence, but mostly the violence is muted and dreamy, like a confrontation with a fearsome scarecrow that looks horrifying but is obviously not real -- or real enough, but not alive. The two boys meet one day in the corridor outside their grade-school classroom. Will has been sent there because his religion forbids him to watch TV, even educational videos (it also forbids music, dancing, and so on). Lee has been booted out of his classroom, spots Will, and immediately beans him with a hard-thrown tennis ball. This is the beginning of a strange but lasting friendship. Lee takes Will into his garage, which looks like a tool kit for inventive kids. A rowboat hangs suspended from the ceiling, and there's equipment for pumping out videotape copies of the movies that Lee pirates at the local cinema, while puffing somewhat uncertainly on a filter-tip (yes, you could smoke in the movies in England in those days). Electrified by his introduction to Rambo, Will joins Lee in creating their own home-video remake of the film. This involves Will enacting literally death-defying stunts: He's catapulted high into the air, for example, and swings on a rope to drop into a lake, neglecting to tell Lee that he can't swim. The special effects are cobbled together from assorted household items, purloined booty, and Will's sketches and flip-book animation. All is not well at home, where Will lives with his mom (Jessica Stevenson), a sister, and his drooling grandma (Anna Wing). There's an unwelcome visitor in the house most of the time, Brother Joshua (the perfectly named Neil Dudgeon), who covets the role of Will's absent father, and enjoys being stern and forbidding to the lad. The intimacy of his relationship with the mother seems limited mostly to significant nods when he says goodbye at the end of the evening. Will and Lee find their world unsettled when a busload of French exchange students descends on their school, and Didier (Jules Sitruk) captures their admiration. Taller and older, Didier takes charge of their indie production and their lives. Meanwhile, their stuntwork escalates: They steal a oversized dog from the Guide Dogs for the Blind, hook it to a parasail and inadvertently set off fire alarms at their school. And a runaway Jeep causes a load of scrap metal to fall on Will and Lee, with surprisingly limited results. Advertisement All of this takes place in a pastoral countryside and a benign city, where the boys move more or less invisibly. They're not simply growing up, but expanding: their horizons, their imaginations, their genius for trouble-making. Since it is made clear at the start that little fatal or tragic is likely to happen, the movie becomes like a fable -- maybe too fabulous for its own good. The plot unspools with nothing really urgent at stake, the boys live in innocence and invulnerability, and the settings and action have a way of softening the characters. I liked \"Son of Rambow\" in a benign sort of way, but I was left wanting something more. Drama, maybe? No, that would simply be manufactured. Comedy? It is technically a comedy, although the limited laughs are incredulous. Fantasy? That it is, in a bittersweet way. After the movie, I imagined its writer-director, Garth Jennings (\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\") being more than a little like Will, and the movie uncannily similar to one of Will's comic epics."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "This Must Be the Place", "Review": "\"This Must Be the Place\" centers on another uncompromising character invention by Sean Penn, as an aging rock star who comes across like an arthritic bag lady and reveals without the slightest effort that he has a good heart and a quiet sense of humor. Few actors have played a wider variety of characters, and even fewer have done it without making it seem like a stunt. Cheyenne (Penn) was a big star in the 1980s, but has done little to stay in the spotlight. He now lives in a mansion in Ireland with his wife, Jane (Frances McDormand), who works as a firefighter because that's in her nature. Unlike some foolish ancient rock stars who trifle with groupies, Cheyenne seems to have been long and contentedly married; although he has sort of a groupie named Mary (Eve Hewson), he's more of a kindly uncle to her. Advertisement What he's never done is change his look. The film opens with him touching up his bright red lipstick and reinforcing his eyeliner, which are displayed on a clown white face framed by stringy jet black hair. Some rock stars have better taste \u2014 such as David Byrne, who attended design school and has been inspired in his own redesign. He appears in the film, does the music for it, and is an instructive contrast to Cheyenne. Cheyenne seems depleted. He walks slowly through a supermarket with a shopping cart and seems like he could use a Boy Scout on each arm. When he speaks, his voice is thin and reedy and doesn't seem to have any breath behind it. In Dublin, they know who he is and are accustomed to sightings. When he visits America, a lot of people don't stare because they instantly read him as an old lady clinging to the makeup of her youth. He flies to the United States to visit the bedside of his dying father. They haven't been on speaking terms, and now he learns the old man has died. His father has spent a lifetime in search of the Nazi guard who persecuted him at Auschwitz, and Cheyenne decides to take up the search himself. This leads him into the sort of road trip that's a perfect excuse for forlorn roadside diners and long shots of a car moving through a vast landscape.  The film has been directed and co-written by Paolo Sorrentino, a 42-year-old Italian filmmaker working for the first time in English. It's remarkable how comfortable he is with the American and Irish vernaculars and the way a land shapes its people.  One of the most convincing aspects of \"This Must Be the Place\" is how content Cheyenne is having kept the outer appearance of his famous days while having utterly lost interest in his career. When a young boy asks him to sing something, he replies, \"I don't do that anymore.\" Yet he's holding a guitar at the moment and plays a skillful riff that suggests he still rehearses.  It's a thing he doesn't do anymore, but it's a thing he still can do. Nor can he do the onstage acrobatics of a phenomenon like Mick Jagger, but it doesn't bother him. When a young fan tells Cheyenne, \"You used to sing with Mick Jagger!\" he replies politely but firmly: \"Mick Jagger used to sing with me.\" Although \"This Must Be the Place\" holds our attention, it's a little difficult to say where it's headed. That's only revealed toward the end. Getting out of the house was good for Cheyenne and still better was hunting for an old Nazi who may already be dead. Like a snake ready to shed its skin, he must get into motion for anything to happen. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Step Up All In", "Review": "Certainly you don\u2019t go to a \u201cStep Up\u201d movie for the\r\nglittering repartee. You go for the dazzling dance moves. But even by the\r\nstandards of this franchise\u2014and this genre in general\u2014\u201cStep Up All In\u201d is\r\npretty laughable. If only there were a way you could fast-forward through all\r\nthe junk while sitting in the movie theater\u2014the wooden delivery and\r\nbarely-there characterizations, the tedious exposition and contrived conflicts\u2014and just get to the performances. But alas, one must endure banal dialogue\r\nand a flimsy plot in order to enjoy the gravity-defying, acrobatic\r\nextravaganzas. It\u2019s enough to make you wish they\u2019d called the movie \u201cStep Up\r\nand Shut Up.\u201d  Advertisement Instead, the title of this fifth film in the series is as\r\nbland as the members of the competing dance crews that populate it. Perhaps\r\nthere\u2019s some allure here for true devotees in that characters from previous installments\r\nreturn and collaborate, \u201cFast-and-Furious\u201d-style. (Sadly, Channing Tatum\u2014who\r\nbegan his rise to superstardom in the original \u201cStep Up\u201d back in 2006\u2014is\r\nnowhere to be found. Then again, he has far better things to do these days.) If\r\nyou\u2019re a newbie, you won\u2019t be lost\u2014this isn\u2019t exactly a Christopher Nolan\r\nfilm in terms of narrative complexity\u2014but you\u2019ll probably be checking your\r\nwatch as you wait for the next dance number to start. Director Trish Sie\u2019s feature debut, with a script from John\r\nSwetnam, begins in lively fashion, though. Sean (the blankly handsome and hunky\r\nRyan Guzman) and his pals in the dance crew The Mob work their butts off at\r\ncommercial auditions while wearing ridiculous costumes and incorporating\r\nvarious products. It\u2019s the dance-film version of a rom-com bad date montage.\r\nThese are the performers who moved from Miami to Los Angeles after winning a spot\r\nin a high-profile Nike ad in the previous movie, 2012\u2019s \u201cStep Up Revolution,\" but now they\u2019re finding that surviving as working dancers in L.A. is nearly\r\nimpossible and decide to go back home\u2014all except Sean. He discovers a VH1 competition called \"The Vortex,\" which will\r\ngive one winning dance crew a three-year gig at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.\r\nThe host is the outlandish Alexxa Brava (the perky, Polish actress-dancer\r\nIzabella Miko), who clearly shops at the same boutique as Effie from \u201cThe\r\nHunger Games.\u201d She\u2019s super dramatic in her delivery as she announces the teams\r\nand the rules, but it\u2019s hard to tell whether she\u2019s going for over-the-top\r\nparody or run-of-the-mill Vegas cheese. Sean quickly assembles a new crew, including the\r\ngood-hearted Moose (series veteran Adam Sevani), who brings the group together;\r\nthe stubborn Andie (the Demi Moore-esque Briana Evigan from \u201cStep Up 2: The\r\nStreets\u201d); and the daffy Jenny Kido (Mari Koda, another series regular), who\r\nprovides broad comic relief. There are so many characters crammed in here,\r\nthough, that it\u2019s easy to forget that some of them even exist. Which is the guy\r\nfrom Baltimore and which is the one from the Bronx? Doesn\u2019t matter, really, as\r\nlong as they hit their marks sharply. Advertisement And they do\u2014they all do\u2014in increasingly elaborate dance\r\nnumbers. An early dance-off at a bar opposite the rival crew the Grim Knights\r\nis fun in an aggressive sort of way. The mad-scientist inspired performance\r\nthey concoct for their audition tape is a highlight (but please don\u2019t trouble\r\nyour mind wondering how they got a hold of all those costumes and props and\r\nshot it all with multiple camera angles).  But the big finale where the top four crews in the\r\ncompetition battle it out for world domination is a lengthy and thoroughly\r\nenjoyable spectacle that makes all the preceding dreck worthwhile. It\u2019s an\r\nawe-inspiring display of choreography, energy and athleticism. Naturally, the\r\nfinalists include Sean\u2019s new crew, his old crew and the crew they both can\u2019t\r\nstand, led by a sleazy Stephen \"Stev-O\" Jones. (This is not a spoiler. This is\r\nthe cosmically contrived way these things work out in movies like this,\r\nregardless of the kind of competition.) Will Andie get over her fear of injuring her knee again and\r\npull off that big, climactic stunt? Will Sean ever be able to pay his rent\r\nagain? Will Sean and Andie kiss as knew they would from the first second they met,\r\ndespite a complete lack of chemistry? And where did they get the flaming\r\ntorches for their climactic last dance? Shutting off your brain and putting on\r\nyour dancing shoes seems to be the only appropriate answer."}
{"Stars": 0.0, "Title": "Kingsman: The Golden Circle", "Review": "The franchise-style espionage thriller has long been ripe for a sendup, or a pastiche, or an update, or whatever the hell people think it\u2019s ripe for. The comic book \u201cKingsman\u201d provided the basis for 2015\u2019s \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service,\u201d a blockbuster sized action picture with, ostensibly, a cheeky attitude not unlike that of \u201cKick-Ass\u201d (also directed by Matthew Vaughn). For many, that movie filled the sendup/pastiche/update bill quite nicely. Instead of an official intelligence industry, the secret agent outfit Kingsman, operating out of a high-end tailor\u2019s shop, is a privatized law-enforcement security service with a lot of high-tech weaponry and convoluted cutting-edge tech protocol.  Advertisement The movie itself, a sort of bildungsroman in which raw recruit Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is given a class-conscious catapult to lethal gentlemanhood by older agent Harry (Colin Firth), was sufficiently slick and energetic that you might not notice at first what a callous, nihilistic, smirky, sexist, retrograde pile of expensive garbage it was. It even managed to make its last-call anal sex joke seem mildly charming \u2026 if you didn\u2019t think about it too much.  The true tell in the first film was the character of Gazelle, a henchperson of the main villain, a woman whose prosthetic legs are sharp knife edges. With these she can amputate limbs, and even cut a man entirely in half. These mutilations were depicted in a sterile, near analgesic fashion; the audience is meant to titter at the loss of life and limb delivered so efficiently, with no pain, no mess. Similar dismemberments and body halvings are delivered in the sequel, \u201cKingsman: The Golden Circle.\u201d It\u2019s violence for cowardly voyeurs who want to make the people who annoy them just shut up in a way that\u2019s silent, sterile, and thoroughly humiliating to the victim.  But the movie was successful, so now there\u2019s the sequel, cooked up in the script department by director Vaughn and Jane Goldman. If you think having a woman co-writing the screenplay will help in the egregious gross sexism department you are mistaken; one of this movie\u2019s \u201cgags\u201d involves putting a tracker on a villain\u2019s girlfriend by means of a form of sexual assault the current president of the United States once bragged about. Eggsy performs this act reluctantly, we are meant to understand, in part because he is now in a committed relationship with the Swedish Princess who gifted him with anal sex in the first movie.  \u201cKingsman: The Golden Circle,\u201d which finds the British tailors decimated and forced to join forces with a whiskey manufacturing U.S. spy network called \u201cStatesman\u201d and featuring such personages as Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry, is even longer than the first movie, clocking in at two hours and 20 minutes or so. As action-packed as the movie is, it feels like it\u2019s six hours. That\u2019s in part because the pacing is so spavined; the movie lurches twitchily from set piece to set piece and spends inordinate amounts of time on shots of its sharp-dressed characters slow-motioning into the widescreen frames showing off accessories that will be sold to you by various companies in various Kingsman tie-ins all over the Internet. (A scene wherein Firth is packing up his things finds the actor taking special care to make sure the wooden Art of Shaving soap dish is turned to the camera lens. In recent weeks, I\u2019ve received no less than a dozen e-mails from Art of Shaving, all tied in to \u201cKingsman.\u201d)\u00a0 Advertisement It also feels long because every bit or joke is dragged out long past its funniness or shock value. The plot here, just as reactionary in its way as that of the first one, centers around a drug cartel, the Golden Circle, run out of a jungle presided over by Julianne Moore\u2019s Poppy. (I hope the producers of this movie paid Moore an inordinate amount of money, because all she gives them in return for her fee is a passable Megan Mullally impersonation, which is still less than they deserve.) Poppy\u2019s very rich and powerful but also isolated and lonely, so she\u2019s kidnapped Elton John and is forcing him to perform solely for her. Elton John is played by himself. This is funny at first, then sour, then gets beaten worse than a dead horse as Sir Elton is made a plot point and a climactic action sequence is played out over one of his more raucous numbers. \u201cEnough,\u201d one thinks, but \u201cenough\u201d does not exist in the philosophy of this movie. Well, I suppose it does in one respect. In \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service,\u201d villain Valentine, played by Samuel L. Jackson, inveigled various world leaders into going along with his twisted save-the-earth doomsday scheme; he then implanted a device in their necks that, unbeknownst to them, could blow up their heads if triggered. One of the world leaders was meant to be taken for then-President Barack Obama. And at the movie\u2019s ending, all the head-exploding devices were made to go off, and the audience was invited to guffaw at the spectacle of Barack Obama\u2019s head blowing up. This movie\u2019s plot hinges on tainted drugs that will kill, potentially, all the world\u2019s substance abusers. The scheme, initiated by Moore\u2019s character, is reported by Fox News, none of whose correspondents are shown to have the sign of the taint. Because no one who works for Fox News does drugs, as we know. This movie also features a United States President, but not a real one, as the last film did; this movie\u2019s president is white, and played by Bruce Greenwood. It\u2019s probably just a coincidence that this movie is produced by Fox. It probably means nothing that this movie, made by people who invited you to laugh at the violent death of the United States\u2019 first black president, won\u2019t touch Donald Trump with a ten-foot pole. They can\u2019t be racist, right? They cast Halle Berry in this movie and Samuel L. Jackson in the last. They approve of black actors at least.  Speaking of actors, this is a movie that makes you wonder about them as a class. Can Colin Firth, Channing Tatum, Mark Strong, Jeff Bridges, Poppy Delevingne, Julianne Moore, Michael Gambon, and so many others in the cast be themselves as soul-dead and life-hating as this movie? If not (and it\u2019s probably, or at least hopefully, not) who do we blame? Their agents? The whole bloody system that\u2019s out of order?"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Princess and the Frog", "Review": "The opening scenes of Disney's \"The Princess and the Frog\" are like a cool shower after a long and sweaty day. This is what classic animation once was like! No 3-D! No glasses! No extra ticket charge! No frantic frenzies of meaningless action! And . . . good gravy! A story! Characters! A plot! It's set in a particular time and place! And it uses (calm me down here) lovingly hand-drawn animation that proceeds at a human pace, instead of racing with odd smoothness. I'm just gonna stand here and let it pour over me. Advertisement The movie, which is sweet and entertaining, doesn't quite live up to those opening scenes. But it's a demonstration that the Walt Disney Studio still shelters animators who know how to make a movie like that, in an age when too many animated films are like fast food after memories of mom's pot roast. My guess is that afterward the poor kids won't feel quite so battered by input overload. The film dances on the screen and doesn't come into the audience and shake you to make you like it. The story is set mostly in an African-American community in New Orleans, America's most piquant city, before and after World War I. We meet a young girl named Tiana, who is cherished by her mother Eudora (voice of Oprah Winfrey) and father James (Terrence Howard). Her mom is a seamstress, her dad a hard-working restaurant owner who stirs up a mighty gumbo. He goes off to the Army and doesn't return. For Tiana as an adult (Anika Noni Rose) life is a struggle, but she holds fast to her dream of opening a restaurant and serving up her dad's gumbo (with just a soupcon more red sauce). This is all shown in flowing, atmospheric animation and acted with fetching voices, but the songs by Randy Newman are -- I dunno, do you think he's getting sort of Randy Newmaned out? And the absence of a couple of terrific musical numbers is noticeable, I think, although younger viewers will probably be drawn into the story. You've heard it before. A princess kisses a frog, and it turns into a handsome Prince Charming. But what if instead she turns into a frog? (Spoiler: That's what happens. ) So now Tiana and the visiting Prince Naveen of Malvonia (Bruno Campos) are both amphibians, although, of course, they retain all of their moral principles and do not perform that act of which frogs are more fond than anything apart from croaking and eating flies. They're captives of a spell cast by the evil voodoo villain Dr. Facilier (Keith David). But life in the swamp is enlivened by two friends, Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley), an alligator who plays jazz saxophone, and Ray (Jim Cummings), a firefly who fills the Jiminy Cricket slot. They seek the occult Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis), who may have the power to offset Facilier, and whether Tiana and Prince Naveen are restored and settle down to happy lives of slurping gumbo, I will leave for you to discover. It is notable that this is Disney's first animated feature since \"Song of the South\" (1946) to feature African-American characters, and if the studio really never is going to release that film on DVD, which seems more innocent by the day, perhaps they could have lifted \"Zip-a-dee Doo-Dah\" from it and plugged that song in here. Though the principal characters are all black (other than the rich man Big Daddy and the Prince, who is of undetermined ethnicity), race is not an issue because Disney adroitly sidesteps all the realities of being a poor girl in New Orleans in the early 1920s. Just as well, I suppose. \"The Princess and the Frog\" inspires memories of Disney's Golden Age it doesn't quite live up to, as I've said, but it's spritely and high-spirited, and will allow kids to enjoy it without visually assaulting them.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Force", "Review": "Long before the events of Ferguson and the ascendancy of the Black Lives Matter movement, the city of Oakland, California was notorious for having both a high crime rate and a police force that was ridden with scandals involving prostitution, evidence tampering and brutality. In 2002, the department was put under federal oversight and given a mandate to reform under the threat of a complete takeover. This did not stem the tide of problems and the next decade saw a number of troubling incidents (including one that inspired the film \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d) and a revolving door of police chiefs who failed to inspire much trust in the local populace. Was it possible to implement any real and significant reforms or was the system as a whole so inherently flawed that it is beyond repair? The fascinating new documentary \u201cThe Force\u201d offers viewers the chance to ponder that question, while giving an eye-opening view of an ambitious attempt at department reform\u00a0that observes what went\u00a0right and what went\u00a0terribly wrong. Advertisement The focus of the film is on the tenure of Sean Whent, who was installed as police chief in 2013, promising a complete reform of the entire department. Realizing that one of his biggest problems was the complete mistrust that the citizens had towards the cops thanks to decades of troubles, Whent employs a series of new policies meant to mend fences with the community. They range from a crackdown on police silence towards the misdeeds of their colleagues to the implementation of body cams to outreach programs designed to give civilians the chance to voice their frustrations and complaints about the department. With new recruits, he tries to instill in them an understanding about the needs and concerns of the community and tries to impress upon them the importance of a less-aggressive approach to policing. Between the force\u2019s bad reputation and chronic understaffing, Whent\u2019s ambitions might have struck some as pipe dreams but his efforts did have some immediate and impressive results\u2014a 60% drop in complaints against officers, a complete halt in incidents with officers shooting suspects and a general drop in the crime rate. Whent\u2019s efforts receive worldwide attention (we see him being interviewed for French television) and, more importantly, they even inspire the beginnings of a newfound sense of trust from the community. Alas, it doesn\u2019t last. After a couple of years, the number of controversial officer-related shootings begins to rise\u2014one is shot in the back while the other was revealed to be carrying a replica pistol. Later it is revealed that several cops were involved with sexual misconduct with an underage prostitute, igniting a scandal that winds up taking down Whent when it is suggested that he tried to protect the accused in order to prevent the derailing of his reform efforts. Employing a cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 approach to the material, director Peter Nicks (who won the Best Director prize for documentaries at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival) quietly observes all of these goings-on,\u00a0giving voice to the police and the community of Oakland without offering any overt commentary of its own. From what we see, however, it slowly becomes evident that Whent\u2019s reform efforts, no matter their good intentions and initial success, were doomed to eventually fail because the recruits arriving already possessing the kind of aggressive mindset that is difficult to fully overcome. In one especially revealing episode, we witness a class where the recruits are presented dash cam video showing a suspect getting out of a car against police orders while holding something that proved to be a knife and being shot 13 times. Were all 13 shots really necessary, especially since the suspect was far enough away to not be able to do anything with the knife? Could it have been handled with one shot or, God forbid, no shooting at all? For most of the cops, they have no problem with what would appear to be a case of excessive force (when reminded that the suspect had a knife, not a gun, one cop exclaims \u201cHe could throw it!\u201d) Meanwhile, a black female recruit tries to get a word in edgewise to raise her objections to the shooting\u2014the same complaints that the community has been voicing for years\u2014but finds herself shouted down or simply ignored by most of her colleagues. It is a moment that is both heartbreaking and anger-inducing, a perfect encapsulation of the kind of mindset that leads so many people today to have a lack of faith that the police have their best interests at heart. Advertisement The only time that \u201cThe Force\u201d steps wrong is in the final scenes dealing with the ever-widening sex scandal and the turmoil that the department is plunged into as a result. The problem is that a torrent of new information is suddenly thrown at us in a manner that the fly-on-the-wall directorial approach is not especially well-equipped to handle\u2014it cries out for a switch to a more investigative viewpoint that would help better process all the details, especially regarding what Whent may or may not have done once the scandal hit. Beyond that, this is a strong film that tackles a charged subject in a fair and even-handed manner. \"The\u00a0Force\"\u00a0will give viewers of all social and political persuasions much to think about afterwards."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Crazies", "Review": "\"The Crazies\" is a perfectly competent genre film in a genre that has exhausted its interest for me, the Zombie Film. It provides such a convenient storytelling device: Large numbers of mindless zombies lurch toward the camera as the hero wreaks savage destruction; they can be quickly blown away, although not without risk and occasional loss of life. When sufficient zombies have been run through, it's time for a new dawn. I know there can be good Zombie Films. I've seen some: \"Dawn Of The Dead\" (1979), \"28 Days Later,\" \"Shaun of the Dead\" and so on. If I saw another one like those, I'd like it. But all depends on good living characters, and a director with something new to say about zombies, who are a subject easily exhausted. Advertisement Are the zombies in \"The Crazies\" real zombies? Maybe, maybe not. Is there an agreed definition of what is a zombie and how they get that way? Not that I know of. I think zombies are defined by behavior and can be \"explained\" by many handy shortcuts: the supernatural, radiation, a virus, space visitors, secret weapons, a Harvard education and so on. I suppose it would be a \"spoiler\" if I revealed why the Crazies are on the lurch, but come on, does it matter? What if I revealed they got that way because of, oh, say, eating Pringles? Would that spoil things for you? What difference does it make? All that matters is that they got to be zombies somehow. Before that, they were your friends and neighbors. Then they started in on the damn Pringles. The protagonists of course have to be healthy. I cannot imagine a zombie as a leading character. Vampires -- now that I grant you. Werewolves. But a zombie doesn't bring much to the party. So we start in sweet little Ogden Marsh, Iowa, described on its Web site as \"the friendliest place on Earth,\" and no wonder. Its sheriff is so good-looking, he could be the star of this movie. Must be a quiet town. The sheriff's office is open only from 8 to 5, Monday through Friday. One day after work, Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) and his deputy, Russell Clank (Joe Anderson), are watching a local school baseball game when the town drunk comes lurching into the outfield holding a shotgun. When the autopsy shows he had a 0.0 blood alcohol level, that's the first signal something is wrong in Ogden Marsh. For one thing, their town drunk is a slacker. The sheriff's wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell), is the local doctor. She starts treating some strange cases. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll simply say Sheriff Dave and Deputy Joe discover the probable origin of this plague, but of course can't get the mayor to declare an emergency, because he learned the mayoring trade from \"Jaws.\" Meanwhile, it's up to Dave, Judy and Joe to defend themselves from zombies, and survive after the town is isolated and quarantined and the cure seems worse than the disease. Advertisement That requires many scenes involving people and objects that jump out from the sides of the screen with loud noises and alarming musical chords. I'm thinking, so what? The last thing I need is another Jump Out/ Loud Noise/Alarming Chord Movie. Even a well-made one -- like this one, directed by Breck Eisner. It was inspired by George Romero's 1973 movie of the same name, although I can't tell you if the zombies match, because that would be a spoiler. What I can say to aspiring young screenwriters is: Movies like this are fairly simple to write. You need zombies. You need heroes. At first there's mystery, and then the horror. You describe lots of Jump/ Noise/Chord situations. When you figure you're up to around 90 minutes, the sun can rise. You'll get an R rating, so throw in a little nudity. Not too much, because if there's a combination that gives me the creeps, it's zombies and nudity. Especially when -- but never mind. That's enough for today."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Cake", "Review": "No good can ultimately come from a movie that is as obsessed with wind chimes as \u201cCake.\u201d That constant tinkle-tinkle should be a warning that what starts off as a medical drama with a healthy nasty streak won\u2019t be able to resist slapping a bandage on all the badness in the end. But it is worth sitting through just to watch Jennifer Aniston pull off a performance of a lifetime. The funny lady has gone dramatic before to fine effect in such indie outings as 2002\u2019s \u201cThe Good Girl\u201d and 2006\u2019s \u201cFriends With Money.\u201d But not like this. You won\u2019t be able to take her eyes off of her, which is a good thing since it will take a while to notice that the film surrounding her starts to go soft around the edges until it collapses all together. Like an underdone, well, cake. Advertisement Aniston certainly doesn\u2019t need an Oscar nomination to validate what she achieves as a chronic pain sufferer. It is not so much that she doesn\u2019t wear makeup or her hair is limp and greasy. Or that squiggly scars are plastered on her face and limbs, the cause of which takes a ridiculous amount of time to be revealed in dribs and drabs. It\u2019s the desperate-for-relief look in her eyes and the way that every move she makes is an ordeal. Even the small groans and grunts she regularly emits are more agonizing in their restraint than a full-out scream would be.\u00a0 As well-off L.A. divorcee Claire Simmons, she is cranky. She is bitter. She is highly inappropriate, especially when she sleeps with her gardener. She lies to get what she wants and steals to get what she needs \u2013 which usually are Percocet and maybe OxyContin with a voluminous chaser of white wine. Even those who are paid to be nice and caring, like her swim therapy instructor, can\u2019t stand to be around her. If Raid manufactured a human repellant, it would be called Claire. In the very first scene she gets kicked out of her touchy-feely support group led by an insufferably simpy leader (a nearly unrecognizable Felicity Huffman) for expressing her admiration for a member named Nina who summoned the nerve to leap off a freeway overpass to her death. The domino effect of weeping that her words induce is sickly amusing. Claire is basically the Bad Santa of patients. The one humanizing slice of \u201cCake\u201d that is tolerable is Claire\u2019s relationship with her Mexican housekeeper, Silvana (the terrific Adrianna Barraza, who was Oscar-nominated for 2006\u2019s \u201cBabel\u201d). The natural-born nurturer might be a saint as she puts up with Claire\u2019s rudeness, awful behavior and constant demands. But she isn\u2019t stupid. Probably the best sequence in \u201cCake\u201d is when Claire tells Silvana she has to drive her across the border to replenish her supply of illegal pills at a Tijuana pharmacy.\u00a0 The clerk offers to stash the drugs in a holy statue. \u201cI have problems with anything religious,\u201d Claire gripes. \u201cYou have bigger problems,\u201d he rightfully notes.\u00a0However, a restaurant encounter where Claire comes to Silvana\u2019s rescue suggests there is some hint of kindness lurking beneath that brittle exterior. Advertisement \n If \u201cCake\u201d were just the Claire and Silvana show, it might have been more tolerable. The see-saw act between privileged mistress and tolerant worker is in its way intriguing, since Silvana is far richer in what matters than Claire. I would even allow room for the cameos by that freakish opossum who pays nocturnal visits to the backyard pool. But there is a plot to tell and Cake starts to fall flat every time Claire hallucinates that Nina\u2019s ghost has materialized in the form of Anna Kendrick oozing mean-girlish attitude to discuss the ins and outs of pulling off a suicide. Clearly, Claire is suffering from please-put-me-out-of-my-misery envy in a very big way. \n Director Daniel Barnz and writer Patrick Tobin allow matters to get truly questionable when Claire hunts down and hangs out with the sad husband (Sam Worthington of \u201cAvatar,\u201d with cute Aussie accent intact) and wee son that Nina has left behind. Romance isn\u2019t exactly in the air, yet there is a connection. Will Claire clean up her act or simply have a doozy of a meltdown? Or both? Or will a shady stranger suddenly show up and agree to bake her a cake to better justify the title of the movie? It doesn\u2019t matter. I like Aniston\u2019s Claire. I rank her right up there with Frances McDormand\u2019s Olive Kitteridge, Edie Falco\u2019s Nurse Jackie and Robin Wright\u2019s First Lady on \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d as damaged women you shouldn\u2019t necessarily admire but can\u2019t help but love."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "O'Horten", "Review": "The thing about a deadpan comedy is, it has to think. It must involve us in the lives of its characters, so we can understand why they are funny while at the same time so distant. \"O'Horten,\" a bittersweet whimsy by the Norwegian director Bent Hamer, finds that effortless. It is about a retiring railroad engineer named Odd Horten. \"Odd\" is a common enough first name in Norway, but reflect that English is widely used in Scandinavia. O'Horten is a quiet, reflective man, a pipe-smoker, who lives alone but is not lonely and sets his life by the railroad timetable. He is baffled by retirement. He's not sure when he should be anywhere. After the retirement party thrown by his fellow engineers, who sing him a choo-choo-choo woo-woo-woo song, he is uncertain. An evening begins on an inauspicious note when he is unable to get into a colleague's apartment, climbs a scaffolding in freezing weather, lets himself into someone's else's window and finds himself in conversation with a small boy. Advertisement O'Horten has his consolations. One is Mrs. Thogersen (Githa Norby), a sweet silvery-haired widow who lives at the end of the Oslo-Bergen run. He is accustomed to overnighting in her arms. \"So ... this is the end?\" she asks on his last run. Apparently so. It doesn't occur to him that they could rendezvous without him driving a train there. Left to his own devices, O'Horten allows himself to be drawn into uncertain circumstances. There is the case of Trygve Sissener (Espen Skjonberg), a curious old man who informs O'Horten, \"Ever since I was young, I have been able to see with my eyes closed.\" To prove it, he takes O'Horten on a drive through Oslo with a black hood pulled over his head. You would think this experience would be terrifying for an engineer who once hit a moose on the tracks, but no, he puffs his pipe, interested. His Oslo resembles the macabre Stockholm of the director Roy Andersson, whose \"Songs from the Second Floor\" was shown at Ebertfest a few years ago. Inexplicable events seem to be a matter of course. Why, for example, would well-dressed businessmen slide on their fannies down an icy incline? O'Horten is probably wondering the same thing but doesn't inquire. Odd is played by Baard Owe, a trim, fit man with a neat mustache, who may cause you to think a little of James Stewart, Jacques Tati or Jean Rochefort. He has some regrets. He was never an Olympic ski jumper like his mother. Too afraid. He never really developed any hobbies. He has few friends. He was on the rails too much. He prides himself in perfection on the job but has no need for perfection in his life. At least a pipe smoker can always count on his pipe."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Magic Mike", "Review": "Whether you're a man or woman, making money by allowing people to push cash inside your g-string is, I think we can agree, demeaning. It's probably worse for women, because the big spenders with $2 probably harbor some vague dream of sleeping with them. In the case of male strippers, I suspect their female fans are looking more for fun and some laughs on their girls' night out. I could be wrong about this. I'm right about the job, however. Selling anyone the right to touch your genital area for a couple of bucks is not a good way to build self-esteem. Steven Soderbergh's \"Magic Mike\" makes this argument with a crafty mixture of comedy, romance, melodrama and some remarkably well-staged strip routines involving hunky, good-looking guys. I have a feeling that women will enjoy the film more than men.  Advertisement Or maybe not. The sculpted bodies on display are a monument to narcissism; a guy who spends hours a day improving his pecs and abs may offer limited conversational skills. Kelly Oxford, the Canadian housewife who won a Hollywood contract for her tweets, just the other week tweeted: \"FWIW, I'd rather f*** a 260-pound guy than a body builder.\" \"Magic Mike\" has the fascination of most backstage movies: It shows a naive kid being drawn into the world of show business. He is Adam (Alex Pettyfer), a handsome 19-year-old, who meets Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) while they're working on a roofing job. Mike dances three nights a week at Xquisite, a marginally successful Tampa strip club. Mike brings Adam along to the club, where he's fast-talked by the boss, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). The kid has no desire to strip but is pushed onstage wearing his street clothes and told to undress down to his jockey shorts. He is awkward and embarrassed \u2014 and not surprisingly an enormous hit, because the ladies think his shyness is an act and love it. \"Magic Mike\" seems to know a lot about male strip clubs. Tatum worked as a dancer when he was 19; he co-produced this film, which was written by his producing partner, Reid Carolin. We learn what the rules are, how the money is shared, and how there's extra income when the guys guest-star at private parties. There's backstage humor as these muscle men powder their noses and make themselves up like burlesque queens, and a dark side, as the kid Adam begins to be pulled toward drugs. Dallas is the charismatic impresario of the business, which essentially involves him renting a club, paying for costumes and production, and allowing his dancers to keep their own tips. He's the first one we see onstage, using his hands to point to his naughty bits, asking the ladies if they'd like to touch them, and then wagging his finger and saying \"No-no-NO-no!\" That may not sound like much of a scene, but think how easily it could go wrong. This is actually one of McConaughey's best performances, as a hard-headed businessman who understands his product and his audience. Magic Mike has a long-range plan to own a custom furniture business, but is having trouble raising capital (there's a timely scene with a bank loan officer). Having recruited Adam for the club, he now meets the kid's protective sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), and promises her no harm will come to her brother. They begin to fall in love, and this subplot feeds off the gradual revelation of the more dismaying aspects of male stripping. Tatum is a likable actor and we believe Mike's good intentions, but like all the dancers, he has become the captive of the nightly paydays.  Advertisement The choreography, costumes and production values of the shows look slick and professional, considering the fly-by-night nature of Dallas' business. We see the strippers as soldiers, construction workers and other Village People archetypes, and the stage flows with smoke from dry ice. The movie sidesteps such details as stagehands, lighting directors and so on, and there is no suggestion that any of the dancers may be gay.  Adam's descent into drug-fueled depravity is portrayed with merciless detail; when you sleep with a girl who has a pet piglet and wake up with the little fella eating your vomit, surely you've hit bottom. \"Magic Mike\" starts as fun and grows steadily darker; Soderbergh and cast tell a realistic, vivid story. You get a feeling of realism and research, for example, when a chubby fan throws herself into the arms of a muscular dancer, and the poor guy throws his back out."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Artist and the Model", "Review": "\"The Artist and the Model\" is a simple, straightforward film about the wonder and awe that the natural world inspires in us. It elicits such wonder and awe in the viewer mainly by holding its steady gaze upon beautiful or beautifully arrayed things under sunlight. \"You can't create this light,\" the artist of the title says at one point while peering around his canvas at his nude model, who stands in a field where a combination of drifting pollen, shifting clouds, swaying branches and fluttering leaves gives the light a restless, flickering quality. He tries to reproduce it with dappled, mottled, uneven applications of paint.  Advertisement The same restless light falls on the canvas and on the painter's majestically aged face. Beauty everywhere. This film's all-over gorgeousness, extended even, at one point, to a Nazi officer decked out in full Reich regalia, is a rare pleasure these days. Director Fernando Trueba and his screenwriter, the legendary Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re (\"That Obscure Object of Desire\") almost make an essay of it: Their point is that there's nothing superficial about the surfaces of things, particularly in the case of human beings, whose eyes, faces and body language betray their histories and inner lives; it's a matter of being willing and able to see what's really there. Trueba, using black and white widescreen cinematography by Daniel Vilar, is going for elemental truths and universal pleasures. After his wife Lea (Claudia Cardinale) discovers an incandescent Spanish beauty bathing in a fountain, reclusive French painter-sculptor Marc Cros (Jean Rochefort) offers the young waif, Merc\u00e8 (Aida Folch) a job modeling for his latest sculpture. It's 1943 in occupied France, and Cros hasn't worked in his country studio since the beginning of the war. The girl turns out to be an escapee from a prison camp who helps resistance fighters sneak across the border to Spain. The film handles these plot points with graceful efficiency, but they are as marginally interesting to Trueba as they are to Cros, whose philosophy on war can be summed up by something Francois Truffaut once wrote in response to criticisms that he had abandoned political reality in his work: \"In troubled periods the artist hesitates. He is tempted to abandon his art and to make his art subservient to an idea. Through film he becomes a propagandist. When this thought occurs to me, I think of Matisse. He lived through three wars untouched. He was too young for 1870, too old for the war of 1914, a patriarch in 1940. He died in 1954 between the wars in Indochina and Algeria having completed his life\u2019s work, his fish, women, flowers, landscapes framed by windows. The wars were trivial events in his life. The thousands of canvases were the serious events.\" In fact, Cros does claim to pursue an \"idea\" but not in the cheap sense that Truffaut meant. Like Matisse, who is mentioned as a friend of the fictional Cros, our protagonist is subservient to nothing but the pursuit of an essential idea that illuminates all of life. His focus is even narrower than Matisse's: making women the subject of every work. The political persecution happening a few miles from his cabin doorstep are merely the background noise of \"savages.\" He says that only two things confirm the existence of God, and his paintings and sculptures of women in repose amount to a testament to the \"first thing.\" Advertisement \"The Artist and the Model\" is the kind of arthouse film that old-fashioned American grindhouse distributors who dabbled in Euro cinema would have loved: the female protagonist spends roughly 70% of her screen time naked. The camera explores every curve with reverence. An obligatory gang of neighborhood kids climb up the sloping forest hills to get a peep at the nude model and later get smacked around by an officious priest straight out of Fellini and Bunuel. Various scenes end with tidy one-liners and winsome smiles. These conventions give the film a shape as lazily pleasing as Folch's, but a sublime scene midway invites us to give ostensibly stock situations a longer, deeper look. Cros analyzes a simple Rembrandt sketch which he calls the greatest picture ever made. Cros's description of the work is one of the most eloquent and passionate visual essays on art, imagination and compassion that I have ever encountered. It can also plays as an admonishment to the modern Twitterized world, in which even major artists have become resigned to the dominance of a splintered, glancing, dehumanizing gaze.  From there the film just gets lovelier and lovelier, distilling its ideas through the simplest of moving images. Cros struggles terribly, crossed-out sketch after crossed-out sketch, discarded clay model after discarded clay model, to find his grand statement. He visits his neighbor, a sculptor of marble who mostly makes tombstones, to check on the progress of his own tombstone. Time is running out. Merc\u00e8's involvement with a wounded Spanish resistance fighter pales beside the suspense of Cros's basically spiritual quest. With Merc\u00e8 more receptive to his strange methods, he tries to explain himself further by re-telling the story of Adam and Eve in what sounds like an even more male chauvinist light than the Old Testament version. In his re-imagining, God crafted Eve as his perfect companion and Adam was merely their offspring. The way Rochefort tells it, though, we see what Trueba and Carriere are getting at, that women are the essential creation, men merely utilitarian accessories."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Cage Fighter", "Review": "In the parking lot of a gym where he sometimes works as an instructor, Joe Carman is turning a huge tractor tire over, and over, and over. There\u2019s a guy who\u2019s spotting him\u2014inasmuch as you can spot someone who\u2019s manhandling a gargantuan slab of rubber\u2014and Joe asks the fellow, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d \u201c24\u201d is the reply, and Joe responds, gruffly but wistfully, \u201cOh, I wish I was 24 again.\u201d Joe wishes a lot of things. Mainly, he wishes to continue a sideline career in cage fighting, the semi-pro subset of mixed martial arts. Now 40, on his second marriage, a doting father to four daughters, Joe makes his living in a boiler room working for the Seattle Ferry service, doing maintenance. But he lives to fight. Being 40 isn\u2019t the only problem with this determination. The fact that he\u2019s promised his family that he won\u2019t is another.    Advertisement \u201cThe Cage Fighter\u201d is a documentary directed by Jeff Unay, who has a background doing post-production effects work for movies such as Peter Jackson\u2019s \u201cKing Kong\u201d and James Cameron\u2019s \u201cAvatar.\u201d This is not the movie you\u2019d necessarily expect from him, but his background definitely influenced his storytelling style. This brisk, concise movie (it\u2019s only 80 minutes long) combines a you-are-there feel with an innate sense of storytelling structure. Even an ordinary event like Joe making pancakes for his kids is shot and edited with an economy and sense of purpose related to dramatic narrative. This, combined with the fact that Joe is likable, and his daughters at least are appealing foils, makes \u201cThe Cage Fighter\u201d a movie that\u2019s a pleasure to watch.    Your mileage may vary depending on how tightly you latch on to the story. Although it\u2019s a documentary, \u201cThe Cage Fighter\u201d teems with characters that are familiar from fictional tales. Goodness knows that the almost-washed-up-boxer is a stock character nearly as old as cinema itself. \u201cThe Cage Fighter\u201d gets some extra juice from the fact that Joe\u2019s compulsion to continue fighting is in some sense a mystery even to himself. When he\u2019s in the ring, he says to his furious wife, \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself \u2026 I like me.\u201d But in a sense you can see he knows he\u2019s making excuses. His oldest daughter, not without affection, calls him out pretty sharply: \u201cOne more fight, I have to redeem myself \u2026 one more fight, I need closure,\u201d she says in an unsparing impersonation of her dad.    Some clues as to what drives Joe come out when the fighter visits his own dad, a lout of near-staggering proportions who serves as a negative role model. And the mystery of what drives a man to seek glory in cage fights is underscored in two scenes. In one, a colleague observes \u201cCage fighters are like strippers \u2026we\u2019re cool to hang out with, but not much else \u2026 something has to be wrong with us.\u201d And late in the film, Joe sits down with Clayton Hoy, a much younger MMA star whom Joe hopes to at least face off against some time. Over beers, Hoy reveals to Joe just how much of a mess his own life has become. Getting beat up for little money and a very particular amount of attention\u2014what\u2019s the deal with that?   Thinking that despite all the good things you\u2019ve got in life, there has to be something more isn\u2019t just a crisis in masculinity, as this movie unavoidably frames it; it\u2019s possibly part of the human condition. \u201cDiscipline is an act of freedom\u201d is an adage painted on the wall of Joe\u2019s gym. You could substitute \u201cacceptance\u201d for \u201cdiscipline\u201d and still be correct. Is Joe\u2019s lack of acceptance a mental block that will eventually deprive him of everything he\u2019s got, or is it a motivating force that will push him to greater heights? The movie ends with the question unanswered \u2026 but the odds don\u2019t seem to be in Joe\u2019s favor. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Tickled", "Review": "\u201cI\u2019ve made a career out of looking at the weird and bizarre\r\npart of life,\u201d New Zealand-based television journalist David Farrier says at\r\nthe beginning of this documentary, whose title doesn\u2019t even begin to hint at\r\nthe depths of peculiarity this particular story ends up digging into. From the\r\nsamples of Farrier\u2019s work the movie shows, the appealing reporter is a younger,\r\nhipper variant on CNN\u2019s Jeanne Moos, a collector of novelty human-interest\r\nstories. As most collectors of novelty human-interest stories do, Farrier has a\r\nhealthy relationship to the Internet, and as he tells it, he was intrigued,\r\nwhile surfing it of an evening, to come upon what were billed as \u201cCompetitive\r\nTickling\u201d videos.  Advertisement At this point in the movie there\u2019s a clip in which two\r\nadolescent boys, dressed in high-school wrestler\u2019s gear, hold down a third\r\nfellow and, yep, tickle him. The subject or victim, as you will, has the\r\ncustomary reaction to being held down and tickled: he laughs and squirms. It\u2019s\r\ndifficult to see where the \u201ccompetitive\u201d side of it happens. To a\r\nnon-fetishist, the whole thing looks rather pointless, among other things, but\r\nhey, the enlightened viewer can also shrug \u201cnothing human is alien to me\u201d and\r\nlive and let live and all that. Farrier figures the purveyors of this oddball\r\nmaterial won\u2019t mind some exposure. But when he gets in touch with the firm that\r\nprofesses to represent the makers of the video, he receives, in response, a\r\nrude e-mail saying that the firm does not want to associate with a homosexual\r\njournalist. (Farrier is gay, and out.) A request for clarification is met with\r\na response containing a homophobic slur. This piques Farrier\u2019s curiosity, but\r\nhe doesn\u2019t really have a good idea of just what kind of bear, so to speak, he\u2019s\r\npoking. Soon he and his producing partner are threatened with what would be, if\r\ntried, a very expensive lawsuit. Remember, nothing up to this point has gone\r\nany further than \u201cI\u2019d like to do a story on you.\u201d Then, more weirdness. A\r\ncouple of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of the company fly out to New Zealand, first class,\r\nwith the idea of ironing things out with Farrier. These odd, camera-shy folks\r\ndon\u2019t have much to say on arrival except \u201cstop.\u201d Why it was necessary for them\r\nto fly around the world to deliver the message in person seems as much a\r\nmystery to them as it is to Farrier.  Farrier and his television segment-producing partner Dylan\r\nReeve\u2014the two are also the co-directors of this movie\u2014then fly to the United\r\nStates, where the videos are produced. They\u2019re in the most interesting position\r\na journalist can find him or herself in\u2014determined to get to the bottom of the\r\nstory, without having too much of an idea what the story really is. Tracking\r\ndown a shooting site in Los Angeles, they surprise one of the fellows who had\r\nbeen out to visit them in New Zealand. They then trek to a town on the other\r\nside of the country from where a lot of teen boys were recruited for tickling\r\nvideos. Eventually they figure out what the viewer likely already inferred:\r\n\u201ccompetetive tickling\u201d does not exist, and the videos are non-pornographic\r\nfetish tapes made by parties who get very, very agitated at any suggestions\r\nthat they are fetish tapes. A couple of participants in the videos tell\r\nharrowing tales of blackmail and exploitation, while makers of cheerfully out\r\ntickling fetish videos share their craft and tell disturbing tales of a\r\nmysterious outlier producing similar material who\u2019s making life difficult for\r\neveryone doing it on the up-and-up. (Not that there are so many of those: as\r\nfetishes go, tickling really is pretty specialized.)\u00a0 The web that Farrier and Reeve discover is shown to be more and more elaborate,\r\nand the story eventually becomes one of corruption, shame, closeting, and more.\r\nFarrier and Reeve discover the identity of their lawsuit-threatening tormentor,\r\nand manage to turn the tables on this individual, at least somewhat, but\r\n\u201cTickled\u201d doesn\u2019t build to a cheerleading climax. Instead, what occurs is like\r\na sadder version of the drawing-back-of-the-curtain in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d A\r\nrevelation more pathetic than awe-inspiring. The moviemakers craft a satisfying narrative while leaving\r\nthe viewer with some questions; this is a movie that manages to be disquieting\r\nand entertaining simultaneously.

{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Blood Money", "Review": "For an hour, Lucky McKee\u2019s \u201cBlood Money\u201d is aggressively annoying, the kind of film with no likable or believable characters, and one of those cheap VOD flicks in which it feels like everyone was there purely for the paycheck. The final 20 minutes of this B-movie reveal why a few talented people were interested in making it, but it\u2019s too little too late by that point, especially since most people who watch this at home will have moved on to something else anyway. Victor (Ellar Coltrane of \u201cBoyhood\u201d), Jeff (Jacob Artist) and Lynn (Willa Fitzgerald) are going on a rafting trip but bringing enough baggage with them to sink their boat. The three are old friends but Jeff is \u201cwith\u201d Lynn now, although they\u2019re trying to keep that a secret from Victor, who may or may not have a crush on Lynn. Sadly, most of this early character exposition is clunky and inconsistent. The dialogue alternates between unbelievable and moronic, and the actors don\u2019t do enough to make this trio of idiots easy to root for. Far more interesting is the criminal Miller (John Cusack), who\u2019s dressed like a \u201cMetallica groupie\u201d and looking for the millions of dollars he just stole, parachuting with it out of a plane D.B. Cooper-style. One can guess who finds the money.

Good guy Victor immediately wants to turn it in, knowing that no good can come of bags of money found in the woods. Lynn has other ideas. Screwed over by a bad knee that has derailed her future, at least in her mind, she sees the money as karmic justice for the shit she\u2019s had to put up with, and \u201cBlood Money\u201d gets way more interesting when Lynn\u2019s search for retribution gains a bit of a gender-edge. Fitzgerald totally sells a great scene in which Lynn rails about how she was an equal friend of Victor and Jeff\u2019s until she hit puberty and became property to fight over. I wish \u201cBlood Money\u201d invested more time and energy in this theme of male possessiveness, especially earlier, when the film feels unfocused and uncertain.    Part of that first hour feels borderline incomplete. The dialogue is clunky\u00a0in such a way that you\u2019ll think your DVD skipped a few seconds, and the characters are weirdly inconsistent. There\u2019s an \u201cexposition while the kids drink a few\u201d scene early on that is bafflingly written and edited. The rhythm is all off. And McKee, so good at bringing tension and atmosphere to \u201cMay\u201d and \u201cThe Woman,\u201d can\u2019t get excited about this material. It\u2019s filmed in a flat, dull way that brings nothing to the piece. When you start to wonder if the film is making continuity errors\u2014I swear it goes from overcast to sunny and back again a few times\u2014you know something\u2019s wrong.   As for Cusack, he\u2019s having a little bit of fun, but this is closer to the paycheck roles he often takes than it probably should have or could have been. As \u201cBlood Money\u201d becomes more and more about two dummies who really don\u2019t get\u00a0the woman they\u2019re fighting over, it becomes more interesting.

Mrs. Link, my high school Latin teacher, will be proud that I recall one of her daily phrases, \u201cpanem et circenses,\u201d which summarized the Roman formula for creating a docile population: Give them bread and circuses. A vision of present-day America is summoned up, its citizenry glutted with fast food and distracted by reality TV. How is the population expected to accept the violent sacrifice of 24 young lives a year? How many have died in our recent wars? The story centers on the two tributes from the dirt-poor District 12: Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). The 16-year-old girl hunts deer with bow and arrow to feed her family; he may be hunkier but seems no match in survival skills. They're both clean-cut, All-Panem types, and although one or both are eventually required to be dead, romance is a possibility. In contrast with these healthy young people, the ruling class in the Capitol are effete decadents. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), bedecked in gaudy costumery and laden with garish cosmetics, emcees the annual drawing for tributes, and the nation gets to know the finalists on a talk show hosted by Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), who suggests what Donald Trump might do with his hair if he had enough of it. \u00a0 The executive in charge is the gamemaker, Seneca (Wes Bentley), who has a beard so bizarrely designed that Satan would be envious. At the top of the society is the president (Donald Sutherland), a sagacious graybeard who harbors deep thoughts. In interviews, Sutherland has equated the younger generation with leftists and Occupiers. The old folks in the Capitol are no doubt a right-wing oligarchy. My conservative friends, however, equate the young with the Tea Party and the old with decadent Elitists. \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d like many parables, will show you exactly what you seek in it. Advertisement The scenes set in the Capitol and dealing with its peculiar characters have a completely different tone than the scenes of conflict in the Arena. The ruling class is painted in broad satire and bright colors. Katniss and the other tributes are seen in earth-toned realism; this character could be another manifestation, indeed, of Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar-nominated character Ree in \u201cWinter's Bone.\u201d The plot even explains why she's adept at bow and arrow.\u00a0 One thing I missed, however, was more self-awareness on the part of the tributes. As their names are being drawn from a fish bowl (!) at the Reaping, the reactions of the chosen seem rather subdued, considering the odds are 23-to-1 that they'll end up dead. Katniss volunteers to take the place of her 12-year-old kid sister, Prim (Willow Shields), but no one explicitly discusses the fairness of deadly combat between girl children and 18-year-old men. Apparently the jaded TV audiences of Panem have developed an appetite for barbarity. Nor do Katniss and Peeta reveal much thoughtfulness about their own peculiar position. \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d is an effective entertainment, and Jennifer Lawrence is strong and convincing in the central role. But the film leapfrogs obvious questions in its path, and avoids the opportunities sci-fi provides for social criticism; compare its world with the dystopias in \u201cGattaca\u201d or \u201cThe Truman Show.\u201d \u00a0Director Gary Ross and his writers (including the series' author, Suzanne Collins) obviously think their audience wants to see lots of hunting-and-survival scenes, and has no interest in people talking about how a cruel class system is using them. Well, maybe they're right. But I found the movie too long and deliberate as it negotiated the outskirts of its moral issues."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Funny People", "Review": "Stand-up comics feel compelled to make you laugh. They're like an obnoxious uncle, with better material. The competition is so fierce these days that most of them are pretty good. I laugh a lot. But unlike my feelings for Catherine Keener, for example, I don't find myself wishing they were my friends. I suspect they're laughing on the outside but gnashing their teeth on the inside. Judd Apatow would possibly agree with this theory. Recently I e-mailed him a bunch of questions and that was the only one he ignored. He was writing material for comics when he was a teenager, and his insights into the stand-up world inform \"Funny People,\" his new film that has a lot of humor and gnashing. It's centered on Adam Sandler's best performance, playing George Simmons, a superstar comic who learns he has a very short time to live. Advertisement He is without the resources to handle this news. He doesn't have the \"support group\" they say you need when you get sick. He's made a dozen hit movies and lives in opulence in a house overlooking Los Angeles but is so isolated, he doesn't even seem to have any vices for company. Adam Sandler modulates George's desperation in a perceptive, sympathetic performance; I realized here, as I did during his \"Punch Drunk Love,\" that he contains an entirely different actor than the one we're familiar with. His fans are perfectly happy with Sandler's usual persona, the passive-aggressive semi-simpleton. This other Sandler plays above and below that guy, and more deeply. \"Funny People\" is not simply about George Simmons' struggle with mortality. It sees that struggle within the hermetically sealed world of the stand-up comic, a secret society that has merciless rules, one of which is that even sincerity is a joke. \"No -- seriously!\" Here is a man without confidantes. When you depend on your agent for emotional support, you're probably only getting 10 percent as much as you need. On the circuit, George meets a hungry, ambitious kid named Ira Wright (Seth Rogen), who has written some good material. George hires him to write for him, then gives him a chance to open for him and then finds himself pouring out his worries to him. There was a girl once in George's past, named Laura (Leslie Mann). She was the one who got away. He encounters her again, now married to an obnoxious macho Aussie named Clarke (Eric Bana, playing him as a guy who seems to be weighing the possibility of hitting everyone he meets). George was once able to sort of confide in Laura, until success shut him down and now he finds he still sort of can. The thing about \"Funny People\" is that it's a real movie. That means carefully written dialogue and carefully placed supporting performances -- and it's about something. It could have easily been a formula film, and the trailer shamelessly tries to misrepresent it as one, but George Simmons learns and changes during his ordeal, and we empathize. Advertisement The film presents a new Seth Rogen, much thinner, dialed down, with more dimensions. Rogen was showing signs of forever playing the same buddy-movie co-star, but here we find that he, too, has another actor inside. So does Jason Schwartzman, who often plays vulnerable but here presents his character as the kind of successful rival you love to hate. Rogen and Leslie Mann find the right notes as George's impromptu support group. The plot doesn't blindly insist that George and Laura must find love; it simply suggests they could do better in their lives. Eric Bana makes a satisfactory comic villain, there is a rolling-around-on-the-lawn fight scene that's convincingly clumsy, and Mann mocks him with a spot-on Aussie accent (not the standard pleasant one, more of a bray). Apatow understands that every supporting actor has to pull his weight. The casting director who found him Torsten Voges to play George's doctor earned a day's pay. Voges is in some eerie, bizarre way convincing as a cheerful realist bringing terrible news: miles better than your stereotyped grim movie surgeon. After an enormously successful career as a producer, this is Apatow's third film as a director, after \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" and \"Knocked Up.\" Of him it can be said: He is a real director. He's still only 41. So here we go."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Fill the Void", "Review": "Claustrophobia isn't often considered a cinematic asset beyond tales of suspense and horror. But the award-winning Israeli drama \"Fill the Void,\" about a naive 18-year-old girl in an ultra-orthodox Hasidic community who dreams of finding the perfect match in an arranged marriage, capitalizes on its cloistered atmosphere. The compelling story is remarkably focused \u2014 even as it hints at such influences as Jane Austen, \"The Godfather\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof\" \u2014 and the emotional stakes lofty, both for the characters onscreen and, especially, the audience. Advertisement Most of the action takes place in cramped if homey domiciles in Tel Aviv, with only a few detours onto sidewalks or inside of a synagogue. Nearly the only modern-day intrusion into this hermetically sealed society is the booming techno-music beats of an outdoor Purim celebration, which are quickly muffled by the closing of a window.  With skilled deployment of long takes, lingering close-ups, repeated musical cues and meticulous lighting, director-writer Rama Burshtein \u2014 a Hasidic insider herself \u2014 never allows the intimacy to become too stifling, however. Instead, she vividly depicts a clannish culture that is likely to feel foreign and perhaps off-putting to generations that came of age in a progressive post-feminist era.  And yet the fair-minded will be able to discern the benefits of such a lifestyle, including strong extended family ties and a sense of a higher purpose, along with the drawbacks. In fact, Burshtein goes out of her way to show \u2014 as is the case in many old-world cultures \u2014 that despite initial appearances, in this society the fairer sex ultimately calls the shots.  Still, tradition still rules the roost. In this patriarchal society, married women hide their hair under a turban-like headpiece and often sit at a distance from the men as they drink their wine, chant, and conduct religious readings and rituals. Young females like Shira (played by delicate beauty Hadas Yaron with an uncompromised honesty that is both refreshing and frustrating) are indoctrinated into accepting that their mates will be chosen for them, though they do have the right to refuse. But as Shira and her mother (Irit Sheleg, whose Rivka is far stronger than her outward demeanor suggests) stalk possible suitors at grocery stores, a tragedy perhaps too conveniently upends their plans. The family's older daughter, the 9-months-pregnant Esther, suddenly drops dead and leaves her newborn son and a grieving husband behind. Rivka goes into manipulation mode, pushing Shira to marry her brother-in-law, Yochay (Yiftach Klein), to prevent him from whisking her grandson off to Belgium, where an eager-to-wed widow awaits. Advertisement Suddenly, Shira, an attractive adolescent who ambles along in life when she isn't playing the accordion (not the most self-aware person, she responds to a potential beau when asked why she chose the instrument: \"I can't play anything else\") is forced to make a difficult choice. Is she obligated to take her sister's place alongside a man who is several years her senior and raise his and Esther's child as her own? Or does she carve out her own path while denying her mother's wish?  Matrimony gets little respect from Hollywood these days, save for the bawdy, farcical variety found in \"Bridesmaids\" and the execrable \"The Big Wedding.\" \"Fill the Void,\" however, has more in common with a '50s Doris Day comedy in which wedlock is a woman's crowning achievement and spinsterhood is to be pitied. Yet Burshtein wisely individualizes each case in some way, including that of Shira's disabled single aunt, who dons a wifely turban to \"avoid questions.\"  The filmmaker also lets her female characters demonstrate their impact on the community in less obvious ways than the male figures. It is no accident that women are often framed by gauzy white fabric, such as curtains and veils, illuminated by rays of light \u2014 suggesting the presence of a spiritual force \u2014 while the men conduct their business in dark, shadowy confines.  With such close quarters, \"Fill the Void\" is thankfully blessed with memorable faces, especially Yaron's, whose mesmerizing features \u2014 including her \"Now, Voyager\"-esque untamed brows \u2014 recall the virginal heroines of the silent era. Another visual plus: a sweater wardrobe that is surprisingly fashion-forward. Meanwhile, in contrast to the doughy awkward bachelors in the running for Shira's hand, Klein's handsome visage \u2014 reminiscent of a more refined Sacha Baron Cohen \u2014 shines through his beard and tendrils. In a chaste film with neck-to-toe costumes, there is a surprising amount of heat displayed between Yochay and Esther as well as \u2014 rather flirtatiously \u2014 with Yochay and Shira.  Gentle humor creeps in occasionally, such as when an elder rabbi is required to give an insistent lonely older woman advice on buying a new stove. The setting might be shut off from outside influences, but its ending leaves the door open for interpretation and post-viewing discussion \u2014 just as the best sort of movie-going experiences often do."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Wolfpack", "Review": "The story behind \u201cThe Wolfpack,\u201d one of this year\u2019s buzziest\r\nSundance docs, is one of that blessed event in filmmaking\u2014blind luck.\u00a0Director Crystal Moselle was walking down an NYC street one day when\r\nshe saw six young men in suits and sunglasses coming in the other direction.\r\nThey passed by her and Moselle had the instinct to turn around and ask them their\r\nstory. And what a story she heard. The Angulo brothers\u2014six young men with\r\nsimilar features and long black hair\u2014brought her up to their tiny apartment,\r\nshared with a shy mother and aggressive father. Moselle learned that the Angulos\r\nhad barely been allowed to leave this apartment over the course of their entire\r\nexistence, raised in a secluded, near-cult family, allegedly driven by\r\nfather Oscar\u2019s fear of the real world. With an abusive father and no contact\r\nwith the outside world, the Angulos became obsessed with feature films, writing\r\nout scripts for flicks like \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d and \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d by pausing the DVDs and then\r\nreenacting them in fine detail. Film became their only portal to the real world, their way to\r\nexpress their fears and desires. And Moselle caught these boys just as they\r\nwere moving from a world lit by a television tube to one with sunlight. Advertisement Clearly, Moselle had instant affection for the Angulo boys.\r\nIt\u2019s hard not to. They are remarkably sweet and gentle, and the sadness in\r\ntheir eyes, especially the older ones, when they discuss their heartbreaking\r\nupbringing and fear of the real world is the kind that makes you want to give\r\nthem a hug. Early in \u201cThe Wolfpack,\u201d the older boys ask if she got up to their\r\napartment OK, as if something bad would happen to her in the lobby, and are excited to cook\r\ndinner for their special guest. It\u2019s clear from Moselle\u2019s verit\u00e9 style, in\r\nwhich she doesn\u2019t often seem to ask follow-up questions but let the boys come\r\nto their own emotional conclusions, that she was very concerned about these\r\nyoung men, as anybody would be. But the arms-length approach can be\r\nfrustrating. There are times when the Angulos seem to be directing \u201cThe\r\nWolfpack\u201d more than Moselle, and it\u2019s an incredible story that would have benefited\r\nfrom a surer hand. Despite the sense sometimes that Moselle isn\u2019t driving \u201cWolfpack\u201d\r\nin the way needed to make it truly work, she undeniably finds some beautiful\r\nmoments in the trajectory of the Angulos, although they are sometimes so\r\nfleeting as to frustrate when they aren\u2019t further developed. The most striking\r\nmoment comes when an Angulo says that \u201cWe\r\nwere frightened kids\u2026that\u2019s one of the first memories I have,\u201d when\r\ndiscussing the abusive Oscar, who one claims ended every fight with mom with a\r\nslap. Moselle then cuts to a figure of Mukunda, the most reflective of the\r\nboys, in a detailed Batman costume, before reenacting \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d Do the\r\nboys relate to macho, male-driven films because they haven\u2019t had a decent male\r\nrole model in their lives? Are they drawn to the melancholy of Nolan\u2019s take on\r\nthe character because it reflects their own?  Much of \u201cThe Wolfpack\u201d is undeniably moving, especially as\r\nthe boys come out into the real world, frightened and unsure of themselves.\r\nThey see \u201cbig f**king trees\u201d and\r\ncompare them \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d They see \u201cThe Fighter\u201d and are happy that\r\ntheir ticket money will go to Christian Bale. There\u2019s a na\u00efve, heartwarming\r\napproach to the power of cinema in \u201cThe Wolfpack\u201d that clearly appealed to the\r\ncinephiles in Park City.  Could Moselle have found a way to make this incredible story\r\ninto an incredible film? Part of the problem may be that she came upon the\r\nAngulos at the time they were emerging from their near imprisonment and that\r\nmade her hesitant to pry into their pasts for fear of placing blocks in what seems like a road to recovery, as anybody would be. When mom says\r\nthat she grew up in the Midwest and thinks public school \u201csocialization\u201d is not\r\nthat good, anybody would almost feel impolite to pry further into her\r\nbackground or the falsity of that belief. And yet that\u2019s what separates great documentaries\r\nfrom good ones.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Revenant", "Review": "Great film has the power to convey the unimaginable. We sit\r\nin the comfort of a darkened theater or our living room and watch protagonists\r\nsuffer through physical and emotional pain that most of us can\u2019t really\r\ncomprehend. Too often, these endurance tests feel manipulative or, even worse,\r\nfalse. We\u2019re smart enough to \u201csee the strings\u201d being pulled, and the actor and\r\nset never fades away into the character and condition. What\u2019s remarkable about\r\nAlejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s \u201cThe Revenant\u201d is how effectively it transports\r\nus to another time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece of\r\nvisual art. You don\u2019t just watch \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d you experience it. You\r\nwalk out of it exhausted, impressed with the overall quality of the filmmaking\r\nand a little more grateful for the creature comforts of your life. Advertisement I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith set their tone early,\r\nstaging a breathtaking assault on a group of fur trappers by Native Americans,\r\nportrayed not just as \u201cenemies\u201d but a violent force of nature. While a few\r\ndozen men are preparing to pack up and move on to their next stop in the great\r\nAmerican wilderness, a scene out of \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d unfolds. Arrows pierce air\r\nand flesh as the few surviving men flee to a nearby boat. It turns out that the\r\ntribe is seeking a kidnapped daughter of its leader, and will kill anyone who\r\ngets in their way. At the same time, we learn that one of the trappers, Hugh\r\nGlass (Leonardo DiCaprio) has a half-Native American son named Hawk (Forrest\r\nGoodluck).  Low on men and hunted, the expedition\r\nleader Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) orders that their crew return to its\r\nbase, a fort in the middle of this snowy wilderness. John Fitzgerald (Tom\r\nHardy) disagrees, and the seeds of dissent are planted. He doesn\u2019t trust Henry,\r\nand he doesn\u2019t like Glass. In the midst of these discussions, Glass is away\r\nfrom the crew one day when he\u2019s brutally attacked by a bear\u2014the sequence is,\r\nwithout hyperbole, one of the most stunning things I\u2019ve seen on film in a long\r\ntime, heart-racing and terrifying. Glass barely survives the attack.\r\nIt seems highly unlikely that he\u2019ll make it back to the base. With increasingly\r\ndangerous conditions and a tribe of killers on their heels, they agree to split\r\nup. Most of the men will go back first while Fitzgerald, Hawk and a young man\r\nnamed Bridger (Will Poulter) will get a sizable fee to stay with Glass until he\r\ndies, giving him as much comfort as possible in his final days and the\r\nburial he deserves. Of course, Fitzgerald quickly tires of having to watch a man\r\nhe doesn\u2019t care about die. He kills Hawk in front of an immobile Glass and then\r\nbasically buries Hugh alive. As Bridger and Fitzgerald head back, Glass\r\nessentially rises from the dead (the word revenant means \u201cone that returns\r\nafter death or a long absence\u201d) and begins his quest for vengeance. With broken\r\nbones, no food, and miles to go, he pulls himself through snow and across\r\nmountains, seeking the man who killed his son. He is practically a ghost, a man\r\nwho has come as close to death as one possibly can but is unwilling to go to\r\nthe other side until justice is done. Advertisement The bulk of \u201cThe Revenant\u201d consists of this torturous\r\njourney, as Glass regains his strength and gets closer to home through sheer\r\nforce of will. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s Oscar-winning cinematographer for \u201cBirdman,\u201d Emmanuel Lubezki (who\r\nalso took a trophy for \u201cGravity\u201d the year before and could easily make it three\r\nin a row for this work) shoots \u201cThe Revenant\u201d in a way that conveys both the\r\nharrowing conditions and the artistry of his vision. The sky seems to go on\r\nforever; the horizon is neverending. He works in a color palette provided by\r\nnature, and yet enhanced. The snow seems whiter, the sky bluer. Many of his\r\nshots, especially in times of great danger like the opening attack and the bear\r\nscene, are unbroken\u2014placing us in the middle of the action. At other times, Lubezki\u2019s choices recall his work on \u201cThe\r\nTree of Life,\u201d especially in scenes in the second half when Glass\u2019s journey\r\ngets more mystical. And that\u2019s where the film falters a bit.\u00a0I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u00a0doesn\u2019t\r\nquite have a handle on those second-half scenes and the 156-minute running time\r\nbegins to feel self-indulgent as the film loses focus. When it centers on\r\nthe conditions and the tale of a man unwilling to die, it\u2019s mesmerizing. I just\r\nthink there\u2019s a tighter version, especially in the mid-section, that would be\r\neven more effective. About that man: So much has been made of this film being DiCaprio\u2019s\r\n\u201cOverdue Oscar\u201d shot that I feel like his actual work here will be undervalued.\r\nMake no mistake. Should he win, it will not be some \u201cLifetime Achievement\u201d win\r\nas we\u2019ve seen in the past for actors who we all thought should have won for\r\nanother film (Paul Newman, Al Pacino, etc.). He\u2019s completely committed in every terrifying moment, pushing himself further than he ever has\r\nbefore as an actor. Even just the physical demands of this protagonist would\r\nhave been enough to break a lot of lesser actors, but it\u2019s the way in which\r\nDiCaprio captures his internal fortitude that\u2019s captivating\u2014his body may be\r\nbroken, but we believe he is unwilling to give up.  Advertisement The minimal supporting cast is good, and it\u2019s nice to see\r\nGleeson continue to have an incredible 2015 (also in \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d \u201cEx Machina\u201d\r\nand \u201cStar Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens\u201d). Tom Hardy is less effective,\r\noften going a little too heavy on the tics (wide eyes, shot up-close), but I\r\nthink that\u2019s a fault of the direction and not one of our best actors. In the\r\nend, this is DiCaprio\u2019s film through and through, and he nails every\r\nchallenging beat, literally throwing himself into this character that\r\ndemands more of him physically than any other before.\u00a0 What would you do for vengeance? What conditions could you\r\nsurmount to get it? Or would you just give up? Our favorite films often drop\r\nquestions like these into our lives, allowing us to appreciate the world a\r\nlittle differently than before we saw them. \u201cThe Revenant\u201d has this power. It\r\nlingers. It hangs in the back of your mind like the best classic parables of\r\nman vs. nature. It will stay there for quite some time."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Witch", "Review": "\"The Witch,\" a period drama/horror film by first-time writer/director Robert Eggers, tellingly advertises itself as \"a New England folktale\" instead of a fairy tale. Fairy tales are, at heart, parables that prescribe moral values. \"The Witch,\" a feminist narrative that focuses on an American colonial family as they undergo what seems to be an otherworldly curse, is more like a sermon. Sermons pose questions that use pointedly allegorical symbols to make us reconsider our lives, just as one character uses the Book of Job to understand her role in her family (more on Job shortly). But \"The Witch\" is not a morality play in a traditional sense. It's an ensemble drama about a faithless family on the verge of self-destruction. And it is about women, and the patriarchal stresses that lead to their disenfranchisement.  Advertisement For a while, it is unclear which character\u00a0is exactly the focus of \"The Witch.\" It's probably not grieving mother Katherine (Kate Dickie), though Eggers gives ample consideration to her mourning\u00a0of infant son Samuel, who has disappeared under unusual circumstances. And it's definitely not Katherine's mischievous young twins Jonas and Mercy (Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger, respectively),\u00a0though Mercy does often speak for her and her brother's inability to understand how the world works after their family is banished to a foreboding forest by a nearby colony. The film's main protagonist might be William (Ralph Ineson), Katherine's troubled husband. Or it could\u00a0be her eldest son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), a young man desperate\u00a0to defend his father from his mother's frustration.\u00a0 But more often than not, \"The Witch\" concerns Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), the eldest of Katherine and William's five children. Thomasin undergoes puberty under the\u00a0mistrustful eyes of her family, but realistically, they're not too concerned with her when\u00a0crops are failing, money is scarce, and Samuel is missing. Still, Thomasin absorbs the brunt of her family's anxieties: her younger siblings look to her for comfort, but she balks at the added pressure, especially after her mother makes her do more chores than the rest of her family members. There are other subplots in \"The Witch,\" but all roads eventually lead to Thomasin. That's the dark beauty of Eggers's expansive story: it's not just about the marginalized presence of women in a male-dominated microcosm, but the harsh conditions that can, even under extremely isolated circumstances, lead women to resentment, and crippling self-doubt. \"The Witch\" is, in that sense, an anti-parable. Eggers eventually leads Thomasin out of the woods, but he takes his time in clearing her path. The result sometimes feels like an imaginary Harold Pinter-scripted version of \"The Crucible,\" since it follows desperate, lonely\u00a0souls who do everything\u2014set animal traps, milk goats, till the fields, do laundry\u2014to avoid thinking about what's really troubling them. It takes a while for Thomasin's clan to even consider that their problems are caused by witch, or demonic enchantment. But it eventually happens. Before that, there are only signs and portents, particularly evil-looking animals: a tetchy\u00a0goat, a twitchy\u00a0hare, and some talkative\u00a0crows. Eventually, Thomasin's family personify their fears of nature, a gnawing uncertainty that is predictably gendered as feminine. And suddenly, the family's day-to-day troubles\u2014almost all of which stem from the fact that their land seems cursed\u2014takes the form of a fairy tale witch. Advertisement Which brings us back to Job. In the Book of Job, God hurts Job in order to test his\u00a0faith. The reader knows that God exists, and has a divine, or perhaps just Mysterious, reason for trying Job. But until Job's body is plagued by God, he doesn't question that there is a reason for his torment. The same is basically true of William and his family. Until events\u00a0lead his family to start clawing at each other's throats, he goes about his business as best he can. As a result, when you watch \"The Witch,\" you often don't seem to know what the film is about. But\u00a0the film's title is a big clue: this is a fantasy about empowerment, albeit through unorthodox methods.\u00a0 I've talked a lot about what \"The Witch\" is about without mentioning how well it's about it. That's partly because the film is so consistently engrossing that I surrendered to it early on. Eggers' hyper-mannered camerawork draws you in by evoking Johannes Vermeer's portraits and the landscape paintings of Andrew Wyeth (there's also an overt reference to one of Francisco Goya's more famous\u00a0paintings, but I can't tell you which one for fear of ruining a surprise). The complex sound design and controlled editing also help establish a mood that is (paradoxically) both inviting and somber. \"The Witch\" draws you in so well that you won't realize its creators have been broadcasting exactly where they're taking you."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Elles", "Review": "\"Elles\" has a surprisingly deep performance in a disappointingly shallow movie. The performance, acute and brave, is by Juliette Binoche as a Parisian writer researching a magazine article about young prostitutes in the city.

Yes, her husband is an unemotional louse, and her two sons are a trial, but isn't it insulting to imply that her bright and independent character is simply selling out? Nobody said marriage was easy. Advertisement Binoche is Anne, who has placed ads in order to contact part-time call girls. The movie backs into this scenario via her interviews with Charlotte (Anais Demoustier) and Alicja (Joanna Kulig). Both girls are frank about their motivations: Charlotte wants a nicer apartment, and Alicja, from Poland, likes the more expensive clothes she can now afford. Neither seems traumatized by her experience; indeed, to Anne, they seem happier than she is. Anne's sessions with them eventually lead to confidences and friendship; one ends with a hug. The director and co-writer, Malgoska Szumowska, intercuts these interviews with scenes of the two women servicing clients, which can look ever so much more pleasant than shots of Anne masturbating on her bathroom floor and then breaking into tears. The sex scenes are explicit enough to earn an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, a rating so rare I can't recall the last time I encountered one; films like \"Elles\" are usually released these days as \"unrated.\" Prostitution is an occupation both young women went into willingly, and their upscale clients and prices distinguish them from more desperate hookers. Still, \"Elles\" includes a particularly unpleasant scene involving one sadistic client; it is after Anne hears this described that she masturbates, suggesting \u2014 what? That's she's a masochist and was turned on? I don't think so, but the film doesn't provide a better explanation. Anne's home life centers around her distant and demanding husband and their sons, Florent and Stephane. The film begins on a day when Anne is racing to meet her magazine deadline and yet is expected to prepare and serve a gourmet meal to her husband's boss and some business associates. Florent, an older teenager openly contemptuous of his parents and their marriage, drifts in a cloud of marijuana. Stephane, around 12, is addicted to his generation's drug of choice, video games.  Anne can't seem to speak to any of the men in her family. Indeed, her only good relationships are with the prostitutes. Binoche brings to these scenes an intimacy and ability to confide that transforms them from what could have been a more exploitative tone. There are moments of truth, including a bleak closing scene with her husband.  Binoche makes a strong impression, but \"Elles\" seems inadequate to her character and forces simplistic conclusions when more complex ones are needed."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Campaign", "Review": "\"The Campaign\" made me think of \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" if it had been written by the Onion staff. It involves a Congressional election in North Carolina in which both campaigns are reduced to gaffes and dirty tricks, until the tide is turned at the last moment by an uncontrolled outburst of honesty. Will Ferrell stars as Cam Brady, the four-term incumbent who runs basically because he likes being a congressman. Zach Galifianakis is Marty Huggins, the doofus who runs the local tourism board and is backed by billionaire brothers who want to \"insource\" cheap labor by buying the district and then selling it at a profit to China. Advertisement The movie is technically nonpartisan, although there is no mistaking the billionaire Motch brothers (John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd). They're clearly intended to be the Koch brothers, architects of changes in our laws about political contributions that allow corporations to pour fortunes into campaigns. The Motches have no particular ideology except that it is a good thing for them to get richer. Candidates Brady and Huggins stand for the Flag, our men in uniform and Jesus \u2014 although in a debate, when Huggins challenges Brady to recite the Lord's Prayer, he has to improvise.  The movie uses their campaign as a showcase of political scandals that have become familiar in both parties, missing only one: Neither candidate is caught adopting a wider stance in an airport restroom. Brady tops that, however, by seducing Higgins' tubby wife, Mitzi (Sarah Baker), filming it with his phone and then posting their rumpy-pumpy as a video that goes viral. This is not so much a campaign strategy as an outburst of savage rage, but it does give him a two-point bump in the polls. The Ferrell character has a John Edwards hairstyle, and also borrows from Ferrell's \"Saturday Night Live\" performances as George W. Bush. If Galifianakis is inspired by anybody, it may be Newt Gingrich, although his Huggins is way too clueless to be Newt. During the course of the contest, he becomes inflamed with new insights, however, and is coached by campaign manager Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott), who the Motches send in to provide him with a makeover so complete it even replaces the family dogs. Brady's campaign manager is Mitch (Jason Sudeikis), who wants Brady to win primarily because he wants to hang onto his own cushy job. His loyalty runs deeper, however, than that of Brady's blond poster wife, Rose (Katherine LaNasa), who will put up with a lot but draws the line when her husband posts the porn of himself online. Brady also has a fondness for emailing photos of his penis; that's the kind of detail we wouldn't have been able to believe until \u2014 well, it happened. The movie has been directed by Jay Roach, who seems to draw both from the broad schtick of his \"Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery\" and \"Meet the Fockers\" movies and the political outrage of his \"Recount\" and \"Game Change.\" He should get some credit for guiding both Ferrell and Galifianakis in playing characters who are at a certain distance from their usual screen personas. Would a Republican enjoy this movie as much as a Democrat? Possibly. Party affiliations mean nothing to the characters, nor does the plot approach them. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "My Afternoons With Marguerite", "Review": "Germain is a handyman in a sloppy flannel shirt and overalls, overweight and hulking. Margueritte is a little (85 pounds) old (95 years) lady. They meet on a park bench, where both know that exactly 14 pigeons hang out there, and both recognize them by sight.  Germain may be a hulk (he's played by Gerard Depardieu, who certainly is). But he is gentle and has a good heart, despite having been treated with cruelty by a mother who still survives to make his life miserable. He lives in a small trailer parked near his childhood home and lovingly tends his garden, where his mother displays sporadic violence against leeks. Advertisement Margueritte is played by Gisele Casadesus, now 97, who made her first film in 1934 as a member of Comedie Francaise. She is so slight and fragile she reminds Germain of a glass figure. She once worked for the World Health Organization, now lives in a retirement home with her beloved books. Germain believes he cannot read. Actually, we discover later, he was taught to read but never taught to have a shred of self-confidence. She begins to read to him \u2014 The Plague by Camus \u2014 and he is an ideal listener. With her as his catalyst, he makes slow steps toward self-esteem. This happens in an improbably sweet film that will strike many as too upbeat. Germain is cuddled by his adorable bus-driver girlfriend Annette (Sophie Guillemin), and pals around with his buddies at a local cafe. He suffers through flashbacks to his unhappy childhood, but seems on the whole serene. He loves Annette but he declares himself \"in love\" with Margueritte.  So are we, a little. She is bright-eyed and high-spirited, and never overplays the heart-tugging. The director, Jean Becker, is the son of the great French noir director Jacques Becker, who was 8 when Gisele Casadesus was born. There's history here. The happy ending lays it on too thick, but what the hell: In for a dime, in for a dollar. Besides, the movie started me re-reading The Plague."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Band of Robbers", "Review": "This movie, written and directed by Aaron Nee and Adam Nee, opens with the \u201cNotice\u201d from\r\nMark Twain\u2019s \u201cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d You know (well, I assume you\r\nknow), the bit about \u201cPersons attempting to find a motive in this narrative ... \u201d\r\nand so on. The thing an English teacher would tell you was ironic or satirical\r\nor something. At this point you might be thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s this\r\nmovie called \u2018Band of Robbers\u2019 got to do with Huck Finn anyway?\u201d and soon\r\nenough it answers your question.  Advertisement It\u2019s a story of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, only it\u2019s\r\ntransposed to the present day, set in some unspecified sun-drenched place that\u2019s\r\nnot the American South as depicted in Twain\u2019s work. And, Huck and Tom are now\r\nyoung men. And the \u201cband of robbers\u201d title isn\u2019t from out of nowhere, the\r\nphrase does appear in \u201cAdventures of Tom Sawyer\u201d in a scene where its title\r\nmischief-maker suggests the formation of \u201cTom Sawyer\u2019s gang.\u201d  Does this sound to you like a good idea? If yes, maybe\r\nyou\u2019ll enjoy this movie more than I did because I think it\u2019s a bad idea that\u2019s\r\nbadly done in at least two ways, maybe three, but however many there are\r\nthey\u2019re all fatal. The movie opens with a flashback of Tom and Huck as boys,\r\nwith Huck reminiscing \u201cTom was the closest thing to a real family I had. He saw\r\na world where we were just one adventure away from all our problems\r\ndisappearing.\u201d This sounds neither like Twain\u2019s voice for Huck Finn, narrator,\r\nor Twain\u2019s own close-third-person prose as used in \u201cTom Sawyer.\u201d Get used to\r\nthat. In this film\u2019s universe, adult Huck (Kyle Gallner) is a soulful and perhaps\r\nreluctant reprobate coming off of a prison stint, while Tom (co-director Adam\r\nNee) is a cop who uses his position as a cover for trouble-making, all of it,\r\nin this case, centered around treasure-seeking. The treasure-seeking is of\r\ncourse a theme in Twain\u2019s original tales, and the film\u2019s first half-hour finds\r\nTom engineering a pawnshop robbery scheme that plays out as a very poor\r\nimitation of Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d Nee\u2019s vocal inflections even take\r\non a touch of Owen Wilson during the attempted comedy of Tom explaining his\r\nmaster plan to his dumber-than-he-is accomplices. The actual robbery is\r\ncomplicated when Tom gets saddled with a new partner on his beat the very day\r\nof the robbery. She\u2019s the daughter \u2026 wait for it \u2026 of a powerful figure in the town \u2026 yes \u2026 it\u2019s\r\nBecky Thatcher, played here by Melissa Benoist, now TV\u2019s \u201cSupergirl,\u201d which may\r\nend up the sole reason this movie winds up being cited any time anywhere. Yes,\r\nHannibal Buress is also in the cast, but he\u2019s so relentlessly poorly used you\r\ntend to forget that, or want to forget it, for his sake.\u00a0  In any event, once the poor impersonation of \u201cBottle Rocket\u201d\r\nis over, the Nees turn back to Twain. Not his prose style, or his humor, but\r\nrather his plotting and his use of racial stereotypes/conventions. The\r\nnew-fangled character of Injun Joe, played by Stephen Lang, who must have\r\ngotten tired of cooling his heels waiting for those new \u201cAvatar\u201d pictures to\r\nstart shooting, is given a whole new \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d bag. This is\r\nproblematic, not because it\u2019s politically objectionable, but because it sucks.\r\nOther innovations include the actual cave where the problematic climax of\r\nTwain\u2019s work occurs changing into a motel called \u201cThe Cavern.\u201d The Nees clearly\r\nwant the liberties they take with Twain to constitute some sort of commentary\r\non the work and its place in American culture, but their observations aren\u2019t\r\nparticularly smart or well-constructed or well-executed. Not that they would\r\nhave necessarily been better off just making another bro-crime comedy-drama,\r\nbut \u2026 well, I don\u2019t know what they might have been better off doing, frankly.\r\n\u201cBand of Robbers\u201d just plain doesn\u2019t work, to the extent that I\u2019m almost\r\nregretful that the attempted schoolroom bans on Twain\u2019s work weren\u2019t more effective over the years, as they\r\nmight have spared me watching it."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Frownland", "Review": "\"Frownland\" is like a shriek for help. It centers on an extraordinary performance that plays like an unceasing panic attack. To call it uncompromising is to wish for a better word. It doesn't ask us to like its central character; after all, no one in the film does. I don't think he likes himself. The character is Keith (Dore Mann). He is in his late 20s, a chain-smoker, a shabby dresser, a door-to-door salesman for dubious coupon booklets benefitting multiple sclerosis. His girlfriend, Laura (Mary Wall), arrives sobbing at his tiny room, sleeps with her face to the wall, sticks him with a push-pin. Advertisement I feel sympathy for Keith, but I wouldn't want to spend time with him. He has a punishing manner of speech that involves starting sentences again and again, blurting out impassioned and inarticulate appeals, overwhelming his listeners. You can see his jaw working as he gathers the courage to speak again. He is constantly wiping his face with his hand. He makes his only friend desperate to get rid of him. His flatmate is jobless and can't pay his share. Keith's room is a single bed on the left and a row of kitchen implements on the right, with a 2-foot aisle between. His flatmate, Charles (Paul Grimstad), agrees to pay the electric bill but Keith doesn't trust him. This sets up a devastating verbal assault from Charles -- who in fact never pays the bill. His \"friend\" Sandy (David Sandholm) doesn't want Keith to visit and tricks him into leaving. When he fails at his hopeless door-to-door job, his boss, Carmine (Carmine Marino), who drives a crew of salesmen in his van, asks him how he'd like to walk home. His very way of speaking to people invites a \"no.\" One curiosity is that the film leaves Keith for an extended scene involving Charles taking a test for a job application. I can see how the idea of testing people might apply to Keith, but otherwise this plays as a digression. Then we return to Keith with a harrowing scene where he is mocked by drunks at a disco. Incredibly, even here, Mann's work never goes over the top. We believe at every moment that this suffering creature is really feeling what he seems to feel, really saying what he needs to say. It is easy to imagine the performance going wrong, but it doesn't. Now why would you want to see this film? Most readers of this review probably wouldn't. I'm writing for the rest of us. It is a rebirth of the need for expression that inspired the American independent movement in the first place, 50 years ago. It was written, directed and edited by Ronald Bronstein, who had a crew of one cameraman, one soundman and one grip. It has not been picked up for distribution; he is distributing it himself at shrines to outsider cinema. Yet the film has gained a foothold. It won a special jury prize at the important SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas. It won a Gotham Award from the Independent Feature Project in New York. To give you an idea of the challenge it presents, the New York Times praised it, but it was hated by Film Threat, \"Hollywood's Indie Voice.\" Advertisement Such reactions are inspired by Dore Mann's performance, which in intensity equals Peter Greene's work in Lodge Kerrigan's \"Clean, Shaven\" (1993). Indeed, Kerrigan is one of the champions of the film. What Mann does is not caricature, not \"performance,\" not contrived. It is full throttle all the way with insecurity, needfulness, loneliness, mistrust, desperation, self-hate, apology and despair. \"Frownland\" has been described as a test for audiences. There will be walkouts. But it doesn't set out to alienate its viewers; its only purpose is to do justice to Keith by showing him as he is. I will not forget him."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Swiss Army Man", "Review": "One thing you definitely can't say about \"Swiss Army Man\" is \"Oh, not that again.\"\u00a0 This film from the writer-director team of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (who are billed as The Daniels)\u00a0starts on a deserted island, with a depressed man named Hank (Paul Dano) interrupting a suicide attempt to check out what he thinks is a shipwreck survivor (Daniel Radcliffe) who's washed ashore nearby. The man is dead, and very flatulent. Hank doesn't manage to bring him back to life, but his resuscitation attempts make the corpse spew fresh water from its mouth like an old fashioned hand-pumped faucet and increases his expenditure of gas.\u00a0 Advertisement Hank rides the corpse through the waves like a jet ski until they both make landfall, then carries him on his back through the forest like Luke Skywalker carrying Yoda, talking to him about life, love, and what it means to be human. The corpse, whom Hank meaningfully dubs \"Manny,\" has the power of speech, but has forgotten everything, so Hank tells him everything he knows. Manny's relationship to Hank is that of a trusting young child and his father, though not exclusively. At various points in \"Swiss Army Man,\" the central duo could be likened to buddies in a buddy picture, boyfriend-girlfriend, Pinocchio and Gepetto, and partners in an extended outdoor theatrical improv exercise. One of the longest sequences is set in a cave whose border forms a proscenium arch across the screen; in time the men build an elaborate \"set\" there, out of garbage, and re-enact a key moment in a man's life. The title describes the way that Hank discovers and utilizes Manny's \r\ndifferent abilities: in addition to being a gas factory, a jet ski and a\r\n water pump, he's a \"gun\" who can spit objects at high speed, an \"axe\" \r\nwho can chop things with his arm, and more. You're always aware of the various component parts that fed the filmmakers' imaginations (mainly other movies, music videos, and perhaps children's books and fairy tales), but \"Swiss Army Man\" is such a Frankenstein-like amalgam of bits and pieces\u2014interesting that of all the literary comparisons I could have made, I jumped to a novel about a man trying to reanimate dead tissue; this film sure does a number on your subconscious!\u2014that you can't fairly describe it as being entirely \"like\" any one thing. The\u00a0trailer-for-itself editing style of some sections, coupled with the religiously inflected and chant-driven score (by Manchester Orchestra's Andy Hull and Robert McDowell) and shots of sunlight streaming down through forest canopies, make it feel like \"Terrence Malick's Weekend at Bernie's.\" There are moments that evoke Spike Jonze's film version of \"Where the Wild Things Are\" and \"Peter Pan\" and the collected works of David Lynch and the Pleasure Island scenes of \"Pinocchio\" and so on.  The film is elastic, transmogrifying from a psychological drama into a \r\nliterally excremental comedy and then a hard-edged survival picture, occasionally \r\nembracing the cosmic and turning into an emo hipster answer to \"2001: A \r\nSpace Odyssey.\" And yet the emotional temperatures of the movie fluctuate so intuitively from moment to moment, and the situations and editing choices along with them, that there's ultimately no point trying to deal with \"Swiss Army Man\" on any terms but its own.\u00a0 It's common for critics to describe a film as \"dreamlike,\" but what does that word mean? Most of the time it means that a movie is filled with strange and not necessarily realistic imagery and situations, or that the storytelling prizes incidents and moments of raw feeling. \"Swiss Army Man\" fits all of those descriptions, but it's dreamlike in a deeper sense: like a dream, its structural logic is entirely emotional. Notice, for instance, how the rhythm of the cutting is attuned to Manny and Hank, speeding up when they are talking quickly and slowing down when we're observing them in repose. Notice, too,\u00a0how the movie uses music: sometimes Hank or Manny or both will start singing along with the score, while other times the score will seem to be taking cues from them, even listening to them and following their lead. (John Williams' score for \"Jurassic Park\"\u2014not coincidentally a Frankenstein story\u2014gets quoted more than once.) \u00a0 Advertisement The performances are just as supple. Dano's earnestness, which has been used for unsettling effect in some films, is showcased straightforwardly here, so that Hank seems a damaged but good man working through a personal catastrophe. (The whole film could be his dream.) Radcliffe's work takes Manny far beyond one-joke status. Though the performance is mainly kindhearted and guileless, suggesting a child in an adult's body, there are times when Radcliffe's delivery is so anguished, like a victim of a severe neurological trauma teaching himself to speak or walk again, that it's painful to watch. Even the most outrageous, self-consciously broad touches, such as the numerous fart jokes, have the crystalline feeling of situations encountered in a dream. Certain moments in dreams seem very silly or very stupid when you describe them to others afterward, but when you're experiencing them, they're intense, maybe not funny at all, or so purely emotional that they rip through any ironic detachment you carried into your slumber and affect you in a piercingly direct way, as a young child might react to twists in a bedtime story that a parent made up on the spot.\u00a0 The movie is not as endearing as it sometimes wants to be, it strains too hard to wow us at times, the introduction of a \"seize the day\" message reduces it, and in the end there may not be not enough plot, or situations\u2014or whatever you want to call the film's amalgamation of incidents\u2014to justify a feature length running time. (Like some dreams, it has several endings when one would have been plenty.) But \"Swiss Army Man\" is still mightily impressive for its\u00a0commitment\u00a0to its vision and its refusal to explain itself.\u00a0The Daniels have made a film that's at once a labor of love and a work of sheer arrogant nerve, one that is as likely to be described as a classic, an ambitious misfire, and one of the worst films ever made by any three people who see it together. How many movies can\u00a0you\u00a0say that about? Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Pay the Ghost", "Review": "Nicolas Cage is often accused of taking parts that don\u2019t\r\nchallenge his undeniable range, especially in recent years as the \"paycheck parts\" have piled up.

Looking over Cage\u2019s resume, I considered the\r\nfollowing phrase carefully: \u201cPay the Ghost,\u201d out in very limited release today,\r\nis a new low for Nicolas Cage. Just when you thought he couldn\u2019t get any more apathetic\r\nabout a role, he pops up in this lazy, boring retread of \u201cInsidious\u201d that even\r\nhis most diehard fans should ignore.  Advertisement Based on a novella by Tim Lebbon, \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d stars Cage\r\nas Mike Lawford, an English teacher who drops references to Lovecraft and Johann\r\nWolfgang von Goethe just so you get the impression that Dan Kay\u2019s screenplay\r\ncomes with great literary aspirations. (Spoiler: It does not.) Lawford is married to Kristen (Sarah\r\nWayne Callies), and the two have a child named Charlie (Jack Fulton). Of\r\ncourse, Mike is a distant dad, not around enough as he tries to earn tenure at\r\nthe university where he teaches. On Halloween, Lawford finally gets tenure, and comes home to celebrate with his family. He even\r\nconvinces his wife to let him take Charlie to a late-night Halloween parade (do\r\nthose things really happen in NYC in 2015?) Charlie, who has been having odd visions\r\nof late, asks dad if they \u201ccan pay the\r\nghost,\u201d and abruptly disappears. A year later, Mike and Kristen have been torn apart by the\r\ndisappearance of their son, and start to have supernatural visions, including\r\nhearing a child screaming and seeing Charlie on a bus. Is Charlie trying to\r\ncommunicate to them from the other side? With a laughably small amount of\r\nresearch, Mike notices that while children who go missing are often found,\r\nthose who disappear on All Hallow\u2019s Eve rarely come home again. Someone, or\r\nsomething, is abducting kids on October 31st, and many of the\r\nguardians of the abductees tell the same story of the titular phrase being said\r\njust before they disappeared. Who is the ghost that must be paid? What must he\r\nor she be paid with? Does this have something to do with Cage\u2019s notorious IRS\r\nproblems? It\u2019s amazing how long \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d drags itself through a feature-length running time with almost nothing to speak of in terms of plot.\r\nCharlie disappears, and dad looks for him. The set-up is a slog, as we know\r\nthere\u2019s no movie without dad making contact with his son again, and there\u2019s\r\nabsolutely no style or character to get us over the lack of narrative suspense.\r\nCage doesn\u2019t even give it his wide-eyed all; he\u2019s more fun in \u201cLeft Behind.\u201d\r\nPerhaps presuming that director Uli Edel would actually dramatically ground \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d\r\nin something relatable, Cage actually plays it straight, which eliminates any\r\nB-movie fun that could even be had with this misstep. If you\u2019re going to do a\r\nlackluster horror movie just for the money, at least try and have some fun with\r\nit. Advertisement Instead, \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d does nothing that we haven\u2019t seen\r\ndone more entertainingly and incisively in other films.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Windfall", "Review": "A documentary named \"Windfall\" has taken the wind out of my sails. Assuming it can be trusted (and many of its claims seem self-evident), wind turbines are a blight upon the land and yet another device by which energy corporations and Wall Street, led by the always reliable Goldman Sachs, are picking the pockets of those who can least afford it. There is even some question whether wind energy uses more power than it generates. Director Laura Israel's film is set almost entirely in Meredith, N.Y., a farming area of some 2,000 people in a beautiful Catskills landscape. A few dairy and beef farms still survive, but many of the residents are now retired people who have come here with their dreams. Most of them were once \"of course\" in favor of wind power, which offered the hope of clean, cheap energy. When an Irish corporation named Airtricity came around offering land owners $5,000, neighbors $500 apiece and the town a 2 percent cut of the revenue, that was a win-win, right? Advertisement So it appeared. But some residents, including a former editor for an encyclopedia and the final photo editor of Life magazine, began doing some research. The town board set up an energy advisory panel, and after a year of study, it recommended the town refuse the Airtricity offer. The town board rejected the panel's finding. One of them recused himself because of his personal holdings in energy. The others saw no conflict. This generated a furor in Meredith, and we meet people who were best friends for years and now were no longer on speaking terms. We watch board meetings and meet lots of locals; the film bypasses the usual expert talking heads and relies on the personal experiences of these individuals. I learned that wind turbines are unimaginably larger than I thought. It's not a matter of having a cute little windmill in your backyard. A turbine is 400 feet tall, weighs 600,000 pounds, and is rooted in tons and tons of poured concrete. If one is nearby (and given the necessary density, one is always nearby), it generates a relentless low-frequency thrum-thrum-thrum that seems to emanate from the very walls of your home. The dark revolving shadows of its blades are cast for miles, and cause a rhythmic light-and-shade pulsing inside and outside your house. Living in an area with all that going, many people have developed headaches, nausea, depression and hypertension.  The effect on property values is devastating. The owner of a lovely restored 19th century farmhouse asks \u2014 who will buy it now? People don't come to the Catskills to undergo nonstop mental torture. Nor do other living things like wind turbines. Their blades, revolving at 150 miles an hour, slice birds into pieces and create low-pressure areas that cause the lungs of bats to explode. For the loss of its peace of mind, a community's cut of the profits may be enough to pay for a pickup truck. Tax revenue drops because many of those (who can afford to) flee. Turbines sometimes topple over or catch fire (all firemen can do is stand and watch). And of course the local taxing agencies have been required to take advantage of sweetheart state and federal tax cuts, promoted by the industry's lobbyists. \"Windfall\" left me disheartened. I thought wind energy was something I could believe in. This film suggests it's just another corporate flim-flam game. Of course, the documentary could be mistaken, and there are no doubt platoons of lawyers, lobbyists and publicists to say so. How many of them live on wind farms? Advertisement"}

Romero is our leading researcher in this area, having reinvented zombies for modern times with \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d (1967), and returned to them from time to time, most successfully in the excellent \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d (1979). Advertisement Zombies, as I have noted before (and before, and before) make excellent movie creatures because they are smart enough to be dangerous, slow enough to kill and dead enough that we need not feel grief. Romero has not even begun to run out of ways to kill them. My favorite shot in this film shows a zombie having its head blown apart, with the skullcap bouncing into the air and falling down to fit neatly over the neck. If that doesn't appeal to you, nothing will. I've seen a whole lot of zombies killed. I've been cordial over the years with Romero, who in addition to reinventing zombies, demonstrated how horror movies were a low-cost point of entry for independent filmmakers. To him we possibly owe such directors as David Cronenberg and John Carpenter. \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d was a biting indictment of the culture of the shopping mall, with most of its action in a landscape of modern retailing and merchandising. It was also funny. All true. But after you've seen, oh, I dunno, 20 or 30 zombie movies, you sort of stop caring very much, unless something new is going on, as in \u201cZombieland.\u201d At this point, I find myself watching primarily to spot and appreciate entertaining new ways to slaughter zombies. That's why the skullcap moment appealed to me. It was new.\rNot much else is new in \u201cSurvival of the Dead.\u201d After a vaguely explained plague of zombies has broken out, America has descended into post-apocalyptic warfare. The zombie disease is spreading. If one bites you, you become a zombie. That ability to infect others was once the special gift of vampires, and I suspect it has now been bestowed on zombies by gene-splicing at the generic level. All zombies share one characteristic: They take a lickin' and keep on tickin'. On the island off Delaware, we meet the O'Flynns and Muldoons, who are in the dependable tradition of the Hatfields and McCoys. The O'Flynns believe zombies exist to be destroyed. The Muldoons, more humane, want to chain them up and keep them around until a cure is discovered. How do you vote? How would you feel if the Muldoon scheme worked, and you were a cured zombie? Would your flesh still look a little decomposed? Would you mention it in your entry on Match.com? The leader of the O'Flynns is exiled to the mainland via rowboat, and in Philadelphia, we encounter paramilitaries who are fighting off zombies and considering going to\u2026the island off the Delaware. I was unable to stir up the slightest interest in the O'Flynns and Muldoons, the military types reminded me of the better \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d and finally all that kept my attention were the ingenious ways Romero killed the zombies. The man is a fount of imagination. Scarcely a zombie dies in a boring way. So there's that. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Hitman", "Review": "This may only be my quirky way of thinking, but if you wanted to move through the world as an invisible hit man responsible for more than 100 killings on six continents, would you shave your head to reveal the bar code tattooed on the back of your skull? Yeah, not me, either. But Agent 47 has great success with this disguise in \"Hitman,\" which is a better movie than I thought it might be. Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) has no name because he was raised as an orphan from birth by a shadowy organization named the Agency, which is \"known to all governments\" and performs assassinations for hire. He has been trained in all the killing skills and none of the human ones, which is why the young woman Nika (Olga Kurylenko) is such a challenge for him. A prostitute held in slavery by the drug-dealing brother of the Russian president, she follows him, obeys him, offers herself to him and, although he remains distant, 47 cannot remain indifferent. Advertisement Agent 47 is in Russia on a job: Assassinate Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), the president. This he thinks he does. Yet Belicoff appears in public almost immediately after the hit, alive and speaking. How did this happen? An Interpol agent named Mike (Dougray Scott) is just as puzzled: \"My man doesn't miss.\" How it happens is not my business to tell you, but I will say that Agent 47 is betrayed by the Agency and finds himself being pursued by both Interpol and the Russian secret police. As he and Nika move from St. Petersburg to Moscow, there is one shoot-out after another, close escapes, daring leaps into the void, high-tech booby traps, and so on. The movie, directed by Xavier Gens, was inspired by a best-selling video game and serves as an excellent illustration of my conviction that video games will never become an art form -- never, at least, until they morph into something else or more. What I found intriguing about the movie was the lonely self-sufficiency of Agent 47, his life without a boyhood, his lack of a proper name, his single-purpose training. When Nika comes into his life, he is trained to guard against her, but he cannot, because she is helpless, needy, depends on him and is a victim like himself. So he takes her along (which only increases her danger) while not making love. You know what? I think he may be a virgin trained to make war, not love. To the degree the movie explores their relationship, it is absorbing. There is also intrigue at the highest levels of Russian politics, as the moderate Belikoff is apparently targeted for death. All of that is well done. Other scenes, which involve Agent 47 striding down corridors, an automatic weapon in each hand, shooting down opponents who come dressed as Jedi troopers in black. These scenes are no doubt from the video game. The troopers spring into sight, pop up and start shooting, and he has target practice. He also jumps out of windows without knowing where he's going to land, and that feels like he's cashing in a chip he won earlier in the game. If you want to see what Agent 47 might have seemed like without the obligatory video game requirements, I urge you to rent Jean-Pierre Melville's \"Le Samourai\" (1967), which is about a lone-wolf assassin in Paris (Alain Delon). He too works alone, is a professional, cuts off his emotions, seems lonely and cold. But the movie is about him, not his killing score. Advertisement The key producer on \"Hitman\" was Adrian Askarieh, who told Variety he doesn't consult or collaborate with the makers of a video game he has purchased for filming, but focuses on the characters and situation. Wise. To the degree he doesn't try to reproduce the aim-and-shoot material, he has a movie here. To the degree Olyphant and Kurylenko can flesh out their characters, they do. The movie is rated R, despite reports that the studio demanded edits to trim down the violence. It has a high body count but very little blood and gore. I wish it had less. It's the people we care about in movies, not how many dead bodies they can stack up. \"Hitman\" stands right on the threshold between video games and art. On the wrong side of the threshold, but still, give it credit. Meville's \"Le Samourai\" is reviewed in the Great Movies section at rogerebert.com."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "My Piece of the Pie", "Review": "Writer-director Cedric Klapisch supplies a little of all five in \"My Piece of Pie,\" a film about the everyday ways in which the markets deal in abstract numbers without the slightest interest in the lives that might be affected. In the French city of Dunkirk, a factory closes suddenly, families are uprooted, people lose their incomes and suddenly find themselves poor. In the most interesting element of the film, we see how a man seated before six computer screens in his Paris luxury apartment taps a key here and a key there and behaves as what Tom Wolfe immortalized as a Master of the Universe. Advertisement This man is Steve Delarue (Gilles Lellouche): 35, rich, single and a right proper bastard. There's a sequence here in which he boldly picks up a model named Tessa (Marine Vacth), flies her in his private plane to Venice and is shocked that she won't have sex with him because she'd sort of prefer to, you know, like him first. WTF? Now he's heard everything. The detailed savagery of his behavior indicates a man with no heart, no conscience and not even much common sense; Tessa tells him he will never be happy because he will never be able to love anyone but himself. Into his wretched life comes a pretty 40-ish woman named France (Karin Viard), a single mom who lost her job when he manipulated her factory out of existence. In Paris looking for work, she gets a job as Steve's house cleaner, a task that expands to include managing his clueless life. She doesn't know or care who he is. But she is practical and copes, for example when Steve's ex-wife, Melody (Raphaele Godin), dumps off their son, Alban (Lunis Sakji), without warning and announces she'll be in Thailand for a month. Steve needs a nanny. He doesn't like children, doesn't understand them, hardly knows his 3\u00bd-year-old son. France takes over, bedding down on a futon next to the boy in Steve's gym (formerly \u201cAlban's room\u201d), and they form a virtual family; she also doubles as his date at two social occasions, at which her brassy confidence stands out.  The movie is best when showing us the lives of France and the odious Steve. It loses its way with France's decision to pack up Alban and take him home with her to Dunkirk. She has well-meaning reasons for this trip, but to the world, it looks like a kidnapping, and there's nothing in her character, up until that point, that suggests she's remotely capable of such lunacy. The third act turns into an unlikely and contrived confrontation between Steve and unemployed workers.  Movies make unwritten contracts with us. While it's permitted for characters to reveal enormous surprises about themselves, I believe that by the last act, they should act more or less consistently in terms of the intelligence and judgment we've been led to expect of them. France unfortunately behaves entirely at the convenience of an unlikely plot turn. True, the movie sidesteps a couple of cliches it seems headed directly toward, but I might have preferred them to the preposterous melodrama it substitutes. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Horse Boy", "Review": "A documentary with Rupert Isaacson, Kristin Neff, Rowan Isaacson, Simon Baron-Cohen, Temple Grandin, Roy Richard Grinker, Tulga, Ghoste. \"The Horse Boy\" tells a remarkable story. A 4-year-old Texas boy with autism has angry seizures, isn't toilet-trained, is often distant and hostile. His parents fly with him to Mongolia, drive nine hours into the steppes and then journey by horseback, with the boy sharing their saddles, to a sacred mountain in reindeer country. There he undergoes a miraculous cure at the hands of shamans. Advertisement I have many inclinations, but no reason, to doubt this. At the end of the treatment, the shamans tell the parents that on the next day their boy will stop soiling his pants and throwing tantrums. This happens. Today, back home, little Rowan is now 6 and for the first time, plays with friends his own age. \"Is he cured? No,\" says Rupert Isaacson, his father. \"Is he still autistic? Yes.\" What happened \"seems miraculous,\" but he is skeptical enough to wonder if the trip itself was part of the cure. Rowan has a strong empathy with animals, especially with horses but also, we see, with goats -- who are docile and affectionate with him. Perhaps the enormity of a long horseback journey with his parents in clearly daunting conditions overwhelmed his defenses and calmed him. There seems no reason to question that he has improved. In the footage taken after the healing, we never see Rowan, except when he is happily playing with his new friends or smiling with his parents. Is that the whole story? You decide. To their credit, Isaacson and his wife, Kristin Neff, a University of Texas psychology professor, do not recommend that parents of other autistic children take them to the wilds of Siberia. All they know is what happened to Rowan. With any documentary, there is another story that goes unreported: the story of the making of the film. \"The Horse Boy\" didn't make itself. The parents and their son were accompanied to Siberia by the director-cinematographer Michel Orion Scott, apparently a second cameraman, sound technicians and a support staff. This cost money, upfront on the bottom line. Air fares, food, lodging, not least insurance for everyone and a completion bond for the film itself. You may know that the book of the experience, The Horse Boy, became a best-seller. The trip and the film were financed by a $1 million advance on the book that Isaacson proposed to write about this experience. He's the author of a successful previous book, The Healing Land: The Bushmen and the Kalahari Desert, which includes shamans on another continent. He had heard that the shamans of Mongolia, especially one legendary shaman, had unusual powers. The stakes are high in such a venture. What if the trip turns into a fool's errand? What if Rowan becomes worse, not better? It was obviously crucial that Rowan undergo some kind of dramatic improvement or there would be no film. It's well to keep that in mind. Advertisement The whole enterprise seems to be Isaacson's project. He narrates the film. Kristin, his wife, seems fully in accord with him, and they're both courageous, but I would have liked more insights from the side of her that teaches psychology. I imagine many parents of autistic children, while identifying with the strains autism places upon their marriage, would appreciate more information about Rowan's exact state at present. The film includes expert testimony from autism experts, including the famous Temple Grandin, an autistic professor at Colorado State, who has designed most of the environments used to handle cattle in the worldwide meatpacking industry. Her genius was to be able to identify with the point of view of the cattle. I've met her. A remarkable woman. She talks in the film about autism in general. The newspaperman in me would have asked her, \"Do you feel autistics feel a special empathy and calm with animals? Could the horseback journey itself have brought about some of the improvement?\""}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang", "Review": "There is an irresistible, Herzogian flavor to Kevin Macdonald\u2019s new documentary, \u201cSky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang.\u201d It celebrates the art and ambition of a Guo-Qiang, who paints images in the sky using colorful fireworks. Along with telling his story of artistic success, Macdonald\u2019s film specifically documents Guo-Qiang as he tries to create his most demanding project yet, the sky ladder\u2014a firework display that would ascend 1,650 feet into the air. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be Picasso?\u201d he asks, matter-of-factly. Advertisement   In \u201cSky Ladder,\u201d the firework proves a fascinating instrument to achieve such heights of genius\u2014one used to create a moment, painting the sky with calculated explosions and bright colors, creating clouds of distinct beauty. In various displays and montages, it feels like Macdonald is able to capture the in-person experience of Guo-Qiang\u2019s art. Using a great amount of footage from his displays and sequences captured in part by legendary cinematographer Robert Yeoman (a frequent collaborator with Wes Anderson), Macdonald utilizes wide shots and select close-ups to provide great detail, giving us a special look that instantly make this Netflix title worth watching on the best screen possible. The sound design of pops and sparks further illiustrates how an array of explosions can lead to something beyond words.\u00a0   A portrait of a fascinating artist and his unique art, Guo-Qiang proves to be a potent subject himself, his life narrative an interesting reflection of what creates an artist. With select footage of talking head interviews with his family and those who work for him, Macdonald shows how where we come from is incredibly influential on our expressiveness, especially regarding what and how we want to say something. Guo-Qiang was raised in Zhangou, an originating Chinese town of fireworks, where he honed his voice for art and expressive explosions. His father was an artistic calligrapher, who created and images in single instructive strokes, a type of formalism that was antagonized by China\u2019s cultural revolution, but continued by his son decades later in city harbors with calculated clouds of smoke.   As \u201cSky Ladder\u201d chronicles the international success of Guo-Qiang, how he went from controlled explosions on canvasses (using smoke as the paint) to becoming an international, Damien Hirst-like brand, the film parallels with the question of art\u2019s commodification and the limits of integrity. Guo-Qiang\u2019s motivation to reinvent the possibility of the firework is challenged by those with smaller imaginations\u2014those who want to use his bright, intricate images for mere entertainment, or censor it, like when he\u2019s commissioned to do a display for China\u2019s APEC economic leaders conference in 2014. A central moment with him \u201ccollaborating\u201d with government officials is painful. In a rare instance where Macdonald takes a more critical stance to a subject he is clearly a huge fan of, Guo-Qiang lists other artists who do similar gigs, and claims there is a bias against him because it\u2019s China. The sequence is an emotional roller coaster, and with the deep understanding Macdonald\u2019s film provides us of Guo-Qiang\u2019s unique art, the resulting fireworks display, lacking color or heart, is understood to be a tragedy. Advertisement   This chapter is one of many interesting ideas that collectively make \u201cSky Ladder\u201d an often fascinating documentary, even if its focus doesn\u2019t successfully combine biographical details with the title piece pursuit (the film can seem unfocused when it\u2019s more likely poorly self-advertised). In the end, it is Macdonald\u2019s artistry that matters most: He has not made a tribute but an extension of Guo-Qiang\u2019s art, while utilizing the power of the documentary. In 80 minutes, \u201cSky Ladder\u201d teaches you through sight, sound and dialogue about a new artistic language, while making you an expert on one of its masters. For all of the film's ideas of art and entertainment, it might just forever change your preconceptions of the firework."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Life of a King", "Review": "For a movie about chess\u2014a game in which strategy, smarts and staying a step ahead of your opponent are crucial\u2014\"Life of a King\" is awfully formulaic and predictable.\u00a0Based on the true story of ex-con-turned-youth-mentor Eugene Brown, director and co-writer Jake Goldberger's drama is earnest to a fault and hits all the inspiring notes you'd expect. Brown's story is a good one, though, and solid performances\u2014especially from star Cuba Gooding Jr.\u2014elevate the film slightly above the familiar trappings of its genre. Advertisement Actually, \"Life of a King\" is more of a mixture of two genres: It has the uplift of a \"Stand and Deliver\" or a \"Dangerous Minds,\" in which tough kids meet even tougher teachers, combined with every underdog sports film you've ever seen, particularly \"The Karate Kid.\" You know exactly what you're getting with either of these experiences, so what matters is innovation in terms of aesthetics or structure or dialogue. Goldberg's film, however, is rather straightforward and unremarkable on all these fronts.   But Gooding has tamped down his signature swagger\u2014the boisterous energy that's been a part of his persona since his Oscar-winning \"Jerry Maguire\" performance\u2014to play Brown, who spent 18 years in prison for bank robbery. When we first see him, he's playing chess through the bars of his cell with the lifer next door (a sadly underused Dennis Haysbert). A lifetime of mistakes has beaten Brown down, and there's a sadness in his eyes, an apprehension to his demeanor.  Once he's released, Brown returns to his Washington D.C. neighborhood, where the former criminal now finds it hard to earn an honest living. His old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Perry (Richard T. Jones), who now runs the streets himself, offers Brown the chance to start making quick money again. Instead, Brown lies on his resume about being a convicted felon and lands a job as a janitor at the local high school. (LisaGay Hamilton has a no-nonsense dignity as the principal who hires him.)  Soon he is minding detention, where he's the rare adult who can relate to the rebellious, self-destructive streak that runs through the young thugs who dwell there. Chief among them are Clifton (Carlton Byrd), a big kid who works for Perry selling weed to his classmates; troubled Tahime (Malcolm M. Mays), whose single mom (Paula Jai Parker) is a drug addict; and the sweet, scrawny Peanut (Kevin Hendricks), who's just along for the ride.   Brown first earns the unruly students' attention when he proves they can't intimidate him\u2014after all, he was them once. But then he earns their respect when he hustles Peanut in cards. As he finds his footing, he strengthens his voice, and soon introduces the students to his true love: chess. While teaching them the game forces them to settle down, focus and use their brains (which is a good thing), it also inspires Brown, and the film, to hammer us over the head with the notion that chess is a metaphor for life (which is a bad thing). Think before you move! Protect your king! At the device's most obvious, Brown waxes poetic about the importance of the king just as one of his students is being shot to death in an alley.   Advertisement Nevertheless, Brown is undaunted, and forges on with his instruction\u2014which has now developed into a full-blown chess club in a run-down house he's rented and renovated. (All that sweeping, cleaning and painting with the kids' help provides fodder for one of the films' three, count 'em, three montages.) And Tahime has become his star pupil, with an untapped intellect and natural gift for the game.   Will Tahime overcome enormous odds and make something of his life? Will Brown's own children\u2014pre-law student Katrina (Rachae Thomas) and juvenile delinquent Marcus (Jordan Calloway)\u2014ever cast aside their bitterness and learn to embrace this changed man? If you've ever seen a movie before, the answer to these questions is never really in doubt. The actors bring heart to their performances, if not the element of surprise."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Horse Money", "Review": "Pedro Costa's first narrative film in nine years, \"Horse Money,\" is as gorgeous and impenetrable as a dream. It might be set in an afterlife where souls contemplate their lives (and their mistakes, and their misfortunes), or there might be something else to it; like many of the Portuguese filmmaker's works, this one teases and baffles but refuses to explain itself. It makes a quartet of what was once called the\u00a0Fontainhas Trilogy. It is named after the poor neighborhood in Lisbon where Costa originally went with 35mm film equipment to make a lush dramatic feature in the 1990s, only to abandon it and shoot the film with a small video camera\u2014a decision that led Costa down the path that eventually developed his unique aesthetic, which is simultaneously gritty and glossy, a look that delves into the emotional essence of experience by bypassing the signifiers of \"realism\" entirely. Advertisement The film's main character is the 60-year old\u00a0Ventura, a working class Cape Verdean immigrant. He's playing a highly stylized version of himself in situations drawn from his own life, developed in conversations with his friend Costa. Ventura was the star of Costa's last film, \"Colossal Youth,\" and although Costa has suggested that Ventura, never a professional actor anyway, probably doesn't have any more movies left in him, one hopes that they will continue to work together, because theirs is one of the great actor-director collaborations in recent cinema.\u00a0 The intervening years since their last film together have not been kind to Ventura. He (or the character? is there a difference?) has a nerve disease that makes his hands shake. Where he seemed mysterious and implacable, rock-like at times, in much of \"Colossal Youth,\" here he seems mostly regretful and anxious and often terrified. His lack of vanity as he confronts his own physical decline verges on heroic. There is no vanity in this performance.\u00a0 Even if there were, though, Costa's filmmaking would've undercut it. He shoots Ventura's face, and the faces of all the other actors, in tight closeups and in harshly lit long shots that emphasize the shapes of their bodies and the creases in their faces. Tears well up in Ventura's eyes as he lingers in the pitch-black halls and rooms of an unnamed mental hospital, occasionally leaving and being brought back by authorities. There are other inmates in there with him. A\u00a0group\u00a0of inmates appears, materializes almost, by his bedside early on. They share their own life stories. They are laborers, criminals. They are the\u00a0dispossessed, the oppressed.\u00a0 Ventura is tripping down memory lane to such a degree that he seems to be suffering from dementia, but it might just be a Willy Loman or \"The Singing Detective\" type of situation\u2014heavy on metaphorically ripe scenarios, but less affected than a stage play or time-jumping film might be, because the past is described verbally but not envisioned in flashback. In one scene, Ventura tells a doctor that he is a teenager and has been taken to the hospital by the\u00a0the MFA, the Portuguese revolutionary army ended the African colonial war and won independence for Cape Verde. In a lot of Ventura's monologues, he thinks he is 19, or that it's 1975.\u00a0 Advertisement Costa's compositions enfold him in the gloom of regretful memory as he speaks. He is visited by figures from his past, including\u00a0\u00a0Vitalina (Vitalina Varela), a woman who has returned to Lisbon from Cape Verde to bury her husband, who died three days earlier. Ventura assures her that her husband is \"here with me,\" but we aren't sure how to take that. Here in the hospital? Here in Ventura's heart? The movie is content with not knowing, even though the not-knowing may confuse or even infuriate the viewer. The film's final stretch is dominated by Ventura's ride in an elevator with a gun-toting soldier who never speaks. He just stands there like a statue. At times you aren't sure if he's alive. Are any of the characters alive?\u00a0 You'll see the word \"dream\" used a lot in descriptions of the movie. The stark, high-contrast cinematography aims for the sort of effect rarely conjured outside of a German Expressionist movie from the 1920s, or the noir-est of film noir, two modes that often posed their stories in someplace other than recognizable reality\u2014a psychological space where feelings dictate the shape and texture of the frame and the way the characters behave within it. The title refers to a horse that was torn apart by vultures.\u00a0 At points I was reminded of some of the most photographically stylized narrative features produced during Hollywood's postwar era, including \"My Darling Clementine\" and \"Moontide,\" which have much more in the way of a traditional \"story\" than this but seem similarly inclined to let things unfold in a figurative space, one that is seemingly disconnected from any timeline or map even though the characters mention actual places and actual dates as they speak. \u00a0 The rating at the top of this page is for originality and conviction, not for entertainment value, as if that phrase could mean anything when applied to such a gravely serious and mysterious movie. This is not a movie that comes to you. You have to go to it. There are long stretches of \"Horse Money\" in which you will have no idea what's going on or how the movie wants you to take it, if indeed it wants you take it in any particular way, and on the basis of Costa's past work, that seems unlikely. The best approach is to surrender to it as you might a dream and let the images overwhelm you. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Spy", "Review": "As a distaff version of James Bond in \u201cSpy,\u201d Hollywood\u2019s reigning empress of ha-ha Melissa McCarthy has a license not just to kill the audience with laughter but also to slay us with her acting skills. And it\u2019s a bust-a-gut thing of beauty to watch her give a wholly satisfying lead performance with a complete dramatic arc. Just observe how her eyes dramatically moisten in reaction to her top-notch co-stars in ways that would make Bette Davis proud. That\u2019s even if her lips are spewing a scathing string of inappropriate R-rated putdowns.\u00a0 Advertisement After her misbegotten turn last summer as a down-on-her-luck sadsack in \u201cTammy\u201d left even the most fervent \u201cMike & Molly\u201d fans worried that the actress had lost her mouthy mojo (although her supporting part in \u201cSt. Vincent\u201d provided some solace), it is gratifying to see her back in the arms of her best collaborator\u2014director Paul Feig. The man behind her breakout in \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and her blockbuster pairing with Sandra Bullock in \u201cThe Heat\u201d also steps up his game. He doesn\u2019t just shoot off a random round of in-jokes and sight gags \u201cAustin Powers\u201d-style. Feig also provides a decent if convoluted espionage plot\u2014complete with tense action sequences, a surprising twist and 007-inspired opening credits\u2014while spiked with a high percentage of gags that actually succeed. Most of the pleasure is derived from observing McCarthy\u2019s sweet if insecure Susan Cooper grow from CIA analyst stuck working in a dank vermin-infested bunker to a highly skilled undercover sleuth seeking the whereabouts of a stolen nuke. She is equally at ease with posing as a Midwest cat lady or engaging in hand-to-hand battle a la Jackie Chan against a female assailant in a confined kitchen space by employing baguettes, frying pans and lettuce as lethal weaponry. But when we first meet Cooper, she is performing her duties as a field agent\u2019s \u201cearpiece\u201d while live-monitoring his whereabouts via satellite images and a body cam. She\u2019s basically a human GPS who warns of impending threats and wrong turns into danger. She yearns to go after the bad guys herself, but for now she is satisfied with assisting smug undercover dandy Bradley Fine (a very-fine-indeed Jude Law, clearly enjoying a contact high from being in such a free-wheeling ensemble romp), especially since she harbors a not-so-secret crush for him. But when it appears he has died on the job, Cooper\u2019s exasperated boss Allison Janney (somewhat channeling her \u201cJuno\u201d hubby J.K. Simmons) decides to take a chance on sending her to Europe to hunt down the bad guys. As seen in previous films, McCarthy works best with others and Feig here provides a fine array of foils. British funny lady Miranda Hart is a true find for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen \u201cCall the Midwife\u201d on PBS as Cooper\u2019s well-meaning if clumsy sidekick Nancy who fills in as her earpiece. At 6-foot-1, Hart looms over McCarthy and everyone else, and the two fit nicely into the mismatched tradition of Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy. Someone, of course, has to be the cold-hearted villain and that would be \u201cBridesmaids\u201d alum Rose Byrne. With an elaborate hairdo that could double as a Byzantine sculpture and a constant look of disdain, Byrne crosses paths with Cooper when the agent poses as her bodyguard and the two take an instant dislike to each other. While McCarthy is no slouch in the insult department, Byrne\u2019s posh demeanor allows her to get away with some rather vile verbal slaps that would otherwise leave viewers groaning. Advertisement But McCarthy truly meets her match in the form of British action star Jason Statham, who goes wonderfully bonkers as a bratty rogue agent named Ford who is incensed that a newbie like Cooper is on the case and shows his disgruntlement by constantly bragging about his manly feats of yore like a Cockney Paul Bunyan (\u201cI\u2019ve swirled enough microchips to shit a f\u2014kin\u2019 computer\u201d).\u00a0 But what I found myself most appreciating about \u201cSpy\u201d went beyond the bouncy and brassy McCarthy\u2019s regular servings of tasty bits of business\u2014dubbing her fists Cagney and Lacy, telling a stunned Swedish henchman to cut off his own manhood and stick it on his forehead like a unicorn\u2019s horn, or accidentally mistaking a mushroom-like hot towelette for an appetizer. Instead, it was how Feig and company take the piss out of all the macho grandstanding and chauvinistic attitudes ingrained in the spy genre. That would include Nancy\u2019s observation that Ford\u2019s tweed cap makes him look as if he is from the cast of \u201cNewsies.\u201d But, mostly, McCarthy and her femme cohorts are too busy doing their jobs to be bothered with the sexist come-ons by the likes of Aldo, a harassing lug of a guardian who mostly wants to protect Cooper\u2019s breasts. Although Hart\u2019s Nancy does take a detour to get to hang with rapper 50 Cent (a cameo that pays off better than one would think).\u00a0 All is not perfect, however. Having a male land atop a woman in an awkward position is sort of amusing once but not twice. And, as was the case with the crime caper \u201cThe Heat,\u201d an excess of violence does get the point across that dames are as tough if not tougher than the dudes. But when thugs begin to pile up with reckless abandon and McCarthy\u2019s Cooper barely flinches as she shoots her foes dead, it distracts from rather than enhances the humor at hand.\u00a0But the true measure of a comedy is always how much you actually laugh. As long as the chuckles exceed the body count, all is good."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Race", "Review": "\u201cRace\u201d takes a complicated, messy story and shapes it with the bland cookie-cutter mold too often seen in the biopic genre. The predictability of its storytelling beats isn\u2019t really the problem, for there is comfort to be found in the dance of the familiar. The issue here is the tone of the material. Writers Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse coddle the viewer, never once hitting us with the full brunt of the current and future horrors experienced by Blacks in America and the Jews in Germany during this period. It\u2019s as if an undiluted moment of true discomfort or complexity would destroy rather than amplify the uplifting moments. Additionally, the film\u2019s subject, Jesse Owens, has to share his tale with someone who deserves to be the subject of her own movie. While the ads hype Owens\u2019 heroism, they don\u2019t tell you that \u201cRace\u201d sees propaganda filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl as an equally big hero.\u00a0This may work for cinephiles, but it left a sour aftertaste for me. Advertisement Owens\u2019 story is a fascinating tale of record-breaking athleticism enacted in a time of racism and anti-Semitism. Shady, controversial dealings stopped an Olympic boycott and enabled the United States to compete in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The games were presented by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels as proof of Aryan superiority, yet their athletic German engineering was no match for a man deemed inferior to Whites by the United States and Nazi Germany. Owens (a fine Stephan James from \u201cSelma\u201d) chose to defy a boycott-favoring consensus that included the NAACP in order to live his dream of Olympic glory, yet when he returned with four gold medals, his heroics were no match for the racist status quo. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wouldn\u2019t congratulate nor meet with him, and Owens couldn\u2019t use the front door of the Waldorf-Astoria to attend a dinner held in his honor. To its credit, \u201cRace\u201d ably covers all this material. But this is an easily distracted movie. For example, there\u2019s an interminable subplot involving Owens\u2019 dalliance with a woman who was not his high school sweetheart/eventual wife Ruth (Shanice Banton). It goes nowhere except to the land of clich\u00e9, serving as a means to inject conflict into the Owens\u2019 relationship. More time is spent on Riefenstahl interacting with people than Owens bonding with his teammates or training. Despite an admirable attempt by Banton and James to bring a sense of romance to their underwritten scenes, and James\u2019 enjoyable interactions with a surprisingly good Jason Sudekis as Coach Larry Snyder, it often feels as if Jesse Owens is trotted out simply to win the\u00a0races\u00a0that made him famous. The solid cast is rounded out with veteran actors including Jeremy Irons and William Hurt, both of whom elevate the material. Irons, as Avery Brundage, is especially good here; he brings a Trump-like essence to\u00a0all the showy, non-athletic scenes. Whether he\u2019s arguing with Hurt\u2019s Jeremiah Mahoney or negotiating with Barnaby Metschurat\u2019s Goebbels for an appearances-sake only moratorium on the harsh treatment of Jewish people, Irons is a commanding presence even if you know the film is downplaying some of the more sinister aspects of his storyline. Advertisement Director Stephen Hopkins shoots the film, and the big\u00a0races, with minimal fuss or theatrics, but he does have one superbly showy moment when Owens first enters the Olympics stadium. The tricky camerawork, the CGI crowd and James\u2019 awed reaction work together to present a \u201cyou are there\u201d moment that\u2019s truly captivating. James is also quite convincing in Owens\u2019 heats, running in the same manner Owens would have back in 1936.\u00a0The best scenes in the film occur in this section, when Owens meets Carl \u201cLuz\u201d Long (David Kross), a German rival who later becomes a very good friend. Long\u2019s admiration for the man he hoped to beat led him to violate several unspoken rules of the games, including celebrating with Owens after he breaks the long jump record.\u00a0These scenes highlight what \u201cRace\u201d could have been had it focused more on Owens\u2019 personal relationships. Since there has only been one other telling of Owens\u2019 story (the 1984 TV movie starring Dorian Harewood and Debbi Morgan) \u201cRace\u201d is to be commended for bringing a new generation to this American hero. I can see it being shown in high schools as a teaching tool and to track teams like the one I once ran on in my youth. But I\u2019m giving the film a marginally negative grade for three reasons, none of which should prohibit you from seeing \u201cRace\u201d if you so desire. First, the Leni Riefenstahl scenes are completely out of place. It\u2019s not that she shouldn\u2019t have been in the movie\u2014after all, her \u201cOlympia\u201d (which I\u2019ve seen and is quite interesting) captured the footage of Owens to which we otherwise would never have borne witness\u2014nor is it because of Carice Van Houten\u2019s (\u201cBlack Book\u201d) performance (she\u2019s good). It\u2019s out of place because \u201cRace\u201d doesn\u2019t acknowledge why Riefenstahl was there in the first place: to document the supposed superiority of the White\u00a0race. She got lucky, from a filmmaking perspective, when Owens showed up to kick ass, but she had no idea he\u2019d cause that much of a stir. \u201cRace\u201d instead presents her as a Hitler-defying subversive, standing up to Goebbels in a scene I simply did not buy. Riefenstahl deserves her own movie, and should have been on the sidelines of this one. Second, this material needed a little more edge and darkness. Hopkins can\u2019t even let the powerful scene of the Owens\u2019 entering the side entrance of the Waldorf affect and leave us with sadness and anger. The film interrupts it with a staged moment of hope, as If to say \u201csee, it wasn\u2019t all that bad!\u201d It was that bad. Third, \u201cRace\u201d is very good at showing us what Jesse Owens did, but falters at showing us who Jesse Owens was. When the film is over, ask yourself if you thought he was completely fleshed out as a character. That may not bug you as much as it did me, so I won\u2019t begrudge you if \u201cRace\u201d makes you stand up and cheer with impunity. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Silence", "Review": "\"Silence\" is a monumental work, and a punishing one. It puts you through hell with no promise of enlightenment, only a set of questions and propositions, sensations and experiences. It is no surprise to learn that the film's director, Martin Scorsese, has been working on it for decades, since he first read the 1966\u00a0source novel\u00a0by Sh\u00fbsaku End\u00f4 about Jesuit priests suffering for their faith in 17th century Japan, where Christianity is outlawed. I can't think of another Scorsese film that's so intent on simply showing us things and letting us consider their meaning. There's a little bit of voiceover narration and a few shots that go inside characters' perceptions, but for the most part you're an observer, watching people from a purposeful distance. The film starts with a long moment of actual silence, and embraces silence throughout its running time, or something akin to silence. Wood burning, waves crashing, wind moving through grass: this is what you often hear in place of a musical score. When \"Silence\" is not quiet, you wish that it were, because the soundtrack is filled with moans of pain and screams of agony and the sounds of bones being broken and flame searing flesh. And, of course, during such moments you fear silence, too, because the grave is silent. Advertisement The story is simple: two priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) leave Portugal for Japan to find a third priest (Liam Neeson) who has gone missing while working as a missionary. The third priest is believed to have committed apostasy by stepping on an image of Jesus Christ after being tormented by the Japanese. Eventually, one of these wandering priests\u2014Garfield's character,\u00a0Father Sebasti\u00e3o Rodrigues\u2014gets captured and goes through a similar experience, surviving torture and witnessing the torture of others while pondering unanswerable questions: How much suffering can a man take before breaking and renouncing that which is most important to him? If he does break, does it mean he has failed God? Does God want him to resist blasphemy no matter what the cost? Or does he want the priest to give up and renounce his faith, secure in the knowledge that God's love is great enough to forgive him for not being able to endure unendurable pain? Is God indifferent to the suffering? Does He even notice it? The movie starts with the first priest,\u00a0Father Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Ferreira (Neeson), witnessing mass torture of Christians and being told that if he will only commit apostasy, the suffering will cease. The story then jumps forward many years to find Father Rodrigues and his partner,\u00a0Father Francisco Garrpe (Adam Driver), as they make their way to Japan by way of Macao (with help from a Japanese Christian whose own faith seems reawakened by serving as their guide). The first hour of the film is a somewhat picaresque narrative that slowly builds dread as the priests get closer to figuring out what happened their predecessor. The Japanese authorities don't take kindly to Europeans wandering around their island nation talking about the glories of Jesus. In fact, they see Christianity as a cancer to be cut from the body politic. In the film's second half, Father Rodrigues finds himself locked in a wooden cage and forced to watch and hear the torture of Japanese Christians\u2014some of whom followed and helped him. He is plagued by doubts, not just about the wisdom of coming to Japan or his capacity to survive this ordeal, but the wisdom of the missionary enterprise, which expects people to suffer and die on behalf of ideals. The priest even begins to wonder what God wants, what He's thinking, and whether He has a point-of-view on misery and pain. Advertisement What would Jesus do? A lot of people in Father Rodrigues' position would interpret that as a physical challenge:\u00a0if Christ withstood the agonies of the cross, I can get through this.\u00a0But Christ wasn't mortal, so it's an unfair test. But what if the unfairness of the test is the test? And what of the other prisoners in the facility with the priest? All it would take to end their suffering\u2014or so the priest is told\u2014is one footprint on the image of the savior. Is it moral to allow others to suffer when their suffering can be ended with a single symbolic gesture? Would God want that? Maybe the priest is destined to realize that it\u2019s all right to apostatize if it ends the pain of others.\u00a0 Scorsese and his co-screenwriter Jay Cocks\u2014the two did uncredited rewrites on \"The Last Temptation of Christ\"\u2014have been accused by some of my colleagues of glorifying the European missionaries, or at least not examining them in a critical enough way. I didn\u2019t get this out of \u201cSilence\u201d at all. In fact, one of the things that impressed me most about it was the care it devotes to understanding the position of the Japanese authorities. Without condoning their brutality, it lets a major character\u2014Inoue Masashige (Issei Ogata), one of the officials in charge of eradicating Christianity from Japan, and the supervisor of the hero\u2019s suffering\u2014explain the official point-of-view on Western religion. He doesn\u2019t just consider it a corrupting influence on Japanese culture, he doubts that Christianity can truly take root in the \u201cswamp\u201d (his word) of his home country. There are echoes here of another recurring Scorsese fascination, the self-preservation instinct of the tribe. The tribe may tolerate rebellion, heresy or external threats up to a point, but after that they crack down mercilessly.\u00a0 Scorsese's respectful distance makes the suffering more unbearable than it would be if he showed every atrocity in close-up. It's unsettling because it conflates the point-of-view of God and the point-of-view of the audience. You're paralyzed. You want to act, or you want the movie to act, to stop the suffering, but the suffering continues until finally it doesn't. We're watching men of God being tested. Try as they might, they cannot entirely wrap their minds around the purpose of the test, and when they do grapple with it, they worry that they've arrived at the wrong conclusion. They worry that they\u2019ve missed the point; that they're not faithful enough or smart enough to understand why this horror exists, or must exist.\u00a0I don\u2019t know what to think of the ending of the film, which I won\u2019t discuss here except to say that I\u2019ve changed my mind about it many times, and that it seems to be constructed to encourage viewers to come at it again from new angles rather than settling on a single conclusion.\u00a0This is not the sort of film you \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdon't like.\u201d It's a film that you experience and then live with.\u00a0 Advertisement Scorsese has been here before, in one sense or another\u2014not just in straightforwardly theological dramas such as \"Kundun\" and \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" but in his crime pictures and thrillers as well. The entire running time of \"Silence\" could be the self-flagellating fantasy of the young hoodlum hero of Scorsese's 1973 breakthrough \"Mean Streets\" as he holds his hand over a flame (the title character in \"Taxi Driver\" did the same thing), and the terrors visited upon the priests and their flock are sadistic enough to have come straight from the reptile brain of Max Cady in \"Cape Fear,\" a devil or demon figure who exists to punish people for the sins of weakness, hypocrisy and pride. But \"Silence\" foregrounds such things in the manner of a parable that is not intended to lead the listener to a single realization but to stimulate thought and emotion. This, too, is characteristic of Scorsese, who studied to be a priest but became a monk for cinema, and who nonchalantly describes himself as a \"lapsed Catholic\" yet has been preoccupied with sin and salvation for nearly 50 years and weaves Christian themes, imagery and situations throughout his work. You even find them in what might otherwise be straightforward commercial genre projects\u2014\"Cape Fear,\" \"The Departed\" and \"The Color of Money\" spring to mind\u2014in which Scorsese seems to be using theology to frame his story and characters in ways that he understands, maybe as a way of personalizing a story that's not all that personal otherwise. For a lapsed Catholic he sure does see the entire world in terms of imponderables and spiritual tests. Maybe there\u2019s an alternate reality in which Scorsese became a priest. I bet he was a good one."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Harmontown", "Review": "Dan Harmon, the creator of \u201cCommunity,\u201d star of the podcast \u201cHarmontown,\u201d\r\nand now subject of the film of the same name, is kind of an ass. He\u2019d admit\r\nit. \"Last Week\" host John Oliver, formerly a cast members of the cult NBC comedy, describes him as \u201cA human hand grenade who has a tendency to pull his own pin out.\u201d\r\nSarah Silverman goes into detail about how difficult he can be to work with, and\r\nhow that difficulty sabotaged their collaboration. And you should hear\r\nthe stories his girlfriend tells on the podcast. The best elements of the documentary \u201cHarmontown\u201d\r\ncapture the unique raw energy of Harmon. Most people in Hollywood are\r\noverly concerned about what you think of them. Harmon is the kind of guy who admonishes hecklers who scream out \u201cI love\r\nyou\u201d because he doesn\u2019t love himself. Advertisement After the third, low-rated season of \u201cCommunity,\u201d NBC made a\r\ntragically stupid decision and fired the creator and voice of the show. I\r\nrealized the error in that call at the time, especially after seeing how much\r\nthe show rebounded creatively when Harmon returned for the fifth season,\r\narguably the show\u2019s best. However, I mistakenly just thought that it was\r\nbecause Harmon was a good TV writer. That\u2019s not it. As is made clear by \u201cHarmontown,\u201d\r\nDan Harmon's very essence is reflected in \u201cCommunity.\u201d In the simplest of forms,\r\nHarmon is protagonist Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), the guy who can be a total\r\njerk sometimes but also embraces and protects those who are close to him.\u00a0 But the affinity between creator and series goes deeper than that. \u201cCommunity\u201d is about outcasts, and it is outcasts\r\nwho have been drawn to Harmon through his podcast and the tour he went on after\r\nNBC fired him. As is the case with Patton Oswalt and Kevin Smith, fans see something uniquely relatable in Harmon onstage. They may think, He looks like a friend of mine; he has my problems; if he can get up\r\nthere and talk about his life, mine might not be so bad. \u201cHarmontown\u201d has echoes of \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Can\u2019t\r\nStop\u201d and other documentaries about entertainers who are hard-working to the\r\npoint of self-destruction. The main difference is the sense of discovery on\r\ndisplay here. Harmon was kind of let loose after the \u201cCommunity\u201d debacle,\r\nalthough he was supposed to be working on pilot scripts for CBS and FOX, so he decided to see what his hit podcast would feel like on the road.\u00a0 The first few shows were not good. In fact, I would argue most of the shows aren\u2019t traditionally\r\n\u201cgood.\u201d What they are is raw. People play D&D on stage. Harmon drinks\r\nmoonshine. He crowd-surfs. He does as he feels in the moment. He is\r\njust trying to make contact with people, his fans. Seeing those fans lose their\r\nminds is fun. The look on the face of a young journalist after interviewing\r\nHarmon is priceless, like that of a kid meeting Mickey Mantle in his prime. It could not have been easy to make the self-described \u201cOprah of Ineffectual White People\u201d interesting for the length of a feature.\u00a0Harmon would admit he\u2019s not the best stand-up or on-stage performer. He's a writer trying something different. The result is more of an experiment than an accomplishment, which can be difficult to capture in a feature-length documentary.\u00a0The movie is primarily a piece of fan service aimed at those who love the podcast and \u201cCommunity.\u201d But even if you bear that in mind,\u00a0\"Harmontown\" can still feel as unfocused as one of Harmon\u2019s monologues. Just as the tour was more of an experiment than an accomplishment, so too is the documentary commemorating it.\u00a0I wish it were tighter, more like the brilliant sitcom that Harmon created and less like his podcast.\u00a0The final half\r\nhour gets a bit more \u201cwarts and all\u201d about Harmon's anger issues and is fascinating,\u00a0but it\r\ntakes too much D&D to get there. I suspect that a 20-minutes-shorter version of \u201cHarmontown\u201d would have been more entertaining and effective, but if a note like that came from a network suit, Harmon would probably ignore it.

Perhaps too interesting to be interviewed by someone else. In \"Nick Nolte: No Exit,\" he interviews himself. The way he does this does what it can to assist a fairly pointless documentary. Seated behind a silver laptop, well-groomed and wearing a big white Stetson, Nolte asked questions. Seated behind a black desktop computer and looking disheveled and squinty-eyed (well, all right, hung over), Nolte replies to them. It would be going too far to say he answers\" them. Advertisement On the wall behind him is the poster for Paul Schrader's \"Affliction\" (1997), the one he was nominated for and James Coburn won an Oscar for. \u00a0His credits include \"Hotel Rwanda,\" \"The Thin Red Line,\" \"Who'll Stop the Rain,\" \"North Dallas Forty,\" \"Lorenzo's Oil,\" \"Q & A\" and many others.

Yet despite everything the film has a certain fascination, because Nolte is such a charismatic enigma.

Can't say that he confided many secrets."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Pineapple Express", "Review": "David Gordon Green, that poet of the cinema, is the last person you'd expect to find directing a Judd Apatow male-buddy comedy about two potheads who start a drug war. But he does such a good job, there's a danger he'll become in demand by mainstream Hollywood and tempted away from the greatness he showed in \"George Washington\" and \"Undertow.\" (I can imagine his agent hiding this review from him.) \"Pineapple Express\" has all the elements you'd expect from the genre: male bonding, immature sexual desires, verbal scatology, formidable drug abuse, fight scenes, gunfire, explosions. Yawn? Not this time. It's a quality movie even if the material is unworthy of the treatment. As a result, yes, it's a druggie comedy that made me laugh. Advertisement The heroes are a process server named Dale (Seth Rogen) and his drug dealer Saul (James Franco). Both are stoned in every single scene. Dale has a romance going with Angie (Amber Heard), who I hope is of legal age, although physical sex isn't necessarily involved. I think Dale is still at the age of emotional development where going all the way means asking a girl to go steady. Saul is even more pathetic, hiding in his apartment filled with electronic gizmos and merchandise. Dale drops in on Saul one day to buy some weed, and Saul gives him a sample of a new product just imported by his connection. This is Pineapple Express, a blend of marijuana so sublime, he says, that even smoking it is a crime \"like killing a unicorn.\" Dale gets high on the aroma alone. Floating away from Saul's after a hallucinatory conversation, he goes to serve a summons on Ted Jones (Gary Cole), the very man Saul gets his pot from. Parked in front of the house for one last toke, Dale is horrified to see a squad car parked behind him, and throws away the joint. Then he has a front-row seat to witness, through a huge glass wall, a man being shot dead by Ted and a female cop (Rosie Perez). He speeds away, leaving Ted to find the joint, sample it, identify it and realize that the murder witness bought it from Saul. The buddies know Ted will make this connection, and begin a desperate flight from Ted's incompetent hit men. This leads them into a funny stumble through a forest preserve, the loss of their car, and Dale's attempt to plausibly sit through dinner with Angie's parents (Ed Begley Jr. and Nora Dunn) while stoned, bleeding, torn, disheveled and in need of being hosed down. The critic James Berardinelli observes: \"A lot of buddy films aren't fundamentally that different from romantic comedies. The relationships are often developed in the same fashion, only with male bonding replacing sexual chemistry.\" Does that make Dale and Saul gay, even if they're not aware of it? I think that describes the buddies in a lot of buddy movies produced by Judd Apatow, including the recent \"Step Brothers.\" Especially in the obligatory happy ending, there's a whole lot of hugging and chanting of \"I love you, man!\" Advertisement A third major character enters the scene when Dale and Saul visit Saul's buddy Red (Danny McBride), who has already betrayed them to the hit men. All of this leads, don't ask how, to a full-scale war between Ted's men and a rival drug empire, \"The Asians,\" who attack conveniently dressed in matching black uniforms, which makes them easy targets under the sun lamps of Ted's indoor pot farm. Many, many people die horribly, none more thoroughly than poor Rosie Perez. Two teams have met to make this picture: the Apatow production line, and Green and his cameraman Tim Orr, soundman Chris Gebert, actor Danny McBride and others he met at the North Carolina School of the Arts. As always, even in their zero-budget first effort, Green and Orr use wide-screen compositions with graceful visual instincts, although you may be excused for not noticing them, considering what happens. The movie even transcends the usual chase, this time between two squad cars. To my amazement, I found it exciting and very funny, especially the business about Saul's leg. \"Pineapple Express\" is the answer to the question, \"What would happen if a movie like this was made by a great director?\" This question descends directly from those old rumors that Stanley Kubrick was going to make a porn film. Give it a moment's thought. And I suspect Green of foiling Apatow's vow to include at least one penis in every one of his comedies. This time, it's not a penis, but a finger, and a good thing, too. Be aware:\u00a0Despite a \"warning,\" the movie is enthusiastically pro-pot."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Iron Man", "Review": "When I caught up with \"Iron Man,\" a broken hip had delayed me and the movie had already been playing for three weeks. What I heard during that time was that a lot of people loved it, that they were surprised to love it so much, and that Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was special. Apart from that, all I knew was that the movie was about a big iron man. I didn't even know that a human occupied it, and halfway thought that the Downey character's brain had been transplanted into a robot, or a fate equally weird. Advertisement \tYes, I knew I was looking at sets and special effects--but I'm referring to the reality of the illusion, if that make any sense. With many superhero movies, all you get is the surface of the illusion. With \"Iron Man,\" you get a glimpse into the depths. You get the feeling, for example, of a functioning corporation. Consider the characters of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Stark's loyal aide, and Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), Stark's business partner. They don't feel drummed up for the occasion. They seem to have worked together for awhile. \tMuch of that feeling is created by the chemistry involving Downey, Paltrow and Bridges. They have relationships that seem fully-formed and resilient enough to last through the whole movie, even if plot mechanics were not about to take them to another level. Between the two men, there are echoes of the relationship between Howard Hughes and Noah Dietrich in Scorsese's \"The Aviator\" (2004). Obadiah Stane doesn't come onscreen waving flags and winking at the camera to announce he is the villain; he seems adequately explained simply as the voice of reason at Stark's press conference. (Why did \"Stark,\" during that scene, make me think of \"staring mad?\"). Between Stark and Pepper, there's that classic screen tension between \"friends\" who know they can potentially become lovers. \tDowney's performance is intriguing, and unexpected. He doesn't behave like most superheroes: he lacks the psychic weight and gravitas. Tony Stark is created from the persona Downey has fashioned through many movies: irreverent, quirky, self-deprecating, wise-cracking. The fact that Downey is allowed to think and talk the way he does while wearing all that hardware represents a bold decision by the director, Jon Favreau. If he hadn't desired that, he probably wouldn't have hired Downey. So comfortable is Downey with Tony Stark's dialogue, so familiar does it sound coming from him, that the screenplay seems almost to have been dictated by Downey's persona. Advertisement \tThere are some things that some actors can safely say onscreen, and other things they can't. The Robert Downey Jr. persona would find it difficult to get away with weighty, profound statements (in an \"entertainment,\" anyway--a more serious film like \"Zodiac\" is another matter). Some superheroes speak in a kind of heightened, semi-formal prose, as if dictating to Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. Not Tony Stark. He could talk that way and be Juno's uncle. \"Iron Man\" doesn't seem to know how seriously most superhero movies take themselves. If there is wit in the dialog, the superhero is often supposed to be unaware of it. If there is broad humor, it usually belongs to the villain. What happens in \"Iron Man,\" however, is that sometimes we wonder how seriously even Stark takes it. He's flippant in the face of disaster, casual on the brink of ruin. \tIt's prudent, I think, that Favreau positions the rest of the characters in a more serious vein. The supporting cast wisely does not try to one-up him. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Potts as a woman who is seriously concerned that this goofball will kill himself. Jeff Bridges makes Obadiah Stane one of the great superhero villains by seeming plausibly concerned about the stock price. Terrence Howard, as Col. Rhodes, is at every moment a conventional straight arrow. What a horror show it would have been if they were all tuned to Tony Stark's sardonic wave length. We'd be back in the world of \"Swingers\" (1996) which was written by Favreau. \tAnother of the film's novelties is that the enemy is not a conspiracy or spy organization. It is instead the reality in our own world today: Armaments are escalating beyond the ability to control them. In most movies in this genre, the goal would be to create bigger and better weapons. How unique that Tony Stark wants to disarm. It makes him a superhero who can think, reason and draw moral conclusions, instead of one who recites platitudes. \tThe movie is largely founded on its special effects. When somebody isn\u2019t talking, something is banging, clanging or laying rubber. The armored robotic suits utilized by Tony and Obadiah would upstage lesser actors than Downey and Bridges; it's surprising how much those two giant iron men seem to reflect the personalities of the men inside them. Everything they do is preposterous, of course, but they seem to be doing it, not the suits. Some of their moments have real grandeur--as when Tony tests his suit to see how high it will fly, and it finally falls back toward earth in a sequence that reminded me of a similar challenge in \"The Right Stuff.\" The art direction is inspired by the original Marvel artists. The movie doesn't reproduce the drawings of Jack Kirby and others, but it reproduces their feeling, a vision of out-scale enormity, seamless sleekness, secret laboratories made not of nuts and bolts but of...vistas. Advertisement \tA lot of big budget f/x epics seem to abandon their stories with half an hour to go, and just throw effects at the audience. This one has a plot so ingenious it continues to function no matter how loud the impacts, how enormous the explosions. It\u2019s an inspiration to provide Tony with that heart-saving device; he\u2019s vulnerable not simply because Obadiah might destroy him, but because he might simply run out of juice. \tThat leaves us, however, with a fundamental question at the bottom of the story: Why must the ultimate weapon be humanoid in appearance? Why must it have two arms and two legs, and why does it matter if its face is scowling? In the real-world competitions between fighting machines, all the elements of design are based entirely on questions of how well they allow the machines to attack, defend, recover, stay upright, and overturn their enemies. It is irrelevant whether they have conventional eyes, or whether those eyes narrow. Nor does it matter whether they have noses, because their oxygen supply is obviously not obtained by breathing. \tThe solution to such dilemmas is that the armored suits look the way they do for entirely cinematic reasons. The bad iron man should look like a mean machine. The good iron man should utilize the racing colors of Tony Stark's favorite sports cars. It wouldn't be nearly as much fun to see a fight scene between two refrigerators crossed with the leftovers from a boiler room. \tAt the end of the day it 's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies. You hire an actor for his strengths, and Downey would not be strong as a one-dimensional mighty-man. He is strong because he is smart, quick and funny, and because we sense his public persona masks deep private wounds. By building on that, Favreau found his movie, and it's a good one."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "On the Road", "Review": "Although Jack Kerouac's \u201cOn the Road\u201d has been praised as a milestone in American literature, this film version brings into question how much of a story it really offers. Kerouac's hero, Sal Paradise, becomes transfixed by the rambling outlaw vision of a charismatic car thief, Dean Moriarity, and joins him in a series of journeys from his mother's apartment in Ozone Park, N.Y., as they crisscross the continent to Chicago, Denver, San Francisco and then back again, until it occurs to Dean \u201cI've never been south.\u201d They turn to Mexico, finding in its long, straight cactus-lined roads, some secret to themselves. They also find marijuana; the two may not be unrelated. Advertisement These journeys also yield forth booze, women and jazz \u2014 which contain their own secrets, but not simply through the searching for them. Along the way, Dean seeks his dead father and exudes so much charisma that the real Dean, Neal Cassady, is said to be the inspiration for the Beat Generation. Published in 1957, \u201cOn the Road\u201d grew not into a movement but into a brand; Kerouac was a frequent guest on talk shows, and the Beats made the cover of Life magazine \u2014 a group of Beats seen sitting on a floor next to an LP player, wearing black turtlenecks, dark glasses and a look of intense cool. Compared to the Lost Generation and the Me Generation, the Beats were thin tea.  As a teenager,  I snatched up the book in its first paperback edition and chose it above any other to display on my desk at the News-Gazette, sometimes underlining trenchant passages. Still in high school, I slipped away to the Turk's Head, a campus coffee shop, which played Miles Davis and Monk, and Beats were rumored by the townspeople to stand on the tables and recite their poetry, although table-standing seems to run counter to the Beat ethos. My friends and I, newly in possession of our first $450 cars, talked idly of pointing them west and not stopping until we reached the Pacific. Whether this mission matched Mark Twain's \u201clighting out for the territory,\u201d you may decide. The Brazilian director Walter Salles is drawn to the notion of young men on epic journeys of self-discovery; his \u201cThe Motorcycle Diaries\u201d (2004) involved Che Guevara  on a tour of South America that shaped his ideas of South America. In \u201cOn the Road,\u201d Kerouac (the British actor Sam Riley) is more interested in how he was shaped by Dean Moriarty (Garrett Hedlund).  Dean in this movie is a rumpled, laconic young man whose fascination for Sal was his inclination to boost cars and set off on journeys to the horizon in search of girls. The girls would be wise to hide when they see these boys coming. Kerouac's wife, Carolyn (known as Camille here and well played by Kirsten Dunst), is given a scene not long after their child is born. \u201cDean and I are going out,\u201d Sal tells her. \u201cWant to come along?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she says, \u201cI'll stay and look after baby.\u201d  Advertisement Having a second thought on his way out, he pokes his head back through he door: \u201c At least I asked if you wanted to go.\u201d She fixes him with a Kirsten Dunst glare and says, \u201cI know the look on your face. You're sick of me and you're sick of the baby. Do you realize how much I've given up for you?\u201d No, he doesn't. Is his bond with Sal homosexual at its core? The film itself remains ambiguous.  Their long distance trips become epic, mostly in an unimaginably big and sleek Hudson, later in a beat-up Cadillac, they pass vast empty landscapes, pick up hitchhikers, stop in roadside diners, and on the whole have about as much excitement in San Francisco as you'd expect a couple of broke out-of-towners to experience.  The film's last scene is the payoff we expect. Confronting his typewriter, Sal inserts one end of a very long roll of paper and starts to type: \u201cI first met Dean\u2026\u201d"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Sixty Six", "Review": "The year 1966, as few Americans can be expected to know, is the year England won the World Cup. It is also the year that 12-year-old Bernie Rubens is going to be celebrating his bar mitzvah in London. This will be an event lasting two days, his blind rabbi tells him. He will become a man, catch the eye of God, be showered with presents and climax when he is the center of the universe at his own party. In what the director, Paul Weiland, calls \"a true-ish story\" based on his own life, Bernie has the rotten luck to select for his party July 30, 1966, the day England won the World Cup. Advertisement Of course England has no chance to get into the finals, right? They're like the Cubs. But in 1966, against all odds, England somehow did win the final game, and as for the Cubs, who knows? Bernie is placed in the peculiar position of being the only person in the nation who hopes England loses. Devout Jew that he is, he sneaks in a book of heathen chants and spells and evokes demon spirits against the national team.\r\"Sixty Six\" is a warm-hearted story about a boy coming of age in a particularly tragic way: Who in the world would rather come to his party than watch the final match on the telly? Bernie (Gregg Sulkin) is crushed. He has always been the underdog, the last to be picked, the one with glasses, the butt of jokes by his brother Alvie.\rBefore he discovers the fateful date coincidence, he maps out his party: a formal dinner for 350, a full orchestra. He even invites Frankie Vaughan to sing (for free, I think) and writes to the famous criminals, the Kray brothers, for their assistance. Then bad luck steps in. His father Manny (Eddie Marsan) and Uncle Jimmy (Peter Serafinowicz) are forced to sell their grocery store when a supermarket opens next door. A fireworks rocket set off after an England victory starts a fire in the Rubens' attic and burns up his dad's life savings. The party has to be scaled way back, held at home, catered by his aunt, who makes a canape they cannot identify as potato, chicken or fish.\rYes, the movie is predictable. England will play in the final game, and the bar-mitzvah party will be far from Bernie's dreams. But Weiland somehow extracts the real meaning of a bar mitzvah from the wreckage. Central to the whole story is the love of Bernie's mother, Esther (Helen Bonham Carter, surprising us by seeming born to the role). She encourages her hangdog husband during a series of setbacks. Esther puts a good face on things. And she unveils an astonishing vocabulary as one family friend after another telephones with a bogus excuse for not being able to attend.\rThe story line sounds plain and simple, but the movie is enlightened by Bernie's impassioned narration and by a gallery of small comic details. While Manny is a morose loser, for example, his brother Jimmy is a popular back-slapper and specialist in Jewish humor. Example: \"Ask me how I am.\" \"How are you?\" \"Don't ask!\"\rThe blind Rabbi Linov (Richard Katz) excels at answering Bernie's questions about God's position on the World Cup (\"I don't think it's covered in the Old Testament.\"). And Stephen Rea, as Bernie's asthma doctor, has a nice scene where he and Bernie puff through straws at a tabletop soccer ball, and their game is intercut with a real one.\r\"Sixty Six\" isn't a great movie, but confident of its material and lucky in its casting. Eddie Marsan, for example, has more ways of looking discontented than most repertory companies. One question: Bernie is a bright kid. Why doesn't he just shift the date of his party?"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies", "Review": "Like the novel \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies,\u201d the movie \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies\u201d is predicated on a simple, single gimmick: It\u2019s \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d \u2026 with zombies. This is a vaguely amusing idea which somehow got stretched out to an entire book, which somehow became a best seller, which inevitably means it had to be made into a film. It is essentially Jane Austen\u2019s classic tale of social mores and machinations in 19th\u00a0century England, down to characters, settings, plot points and specific bits of dialogue, only with the pesky inclusion of the undead popping up here and there to complicate matters further (authorship for the project goes cheekily to both Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith.) While the 2009 book played this genre mash-up for dry, sly laughs, writer-director Burr Steers\u2019 film amps up the thrills and gore. And that\u2019s a problem\u2014not necessarily as a narrative choice, but from a technical perspective. Advertisement What differentiates \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies\u201d from its literary source material is its big action sequences, but they\u2019re staged, lit, shot and edited in such muddled fashion, it\u2019s often difficult to tell what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s no visual context to the assaults and no way to determine their source or size, which depletes these scenes of their tension, making it impossible to become engaged. Sometimes this is intentional, as in Steers\u2019 frequent use of blurriness right at the point of when a zombie is about to devour someone, but it doesn\u2019t work in those instances, either. Too often, \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies\u201d is so darkened as to be inscrutable, as in a basement scene when the Bennet sisters are bantering while sparring in preparation for the next possible attack\u2014the women have to worry about both marrying the right man and not being eaten.\u00a0 In case it\u2019s been a while since you read the book in high school English class: \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d centers on headstrong Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James), the second-oldest of five daughters of average means who\u2019s not nearly so obsessed with marrying up as her mother (Sally Phillips) is. While her beautiful older sister, Jane (Bella Heathcote), becomes romantically involved with the handsome and obscenely wealthy Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth), Lizzie enters into a love-hate relationship with Bingley\u2019s close friend, the even more obscenely wealthy Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley). Social classes clash and sparks fly. Misunderstandings arise but eventually clear up, characters are forced to admit to both their pride and their prejudice, and everyone lives happily ever after. In the zombified version, though, the Bennet girls have all been trained as warriors, and the social-strata element comes into play in regards to the location where that training takes place (Japan for the elite, China for everyone else). George Wickham (Jack Huston) isn\u2019t just predatory and untrustworthy, he also might not be entirely alive. And the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh (a fierce, sleek Lena Headey) is the most celebrated zombie-killer of them all\u2014with an eye patch to prove it. Sometimes, this mixture works\u2014mainly in the quieter, calmer moments, as when the characters sit around a drawing room cleaning their guns or one-upping each other while comparing their expertise in the deadly arts. And as the sisters dress in their finest gowns and style their hair for a ball, they also carefully slide daggers into their garters for protection. The small, deadpan moments in Steers\u2019 script have more of an impact than the massive, noisy set pieces. Advertisement Through it all, though, James is a delight to watch as Lizzie. If you saw her last year in Kenneth Branagh\u2019s \u201cCinderella,\u201d you know how hugely appealing she can be. Here, she\u2019s playing a very different kind of iconic figure, but in both cases there\u2019s something pure about her screen presence that makes her seem accessible and true. And she has decent chemistry with Riley as the arrogant, abrasive Darcy\u2014but then again, several of their key exchanges take place within the context of some sort of physical fight, either with each other or against the stumbling, mumbling undead, which detracts from their inherent romantic tension rather than enhancing it. It\u2019s a tricky thing to pull off, this delicate balance of tone. Very few directors could do it successfully, but it seems Steers\u2014whose eclectic filmography ranges from \u201cIgby Goes Down\u201d to \u201c17 Again\u201d to \u201cCharlie St. Cloud\u201d\u2014wasn\u2019t quite ready to expand his repertoire this far. Maybe someone else can crack the code to the ultimate Austen mash-up when the inevitable \u201cSense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters\u201d adaption comes along."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine", "Review": "\"Matt Shepard is a Friend of Mine\" is a great documentary. It might face an uphill battle to be seen, because it revisits\u00a0a crime that sparked\u00a0national\u00a0reckoning\u00a0with the\u00a0reality\u00a0of homophobia, and that eventually led to the creation of The Matthew Shepard Foundation and the passage of the\u00a0Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\u00a0I hope people discover it. It is wrenching but never exploitive. It\u00a0is impressively skeptical of the same mission that it takes on its shoulders: to make something positive from a senseless crime without\u00a0diminishing\u00a0its senselessness. This film doesn't just revisit an atrocity, it moves through it, and finds meaning in it.\u00a0 Advertisement The story starts on the night of\u00a0Oct. 12, 1998, when Shepard, a 21-year old college student, was offered a ride home by two young men,\u00a0Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, then tied to a fence, viciously beaten, and abandoned. Shepard died of his injuries. In the ensuing trial,\u00a0McKinney\u2019s lawyer tried to keep his client out of prison through the \"gay-panic defense,\" in which defendants who think they've been the object of homosexual advances claim they were seized by \"a\u00a0psychotic state characterized by unusual violence.\"\u00a0 Director Michele Josue, who knew Shepard, frames the story as\u00a0her own meditation on Shepard's life and death. This would seem self-aggrandizing if the filmmaker didn't quickly move beyond herself and distribute her attention democratically among Shepard's family and friends. In the second half, she widens the film's scope and shows how the news of the crime and trial affected strangers: not just gays and lesbians who saw Shepard's killing as a worst-case-scenario projection of their own experiences with harassment and violence (a teary-eyed Ellen DeGeneres is glimpsed briefly at a public memorial service), but anyone who was offended by displays of ignorant savagery, and frustrated by the tendency of America's legal system and popular culture to make excuses for them. Much of the film is about Shepard coming to terms with his sexual orientation, then getting beyond his cultural roots and building his own identity. His mother Judy remembers how the young Matt Shepard always wanted to dress as Dolly Parton on Halloween\u2014she worries that this is a stereotypical signifier, but still seems moved by the memory\u2014and his father Dennis recounts his own no-big-deal reaction to his son's decision to come out to him. We learn that Shepard traveled the world, and we hear loved ones reading aloud from letters he wrote to them. In an especially affecting passage, we learn that Shepard was raped by several men in an alley in Morocco, an event that influenced his decision to move back home to Wyoming. Advertisement Throughout, \"Matt Shepard Was a Friend of Mine\" does an admirable job of taking a man who's been turned into a symbol and making him a man again\u2014a young man. We get a sense of a life unfolding before us, a personality shifting and changing, a voice finding itself: the middle section of the movie, which focuses on Shepard's personal evolution, is one of the best examples I've seen recently of cinema's ability to universalize a singular experience.\u00a0No matter who you are or where you come from, you'll probably see yourself represented in some part of Shepard's life\u2014which makes that same life's premature extinction all the more saddening, of course. The film also captures that aching void left by a sudden death: that sense that a hole has been torn in reality. The sense of dislocation is felt most keenly in scenes that deal with Shepard's younger brother, Logan, who adored him.\u00a0 Without putting too fine a point on it, the film also asks what it means to be truly Christian, as opposed to distorting Christianity as a cover for hate.\u00a0Concepts of\u00a0acceptance\u00a0(not \"tolerance\") and forgiveness are never far from its mind, and\u00a0these move into the foreground when Josue speaks to\u00a0Father Roger Schmit, who counseled one of Shepard's killers. Schmit tells her that forgiving those who've done wrong to us doesn't mean letting go of anger\u2014that righteous anger at injustice can be a force that gives shape to grief, and turns it into something positive, forward-thinking, healing. \u00a0It's overwhelming in the best way\u2014an observation so simple and profound that stops the film in its tracks. To her credit, Josue lets it stop, and just sits with Schmit's revelations for a while, and lets them sink into the movie, and our minds.\u00a0 The film's title reveals its world view, and its mission: not \"Matt Shepard was,\" but \"Matt Shepard is.\""}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Bronx Gothic", "Review": "How much work does it take to love yourself as a woman in modern society? How much effort must one put forth to shut out the deafening howl of discrimination and accept oneself as a woman of color, an unapologetically sexual being or a girl who isn\u2019t deemed as conventionally pretty? These questions have recently been tackled in indelible ways by brilliant female artists working within the realm of dance. Under the choreography of Ryan Heffington, Maddie Ziegler exposed the messy emotions trapped within the commoditized faces of women in the acclaimed music videos for Sia tunes such as \u201cChandelier\u201d and \u201cBig Girls Cry.\u201d Bobbi Jene Smith obliterated the shame so often associated with sexuality in her electrifying performance piece, \u201cA Study on Effort,\u201d the evolution of which can be witnessed in Elvira Lind\u2019s Tribeca prize-winning documentary, \u201cBobbi Jene.\u201d Though Okwui Okpokwasili\u2019s performance piece, \u201cBronx Gothic,\u201d is filled with words\u2014both spoken and sung\u2014the first half-hour is comprised entirely of its solo performer dancing silently in a corner of the stage, her back turned to the audience. This radical decision inevitably frustrates some audience members (one man is overheard groaning, \u201cShoot me now\u201d), but its hypnotic effect proves to be transformative for those willing to lose themselves in the person standing and convulsing before them.\u00a0 Advertisement In an era when so many technological distractions are vying for our attention, Okpokwasili challenges us to keep our eyes focused on her until we, in a sense, \u201cbecome\u201d her. The first third of her performance serves as a sort of overture, fully immersing us in the mood of the piece before a single word is uttered. The intimate venues where \u201cBronx Gothic\u201d is performed enable Okpokwasili to make eye contact with her audience when she finally turns to face them. She gazes at the seated observers in a way that forces them to consider how they may be read by their mere appearance, a thought that consistently crosses the minds of black women in America. Her goal is to take the viewers off of their protected, elevated perch in the darkness and bring them into her world\u2014the one from her past that continues to haunt her present existence.\u00a0 Recounting a coming-of-age yarn set in her childhood home of the Bronx, the show is perhaps most poignant when performed in its own location. Even the safe space of the theater can\u2019t prevent the sounds of subway trains and ambulance sirens from blaring through the walls, much like how the security of the Parkchester neighborhood where Okpokwasili grew up wasn\u2019t immune to the threat of violence. Yet no matter where \u201cBronx Gothic\u201d happens to be staged, the \u201cporous boundary\u201d separating Okpokwasili from her audience is repeatedly blurred. When a fleck of sweat or saliva happens to be flung from the performer onto a member of the crowd, it\u2019s the externalization of Okpokwasili\u2019s intent to have her \u201cblackness get on\u201d the people in attendance until they are consumed. No filmed footage could replicate the experience of watching \u201cBronx Gothic\u201d live, but documentarian Andrew Rossi does an admirable job of channeling its power in his movie of the same name. It\u2019s not as adventurous or as thorough a portrait as \u201cBobbi Jene,\u201d and there are areas where it is conspicuously lacking. As Rossi follows Okpokwasili during the final three-month tour of her show, we catch glimpses of her husband and frequent collaborator, Peter Born. He served as the director of \u201cBronx Gothic,\u201d but we get little sense of his working relationship with Okpokwasili, aside from one tense conversation regarding the arguable merits of a \u201cRoots\u201d remake. Born questions why so many \u201cblack films\u201d tend to be about oppression, leading his wife to argue that the ahistorical attitudes pervading American culture necessitate reminders of our country\u2019s systemic prejudice. The picture may have been enriched by more conversations between this couple, though we are supplied instead with interactions that are nearly as compelling. There\u2019s some very funny banter courtesy of Okpokwasili\u2019s mother, who balks at how her daughter refuses to take a break during the 90-minute performance (\u201cDo they have a doctor there?\u201d she quips), as well as some moving responses from audience members at talkbacks.\u00a0 Advertisement Throughout the film, Okpokwasili is surprisingly candid in voicing her intentions behind each artistic choice in the show, which she insists is not an autobiography but a character piece loosely based on her life and the lives of girls that she knew. As the director of NYC profiles including \u201cPage One: Inside the New York Times\u201d and \u201cThe First Monday in May,\u201d Rossi is skilled at involving us in the process of creation, and the best moments in this film juxtapose thrilling performance excerpts with the concepts from which they sprung. The term \u201cGothic\u201d in the title is meant to evoke the forbidden spaces where one accidentally enters, culminating in the end of innocence. Once Okpokwasili arrives at the mic, she reads selections of the correspondence that her character supposedly had with her best friend when they were 11 years old in the Bronx. There\u2019s a frankness to the girls\u2019 discussion of their budding sexuality that is both amusing and refreshing, encouraging youth to not be ashamed of their developing bodies. Okpokwasili was pregnant with her daughter when she wrote the show, an added factor that fueled her desire to revolt against the puritanical fear of educated women. Keeping girls ignorant about their own physical functions merely leaves them vulnerable to the predatory forces in society. At the heart of the piece is Okpokwasili\u2019s need to \u201cauthor herself into existence,\u201d allowing women of color to have their lives acknowledged and validated in a world that \u201cprivileges whiteness.\u201d In a riveting montage, Rossi fuses images of mutilated slaves with the recent murders of men like Eric Garner, as Okpokwasili describes the ontological crisis spurred by the endless cycle of watching black bodies be destroyed without consequence. Her stated question of whether she exists if her existence can be so easily erased lends an overarching spiritual component to the show that crystallizes in the final act. As the girls\u2019 identities start to fragment and combine, we wonder whether they are actually shades of the same person, or if they are reflections of ourselves as well.\u00a0 Rossi\u2019s \u201cBronx Gothic\u201d is a stirring ode to the liberating catharsis of artistic expression, as embodied by Okpokwasili and Born\u2019s transcendent theatrical masterwork. A lingering question raised by the picture is how black male bodies can cease to be branded as threats, considering how their tough exteriors are so often acquired for the purposes of self-preservation. I was reminded of a good friend whom I walked with many times through the city of Chicago. As we\u00a0chatted enthusiastically about a variety of topics, he often paused to compliment a passerby or help a family carry a box to their door. I also noticed how the pace in his step would slow on occasion, causing the distance to widen between him and the lone pedestrian ahead of us. When I asked him why he did these things, he told me that as a black man, it was imperative that he go out of his way to avoid being perceived as scary or ill-intentioned. The effort that he put forth on a daily basis boggled my mind and broke my heart. I can\u2019t think of a better example for why the work of artists like Okpokwasili is not only beneficial but entirely indispensable. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Sandy Wexler", "Review": "\u201cSandy Wexler\u201d marks the third Netflix Original Film starring Adam Sandler (and his friends) and second directed by Steven Brill. To say it\u2019s the best of Sandler's three is only indicative of how unbearably awful the first two attempts were. Unlike \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d and \u201cThe Do-Over,\u201d there\u2019s some stuff here that works, and you can even, believe it or not, see glimpses of the Sandler who has put effort into films like \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d and \u201cFunny People.\u201d This is Sandler\u2019s first actual Netflix performance. It\u2019s in a film that still sucks. Advertisement It took until this movie for me to realize that Netflix should be pissed. What I\u2019ve come to notice as the critic of all of the Happy Madison Netflix films is that the creators of these movies, Sandler in particular, saw Netflix as a place to lower their efforts. And those efforts weren\u2019t too high when these films were going theatrical. Everything has felt like a first draft. Every scene goes on longer than it needs to as if no one ever considered the timing of the final product because, well, it\u2019s just Netflix. Running times over two hours; jokes that seem like they\u2019re never going to end; supporting roles filled by buddies who often look like they\u2019re just there for the catering\u2014well, it\u2019s just Netflix. Sandler plays the title character, a low-level talent manager in the \u201890s\u2014one of his major clients is \u201cthe guy who got his heart ripped out of his chest in 'Temple of Doom'\u201d\u2014who is being remembered by friends and colleagues at some sort of modern day gathering that\u2019s unclear.

Yes, it\u2019s the weirdest collection of people at a party in Hollywood history. And it\u2019s an even stranger structure in that the writers often give this crew the same thing to say over and over again. Sandy ate like a slob and laughed awkwardly, but he cared greatly about the people he managed, a ragtag crew of entertainers on the edge of the business. Sandy\u2019s clients include a ventriloquist who is always with his dummies (Kevin James), a daredevil who sucks at his job (Nick Swardson), and a mediocre stand-up comedian (Colin Quinn). None of them are particularly talented, but Wexler never tells them that, and there\u2019s an interesting story that develops in the film about the tragedy of living life as a yes-man. At a certain point, you have to say no and you have to help people face the reality of a fame-less life. That story is a subplot to the much greater arc of Courtney (Jennifer Hudson), an R&B singer who Sandy discovers at a theme park and turns into a massive star. Of course, Courtney becomes too big for Sandy. Of course, Sandy secretly loves Courtney. Of course, all of this is connected by wacky interludes meant to be funny, but you will very rarely laugh. Advertisement There\u2019s a halfway decent and interesting 90-minute dramedy buried in this 131-minute film, but Brill again shows his complete lack of pacing and timing. Over 90 minutes into this thing, you\u2019re watching Terry Crews punch another man in the ass in one of many asides about Wexler\u2019s clients. The film has zero sense of build or moving toward anything because it has that Brill, lurching momentum. There\u2019s an earlier bit about jumping in a forbidden pool that goes on forever. And there are at least a hundred jokes out of a \u201cWacky \u201890s\u201d joke book, including recurring bits about how wrong Wexler is about the future\u2014he advises a client to pull all of his money out of Apple and put it in small local bookstores. And, of course, it wouldn\u2019t be set in the \u201890s without an OJ joke. \u201890s fringe celebrities pop up repeatedly. Having Arsenio Hall play himself once is kinda funny\u2014four times not as much. But the fact is that Brill and Sandler never wrote a joke that they didn\u2019t think was worth repeating until you were sick of it.  And yet this film is definitely not as easy to quickly dismiss as Sandler's last two Netflix joints. It\u2019s interesting to consider that Sandler came up in the \u201890s, and that a lot of the people involved in memories of this fictional character were much bigger then (I\u2019m looking at you, Vanilla Ice and Pauly Shore). In a sense, Sandler has always lived in the past\u2014it\u2019s the core of most of his man-child comedies, especially \u201cGrown Ups\u201d\u2014and so seeing him play a character who\u2019s somewhat stuck in an outdated existence has a meta quality that could have been fascinating but feels underdeveloped.  That\u2019s what all these movies are\u2014underdeveloped. They\u2019re lazy. That this one is more interesting than the previous ventures almost feels accidental at times. Still, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that \u201cSandy Wexler\u201d could have been Adam Sandler\u2019s most complex film in years, but \u2026 well, it\u2019s just Netflix."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Lies We Tell", "Review": "This glum, poorly organized crime drama has a not-unpromising premise. Harvey Keitel plays a businessman of Greek extraction named Demi\u00a0(with a New York accent for all that), living in Britain. Donald, portrayed by a downcast Gabriel Byrne, is his driver, a loyal attendant. Demi dies very suddenly\u2014about five minutes in\u2014although it takes a while to be sure, because the movie just cuts to a funeral. Could be anybody. But you get that a lot with this movie. In any event, a couple minutes later we learn it is indeed Demi who is dead. \u201cI ask for your assistance with regard to the apartment and its contents. Please be sure there are no undesirable repercussions as a result of my indiscetions.\u201d Apartment? The place that Donald has to clear out looks more like a gated house, but whatever. Advertisement In any event, the person he has to expel from the place is Amber (Sibylla Deen). A beauty of Pakistani descent, Demi\u2019s mistress. She shows up at the place while Donald is waiting. Donald spies on Amber a while, and then reveals himself to her\u2014she\u2019s startled of course\u2014and tells her he has to \u201cclear out.\u201d In the role of non-gentleman\u2019s gentleman, Donald possesses little aplomb. He immediately alienates Amber, and then offers her a lift, because he feels a little bad about it. He drives Amber to her Bradford hood, where all kinds of shady stuff goes down. Within minutes Donald is pulled over by police, and Amber gets the crap kicked out of her, in two completely separate incidents. Later, Amber tells Donald that there may be a sex tape on Demi\u2019s phone. \u201cIf they\u2019re deleted you don\u2019t have anything to worry about do you?\u201d shrugs Donald. \u201cHe USUALLY deletes them,\u201d Amber responds.    So here\u2019s an interesting suspense hook: will this movie show us Harvey Keitel in a simulated sex tape? Well, soon enough, every peripheral character in the movie is watching a shirtless Keitel doing some non-explicit cavorting. But other story concerns develop. Donald is divorcing, acrimoniously. Amber\u2019s younger sister is stuck in an arranged marriage scheme with a slimy gangster cousin. Without giving the two characters much actual reason to\u2014the movie has a slight antecedent in Neil Jordan\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d but that picture ran on an engine of ill-advised amorous obsession\u2014Donald and Amber form an alliance.    Lead actors Byrne and Deen do grounded, stalwart work, and director Mitu Misra occasionally succeeds in making the characters\u2019 milieu\u2019s register with force. But the storytelling is rickety. Characters are introduced willy-nilly and viewers don\u2019t find out their place in the movie\u2019s scheme until much, much later. There\u2019s a way in which the whole thing just fails to hold together. The themes of cultural difference are certainly pertinent, and the movie is eager to face up to them. At one point, Amber\u2019s mom asks her, in disgust, \u201cWhy are you judging us by British standards?\u201d Amber\u2019s own ambitions\u2014it\u2019s revealed in the middle of the movie that Demi was putting her through law school, and they mutually promised to end that affair once the achievement was unlocked\u2014are frustrated, with extreme prejudice, on all sides.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Other Woman", "Review": "Nick Cassavetes hasn\u2019t exactly made his name with laugh riots. The son of John Cassavetes, he\u2019s probably best known for directing such weepy melodramas as the massively successful \"The Notebook\" (2004) as well as \"My Sister\u2019s Keeper\" (2009), in which adorable Abigail Breslin seeks emancipation from her parents so she no longer has to help keep her leukemia-stricken sister alive. (Bring tissues.) So it\u2019s surprising that \"The Other Woman\" is indeed as funny as it is\u2014at least, in sporadic spurts. Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann enjoy some sparky chemistry as the mistress and wife who discover they\u2019re both in love with the same man. Trouble is, Cassavetes\u2014working from a script by Melissa K. Stack\u2014veers wildly between cautionary tale, revenge comedy, scatological raunchfest and female empowerment drama. Its trio of wronged women banding together and seeking redemption frequently calls to mind \"The First Wives Club,\" which was similarly uneven in its zingy one-liners and contrived plot points. Advertisement But \"The Other Woman\" is reminiscent of another movie which also happened to come out in 1996: the made-for-TV true story \"Frequent Flyer,\" starring Jack Wagner as a romantic rogue of an airline pilot who\u2019s married to three different women in three different cities. (Please don\u2019t ask me why I remember this.) And the cad in question in \"The Other Woman,\" played by Danish hunk Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, happens to look distractingly like a younger version of Wagner with his blonde-haired, blue-eyed features and slick, cocky demeanor. In theory, the joy of watching this kind of movie comes from seeing such a smooth operator squirm as his schemes are revealed and destroyed. And for a while, Diaz and Mann make for a likable odd couple as co-conspirators\u2014two women who couldn\u2019t be more different clashing and connecting as they unite for a common cause. Their doubts and decisions come from recognizable places. But then there\u2019s a third woman, played by Sports Illustrated swimsuit supermodel Kate Upton, whose introduction unfortunately throws the whole movie into wacky, slapstick territory. You\u2019d think Diaz\u2019s character, tough-as-nails Manhattan attorney Carly Whitten, wouldn\u2019t abide by that kind of nonsense. (As Carly\u2019s tough-love assistant, Nicki Minaj is a scene-stealer in her first on-screen role; her performance is one of the film\u2019s few consistent pleasures.) A serial and unsatisfied dater, Carly thinks she\u2019s finally found the man of her dreams in Coster-Waldau\u2019s Mark King, who presents himself as a single and successful Internet entrepreneur. But when Mark bails at the last minute on plans to meet Carly\u2019s much-married father (Don Johnson) over drinks, Carly becomes suspicious. She shows up unannounced\u2014in hot pants, no less\u2014at his rambling, Cape Cod-style Connecticut home with plans to seduce him. Guess who answers the door? Mann\u2019s Kate, the stay-at-home wife Carly never knew Mark had. Advertisement While the leggy, blonde Carly is all monochromatic minimalism, the petite, redheaded Kate is downright Stepfordian in her Lilly Pulitzer-style pastel prints. (Veteran costume designer Patricia Field of \"Sex and the City\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada\" fame makes these characters\u2019 wardrobes pop distinctively.) Kate is also Carly\u2019s opposite in terms of personality: She\u2019s sweetly ditzy, a little needy and constantly chattering. Perhaps the contrast is a bit obvious but when the two women are on screen together\u2014at least for the first half of the film\u2014it works. Mann is constantly on her verge of a breakdown, a character trait she\u2019s exhibited previously in her husband, Judd Apatow\u2019s films\u2014particularly \"This Is 40.\" But here, she\u2019s honed the way she rides that edge and finds the confusion and humanity in Kate\u2019s state. She may be annoying as hell but at least she recognizes she\u2019s annoying as hell, which makes her strangely lovable. Kate stalks Carly and insists that they must be friends because the same man has deceived and betrayed them both. No one else could possibly sympathize with the turmoil they\u2019re going through. Strangely, this makes sense. They bond as women tend to bond in movies like this\u2014over shoes and tequila shots\u2014and at times it\u2019s hard to tell whether Cassavetes intends these sequences (which he often depicts in montage form) as an homage to a genre or a parody of it. The use of Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" as Kate and Carly find down-and-dirty ways to get even with Mark is so clich\u00e9d and on the nose, it\u2019s discombobulating. But the fun doesn\u2019t stop there. As they sneak around behind Mark\u2019s back and plot against him, they discover that he\u2019s involved with another other woman: Upton\u2019s twentysomething sexpot, whom they quickly clue in and befriend. Her name is Amber (of course) and she drives a Volkswagen Jetta (of course). That\u2019s about the extent of the characterization the script (or perhaps the editing process) affords her. Amber is a series of seismic curves, stuffed inside a teeny-weeny white bikini. Indeed, when we (and Carly and Kate) first see her, she\u2019s jogging along the Hamptons sand in the aforementioned swimwear\u2014in slow motion, naturally\u2014with shades of Bo Derek in \"10.\" (Hopefully that sequence didn\u2019t require a lot of takes, because it looks like it must have been painful for the buxom Upton.) Advertisement The model-turned-actress certainly has a likable enough screen presence but she\u2019s just not up for the challenge of performing alongside such seasoned comedians. (It makes you wonder what an actress like Alice Eve might have done with the role.) At least she\u2019s not alone in the eye candy department, though. Kate just happens to have a brother named Phil (Taylor Kinney of TV\u2019s \"Chicago Fire\") who\u2019s too good to be true: He\u2019s a handsome, smart, gentlemanly contractor who just happens to be single\u2014as if he\u2019s been waiting for Diaz\u2019s character his whole life. Such plot contrivances abound from this point, along with not one but two instances of characters, um, graphically relieving themselves at inopportune moments. The joke isn\u2019t funny the first time, and this kind of gross-out strain of comedy clangs uncomfortably with the feel-good message \"The Other Woman\" ostensibly is trying to convey. Any semblance of intelligent humor or insight into female aging that may have existed gets tossed out the window of Carly\u2019s high-rise office by the end, with Mark behaving like a petulant child throwing a temper tantrum. (Desperation does not suit Coster-Waldau.) While \"The Other Woman\" raises some thoughtful questions about independence, identity and the importance of sisterhood, ultimately it would rather poop on them and then throw them through a window in hopes of the getting the big laugh."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Herb & Dorothy 50x50", "Review": "\"Herb & Dorothy 50X50\" is like a more cheerful version of \"The Art of the Steal.\" That 2009 documentary chronicled how an art collection valued at over $25 billion was moved from its humble environs to a glitzy museum in violation of the express wishes of the person who collected it, and at great profit to the violators. The subjects of this film, Herb and Dorothy Vogel, were faced with similar circumstance, but responded in a way that averted disaster and benefited art fans throughout the country.  Advertisement The Vogels, whose intriguing story was depicted in the acclaimed 2008 documentary \"Herb & Dorothy,\" were an ordinary New York couple\u2014he a postal inspector and she a librarian. Starting in the early 1960s, they began an art collection with a heavy focus on the then-emerging field of modern, conceptual works, partly because they genuinely responded to those works and partly because they were affordable. Their collection grew to nearly 5000 pieces from artists ranging from well-known names like Roy Lichtenstein, Cindy Sherman and David Salle to those who never quite made it. All were stored in their one-bedroom, rent-controlled apartment. Most of the pieces were done on paper, but there are a few eye-popping shots of the apartment with stacks of paintings jammed into every available space.\u00a0 Eventually the collection proved to be too much, and the Vogels decided to donate it to the National Gallery of Art, but even that institution was incapable of handling such a bequest; even under the best of circumstances, most of the pieces would have wound up hidden away in storage. They devised an ingenious plan wherein 50 carefully selected pieces would be donated by the Vogels to a museum of their choice in every U.S. state. This would enable the works to be seen by people at venues that rarely received donations of that size and scope, or that have been struggling to simply survive in the face of an unsteady economy.  As the film watches the overseeing the distribution of their collection, the film quietly but effectively raises questions about the very nature of art collection and what responsibilities, if any, collectors have towards their purchases. The Vogels could have either sold their works to other private collectors, or to museums that would have most likely regarded them as just another acquisition to be filed away. By giving their collection away in the way that they have, the Vogels have found a more democratic method of dispersal, one that places artistic value over commercial considerations and allows others to experience the work in ways that will hopefully inspire them as much as they did the Vogels all those years ago. \u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement Some of the most amusing moments come from seeing the ways in which the donated art challenges those who have come to see them in their new surroundings. Some may be experiencing modern art for the very first time. Young children seem to respond the best, maybe because they have not yet been conditioned to think of abstract art as weird or difficult. The adults are more of a mixed bag. Some find a deep connection with the pieces. Others shrug them off. One man says, \"I tend to like the ones that are a little more finished.\"\u00a0 That said, some of the pieces perplex even their owners. At one point, Dorothy is seen checking a gallery's website, unsure if a black square is a blank spot where a picture of the work in question has yet to be added, or the work itself.  Directed by Megumi Sasaki, who also made \"Herb & Dorothy,\" \"Herb & Dorothy 50X50\" does not exactly reinvent the documentary form, though I would take its simple and unadorned style over the ham-fisted gibberish that is \"Salinger\" in a heartbeat. More importantly, the film taught me something of value about a subject that didn't much interest me before. Most of this is due to charm of the Vogels, a couple who dedicated their lives to something that they truly loved, then found a way to pass their enthusiasm on to others, in a manner consistent with their own directness and ability to surprise. As the saying goes, I may not know art, but I know what I like. I like this movie."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Gambler", "Review": "\u201cThe\u00a0Gambler\u201d should have been called \u201cThree Supporting Characters in Search of a Lead.\u201d A gaunt Mark Wahlberg stares out from the poster, his name is above the title, and he\u2019s in almost every frame of this remake, but his character may as well be non-existent. In scenes with Michael K. Williams, John Goodman and Alvin Ing, Wahlberg evaporates into thin air. The screenplay gives him one note to play, which becomes tiresome as the minutes drag on. While that trio of actors control entire sections of the orchestra, Wahlberg\u2019s Jim Bennett stands there waiting to ding out a note on a triangle. Advertisement This retooling of the 1974 James Caan film is completely devoid of the grit, nastiness and desperation of the Karel Reisz-James Toback original. Caan\u2019s character was memorable because one sensed that his film might do something awful to him, or worse, that his character might self-destruct and harm himself. By comparison, the 2014 version never indicates that it will maim and/or kill risk-taker Jim Bennett. It\u2019s too in love with his cocky, unflappable arrogance in the face of danger. No matter how dire the situation, Bennett\u2019s escape is never in doubt. This format works well for action movies and superhero yarns; not so much for dramas. \u201cThe\u00a0Gambler\u201d refuses to acknowledge that Bennett has a gambling addiction. It tries justifying Bennett\u2019s actions by tying them to the existential works he teaches in his college literature class. In that class is Amy (Brie Larson, so great in \u201cShort Term 12\u201d), whose character description sounds like it fell out of a filing cabinet at New World Pictures: College student by day, cocktail waitress in illegal gambling den by night. She knows of Bennett\u2019s reckless abandon with other people\u2019s money at the casino run by Mister Lee (Ing), and I guess it turns her on or something. It\u2019s as good an interpretation of her character as any, because Larson is given less to play here than she got in \u201cDon Jon\u201d. As Bennett digs deeper holes for himself, every confrontation between him and another character plays like a \u201cvery special episode\u201d of an 80\u2019s sitcom. People rant and rave at Bennett, calling him on the carpet for numerous offenses and mistakes as a means of teaching him a valuable lesson. Sometimes they rough him up a bit for emphasis. Then they completely forget about teaching lessons and bend to his will. Jessica Lange, as Bennett\u2019s super-rich Mom, slaps him around when he asks her for the $240,000 he needs to clean up his latest mess. Lange\u2019s over-the-top chastising scene would shame Joan Crawford, but she goes to the bank to get Bennett the money anyway. Advertisement Scenes like this occur with the aforementioned trio of Ing, Goodman and Williams, but they know how to toy with screenwriter William Monahan\u2019s preposterous, purple macho prose and posturing. They play the material at odd angles while Wahlberg plays it so straight he\u2019s upstaged at every turn. In these mini-movies, they become the stars and the lead becomes an extra. As Mister Lee, Ing delivers his lines in a smooth, ice cold fashion that\u2019s fun to watch. Goodman plays his entire role topless, and turns the F-word into poetry. Most effective of the trio is Williams, whose Neville serves as a charming mentor to Bennett without losing the \u201cdangerous Black man\u201d edge that Toback\u2019s earlier films liked to fetishize. Bennett borrows money from each of them, and since he\u2019s originally indebted to Lee\u2019s casino, Lee\u2019s loans are akin to borrowing from Peter to pay Peter. Every so often, one of the three shows up to inquire about\u00a0their money, and they\u2019re always one step ahead of Bennett. Each knows when he has borrowed from the other, as if a \u201cBennett Alert\u201d popped up on their phones prior to the scene. What I would have given for scenes where Ing, Goodman and Williams sat around exchanging information and laughing maniacally about how they can\u2019t hurt Bennett too badly lest they upset the audience. This movie should be about them. Since the plot hinges on whether Bennett can\u00a0successfully juggle all his schemes and make his big score pay off, it isn\u2019t unreasonable to ask that \u201cThe\u00a0Gambler\u201d get one\u2019s heart racing. But director Rupert Wyatt is too busy trying to be arty and daring with his visuals and soundtrack juxtapositions to think about pacing. In one unwise sequence, Dinah Washington\u2019s classic \u201cThis Bitter Earth\u201d plays over extraneous footage of writhing, naked strippers, leaving one to ask \u201cjust how bitter IS the earth in the Champagne Room?\u201d In another, Bennett runs what appears to be a marathon, only to arrive at a destination the movie wrongly assumes is bittersweet. Look, I get it. This is supposed to be some kind of fable-slash-parable. But even the wimpiest fairy tales have some form of credible threat. When various minions finally do pummel Bennett for his sins, I thought \u201ceh, he\u2019ll be all right.\u201d And he was. Where\u2019s the drama in that? Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Shut Up and Sing", "Review": "Maybe Natalie Maines\u2019 real problem was with her timing. On March 10, 2003, in the first days of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, she told a London audience, \u201cI\u2019m ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas.\u201d It took two weeks for that wisecrack to make it back home, but then it unleashed a perfect storm: Her group, The Dixie Chicks, had been the most popular female singing group in history, but suddenly disappeared from the playlists of virtually every country radio station in the land. Their #1 single, \u201cTraveling Soldier,\u201d dropped 47 percent in sales in one week. Many of their fans were vocal in their opinion that she should not have an opinion. Not long after, George W. Bush staged his premature \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d photo-op. Advertisement  As it happens, Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck were filming that London concert as part of a proposed film on the Chicks\u2019 world tour. Kopple usually chooses weightier subject matter, as with her \u201cHarlan County, USA\u201d doc about a miner\u2019s strike, but this was to be a film mostly about music. They stayed aboard to record one of the most revealing episodes in the history of country music, and \u201cShut Up and Sing\u201d (2006) tells the story of how the Dixie Chicks and their manager dealt with the rage of some (not all) of their fans.  Political dissent has an honorable history in country music, just as freedom of speech is the bedrock of our American freedoms, but tell that to the people threatening boycotts of country stations or issuing anonymous death threats against the Dixie Chicks. They\u2019re for freedom of speech as long as they agree with what\u2019s being said. But listen to Johnny Cash defending the blacklisted Pete Seeger as \u201cthe best patriot I know.\u201d Or consider these lyrics by John Prine, the best songwriter in modern country history: Your flag decal won\u2019t get you into heaven anymore;\r It\u2019s already overcrowded by their dirty little war;\r And Jesus don\u2019t like killin\u2019, no matter what the reason for\u2026   Or the heartbreak of the great Prine song beginning:  Sam Stone, came home, from the conflict overseas,\r With a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back\u2026  Of course Prine\u2019s songs were about Vietnam, a war that impacted differently because of the draft. Iraq is being fought largely by an volunteer Army, if you can call being a National Guardsmen in your third tour of duty volunteering. And in those earliest days, the Administration was predicting a pacified, peaceful and democratic Iraq in months if not weeks. As Bush\u2019s approval rating has plummeted, the Dixie Chicks have slowly won their way back toward acceptance, and this documentary is a fascinating record of their journey. Advertisement  Kopple and Peck seem to have free access to the Chicks, backstage and behind closed doors, and we hear them in frank discussions with their manager, Simon Renshaw, about the devastation of their careers. At first, a stunned Maines tries to rationalize: She was just kidding, it was a throwaway line, she supports our troops but not the President\u2019s invasion. It becomes clear that Chicks fans are not big on nuance, and have a zero tolerance for dissent.  Or do they? Were the nation\u2019s country stations gutless in caving in to the threats of boycott? Was there not one with the courage to play the most popular country group in the land? On their first American tour after the debacle, the Chicks sell out every arena, are cheered in standing ovations, and are embraced in Greenville, S.C. on the very day of \u201cMission Accomplished.\u201d At one concert, Maines tells the audience it\u2019s OK to boo: \u201cWe believe in freedom of speech. So let\u2019s stop right now for 15 seconds of booing.\u201d All she hears are cheers.  The documentary shows what a tight-knit group the Chicks are. Banjo player Emily Robison and fiddler Martie Maguire, sisters who brought in Maines as lead singer, had no idea what Maine was going to say that day in London, but they stand behind her without question. There\u2019s no complaining, just shellshock.  During the course of 2003-2006, Robison and Maguire have babies (Emily has twins) after agonizing fertility procedures. They write and record \u201cTaking the Long Way,\u201d a new album in which, far from apologizing, Maines sings \u201cNot Ready to Make Nice.\u201d It is some of their best work, freeing them from the confines of country, but the album doesn\u2019t sell like their earlier work. Discussing lagging CD and concert sales, they decide to be honest about it. It becomes clear that their careers are less important to them than, for want of a better word, their sisterhood.  The documentary shows an ugly side of the right wing intimidation they face. Among all of the self-anointed patriots who picket them, there is apparently not a glimmer of a notion of what freedom of speech means. Their opponents live in an Orwellian world in which others are granted only the freedom to agree. Heard in sound bites, seen with hate slogans on signs and t-shirts, they are not a pretty picture. \tAnd there are the chilling backstage preparations for a Dallas concert before which they have received a death threat. To be willing to stand unprotected in front of thousands of people and sing your songs despite such a threat takes courage, and it is a brave defense of American values, although their critics cannot see it that way. \u201cShut Up and Sing\u201d tells the story of three young women whose belief in America is bred in the bone, and it shames their critics. \tAs for Natalie Maines\u2019 timing, maybe she simply made the mistake of being premature. The country music demographic group is bearing a disproportionate share of the burden of Iraq, with its National Guardsmen husbands, wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters absent, wounded or dead. They are paying a heavy price for a war started on lies, and are perhaps not as angry these days at Natalie for speaking truthfully. Advertisement"}

This is his third film, after \"Helvetica\" (2007) and \"Objectified\" (2009) to consider the role of design in our daily lives. The first two dealt with details, with the design of the most ubiquitous typeface of the century and with the packaging of consumer objects. \"Urbanized\" is a fast zoom out to the big picture: The colonies or hives in which we arrange, display and support our lives. Advertisement Cities are a mixture of deliberate design, accident, history, geography, and countless small collective decisions by the citizens that impose themselves. For example, it is well known that in parks and public green spaces, people will walk where there should logically be a path, whether one is provided or not. On campus quadrangles, planners give up and pave the way. The doc argues that the most disastrous city planning decisions have been marred by the grandiosity of the planners. From the air, Brasilia, the capitol of Brazil, built from scratch in the jungle, looks like a magnificent grouping of sculptures. But for whose eyes? Aliens?

Robert Moses, the megalomaniac planning czar of New York City, saw organic neighborhoods as an impediment to his vast rebuilding schemes. Venice, by contrast, grew up island by island, structure by structure, in a shallow lagoon, with no coherent planning at all, and today is arguably the most agreeable city on earth, despite its undeniable inconveniences. In an undertaking on an impressive scale, Hustwit and his team travel the earth interviewing architects, city planners, officials, community leaders and (perhaps not enough) ordinary people. He dramatizes how a stretch of abandoned rail tracks in New York was transformed into a green walkway, \"the High Line,\" and how a majority of Copenhagen's residents travel by bicycle. He is silenced by the slums of Mumbai, where there is one toilet seat for very 600 people, but there is this undeniable fact: For all of the misery and health problems of such areas, which are almost beyond fixing, they grew and operate by human decisions, and for the people who live there they have more life and soul than \"projects\" stacking them into cells. Hustwit's heroine is Jane Jacobs, who famously praised mixed-use neighborhoods and \"eyes on the street\" as the heart of city life. What people like to do is stroll down a street where they know people and shops, there is variety and novelty, and things to look at. My own recent obsession has been with the invasion of soulless cookie-cooker branch bank offices, mobile phone stores and other sterile pests that crowd out shops, restaurants, and ordinary human activities. As architects draw, so men live. A New York writer observes happily that \"Urbanized\" closes on a shot of the magnificent Manhattan skyline. Yes, but there is nowhere in Manhattan where you can stand to see it. I recommend that he admire the Chicago skyline after walking out to the end of Navy Pier, or taking a stroll along 36 miles of our beach paths. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Club", "Review": "Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cThe Club\u201d introduces its characters in opening scenes that highlights their daily activities. Though the first is a long shot of a man playing with his dog on a beach, Larra\u00edn\u2019s camera more often stays close to the distinctly different though equally worn faces of his subjects. It\u2019s a motif he will carry throughout the film, and this level of intimacy is used not for character empathy, but to disturb the viewer. The members of \u201cThe Club\u201d represent an institutional evil from which most people would recoil, yet the viewer is purposely kept too close for comfort. These are men whom we\u2019ll discover are not sorry for their heinous crimes, and the mere insinuation of their apathy is enough to enrage. But horror ultimately gives way to irritation as the film veers into violent shock tactics and misplaced blame. What begins as a righteous indictment devolves into an unnecessary vendetta. Advertisement The first act of \u201cThe Club\u201d is a tightly wound series of coy revelations that end in an effective, shocking act of violence. A beachside house in La Boca, Chile, is a \u201cretreat for priests\u201d who have been sent there for reasons easy to predict. The men are overseen by their \u201cjailer,\" a nun named Sister M\u00f3nica (Antonia Zegers) whose unflappable calmness is a blatant warning sign that she\u2019s trying too hard to seem innocuous. The defrocked priests include the dog owner, Padre Vidal (Alfredo Castro), Padre Ramirez (Alejandro Sieveking) and Padre Silva (Jaime Vadell). They seem content with their days of \u201cprayer and a little recreation,\u201d the latter of which includes chronic boozing and gambling on Padre Vidal\u2019s talented greyhound in the local dog races. Into this closed system comes another priest, Padre Lazcano (Jos\u00e9 Soza), whose arrival reveals the reasons the priests have been exiled and isolated. A local fisherman named\u00a0Sandokan (Roberto Far\u00edas) arrives outside the compound to call on Padre Lazcano. Sandokan proceeds to describe, in pornographic detail, his childhood sexual abuse when he was an altar boy of Padre Lazcano. I\u2019m not sure if Sandokan\u2019s words are some kind of personal exorcism or a subversive attempt to torture the priests by turning them on; Sandokan speaks in this explicit sexual way to the priests for most of the film, and at one point, offers to have sex with them before offering to find them young boys to molest. Regardless, his introductory monologue seems endless. Sandokan\u2019s speech unnerves the priests so much that one of them sends Padre Lazcano outside with a gun to \u201cscare Sandokan away.\u201d Father Matias steps outside and promptly blows his own brains out. The next priest to arrive at the house is not so easily rattled. He\u2019s Padre Garc\u00eda (Marcelo Alonso), a Jesuit priest \u00a0and psychologist. Garc\u00eda has been sent by the Vatican, presumably to close the house down because of Padre Lazcano's death. It is implied that his visit was planned before Padre Lazcano's arrival, so his appearance and actions carry a hint of mystery. Is he there to investigate the suicide, psychoanalyze the men, play avenging angel or further enforce the Church\u2019s cover-ups? Garc\u00eda interrogates each priest, all of whom to a fault are unwilling to confess or even consider their crimes against the children in their care. His conversations give the viewer ample opportunity to hate these men, all of whom never once appear to be anything but easy symbols. One priest kidnapped poor children and gave them to rich families, for example. Even Sister\u00a0M\u00f3nica has skeletons in her closet, though the film\u2019s choice to make her the most villainous, sadistic character is one of its bigger mistakes. Eventually, corruption spreads like wildfire and everyone in close proximity runs the risk of bursting into flames.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cThe Club\u201d dilutes its potentially powerful message by introducing a confusing, dangerous correlation between homosexuality and pedophilia. It starts with homosexual Padre Vidal\u2019s interrogation by Garc\u00eda and reaches a rather vile nadir with a scene between Sandokan and a naked hooker who violates him anally at his request before recoiling in disgust. Sandokan is so poorly written that any sexual confusion he has manifests itself as self-hating homosexuality rather than uncertainty. The ultimate fate of the character further supports this interpretation, though I question if this was Larra\u00edn\u2019s intention. Larra\u00edn is excellent at creating worlds in microcosm and examining them (his \u201cNo\u201d was one of 2012\u2019s best films). His IMDb article says he is \u201dnot for the weak-hearted, his films are straightforward, generally aggressive and interspersed with violence.\u201d\u00a0This is certainly true of \u201cThe Club,\" but as with \u201cTony Manero,\" his most well-known film, there\u2019s a \u201cbeating a dead horse\u201d kind of feeling to some of that aggression. We get the point long before the unnecessary details designed to drag us irrevocably to the director\u2019s side. At least with \u201cTony Manero,\u201d Larra\u00edn\u2019s characters felt fleshed out. Had he really wanted to scare us in \u201cThe Club,\" he would have made at least one priest achingly human and three-dimensional despite his terrible crimes, then forced us to stare at that repentant guy as an indicator of a much more corrupt system of evil."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Goodbye to Language", "Review": "Yes, but what is Godard trying to say? This is the question, the question, the question critics ask, and have asked, since Jean Luc-Godard made his first feature, \"Breathless,\" back in 1959. And with his latest, \"Goodbye to Language,\" they're asking it again.\u00a0 What is it? Where to begin? Much of the film is built around a young couple at a lake house who do a lot of arguing and also spend a lot of time naked. (Much of this feels like a self-parody of European art cinema tendencies: How can I get people to sit still for an extended discussion of politics and language? By having attractive people take their clothes off, of course.)\u00a0But these characters one just anchor points for, essentially, a feature length montage, much of it quickly edited, with few shots held longer than three or four seconds. The style might be irritating in a traditional narrative film. But it seems of a piece in a movie that is partly about (Godard's films are always \"about\" more than one thing\u2014and often only partly about any of them) the impossibility of focusing, concentrating,\u00a0and\u00a0comprehending history, and politics, and the written and spoken word, then making all of it make some kind of sense, if only to yourself. If Terrence Malick tried to make a Godard film in the spirit of Godard, it might look something like this, though with less prolonged discussion of Hitler, the Holocaust, colonialism, imperialism and other favorite Godard subjects, but with Godard's cryptic voice-over aphorisms (\"This morning is a dream. Each person must think that the other is the dreamer\").\u00a0 Advertisement Did I mention it's in 3-D? It's in 3-D. And Godard's use of 3-D is the most original since Werner Herzog's \"The Cave of Forgotten Dreams.\" Herzog's brilliance was counterintuitive (at least from a commercial standpoint). He put a technical process that's often deployed in service of spectacle and violence and instead used it in the most mundane (and therefore revelatory) manner: to give an added sense of presence, of \"you are there-ness,\" to very long takes, of a camera gliding through plant life (a snake's-eye view) or an unseen viewer (us) scrutinizing an ancient mural, or listening to an expert tell us about that mural while shifting nervously from foot to foot.\u00a0 Godard deploys the technology in a cheeky way (of course he does; he's Godard!).\u00a0Here, 3-D becomes one more element in Godard's career-long fascination\u00a0with\u00a0exploring cinema's formal properties, its grammar and technique and technology\u2014the better to show how films can\u00a0tell or elide a story, reveal or obfuscate the truth, or just kill screen time by distracting us with pretty pictures or jokes.\u00a0There are a lot of pretty pictures in this movie, and a lot of jokes, and they're not all corrosive or politically minded. Sometimes Godard seems to just be doing them because he wants to do them\u2014because he wants to try something new, or different. Other times the film combines pretty pictures and jokes to create an oxymoron: a gorgeous sight gag.\u00a0 The film often superimposes two titles or subtitles over each other, collage-style, or allows people or objects in the frame to partly obscure written words; at a New York screening of \"Goodbye to Language\" a few weeks back, the first time the film played around with text in this way, you could see a few critics sort of leaning to one side, as if attempting to\u00a0see around whatever was on top of\u00a0the\u00a0thing that they wanted to see. The movie also uses 3-D to create\u00a0something\u00a0like 2 1/2 D, by which I mean, you're aware of separate planes within the same image, seemingly separated by\u00a0indeterminate\u00a0space, yet each plane is two-dimensional, which means the net effect is like looking\u00a0through\u00a0a series of scrims, each\u00a0emblazoned\u00a0with a silkscreened image. (Godard has contributed episodes to two 3-D anthology films, \"The Three Disasters\"\u00a0and \"The Bridges of Sarajevo.\" Clearly this format is not just a lark to him.) Advertisement Shooting in digital video again, the 83-year old director plays with color saturation, exposure, light and shadow.\u00a0In shots taken through the windshield of a car zipping down a highway at night, the blacks have been crushed so that you can't see any background detail; red taillights in the\u00a0background\u00a0become\u00a0splashes of red. In a shot of roses in a green field, the red of the flowers has\u00a0been\u00a0cranked up so that the color smears and seems to be trying to escape the petals, like spirits escaping a body. An intriguingly Malick-ian point-of-view shot looking up at trees festooned\u00a0with\u00a0fall leaves favors two colors: orange for the leaves and violet for the sky. And of course there are lots and lots and lots of shots of dogs. Godard loves dogs. Meanwhile the film's multiple\u00a0narrators\u00a0go full-steam ahead, peppering the soundtrack with thoughts and fragments of thoughts, some of them overlapping. Some music cues are cut off abruptly, as if somebody had pressed the \"Stop\" button on a recording. We hear that cinema is the enemy and\u00a0savior of memory, that the state is at war with its people. The camera lingers over a shot of a sink superimposed over a shot of bisected oranges and lemons superimposed over a red substance (blood) slowly spreading through water.\u00a0 The film continually circles back to its rhetorical center\u2014the idea that existence is about trying to reconcile the \"real\" world with the subjective experience of the world, and the names and notions we use to catalog and define the world\u2014but the digressions are what make it sing, or scat-sing. \"I will barely say a word,\" says a voice on the soundtrack\u2014maybe Godard?\u2014adding, \"I am looking for poverty in language.\" Given that the film is itself so richly expressive in every sort of language (written, spoken, visual) this seems like yet another wonderful joke, one that somehow doubles as a lament.\u00a0\"Goodbye to Language\" will be catnip to anyone who continues to appreciate Godard and find him fascinating, and toxic to anyone who read this review and thought, \"No thanks.\" It's a rapturous experience, mostly, though tempered by a certain Godardian crankiness.\u00a0Watching it is, I would imagine, as close as we'll get to being able to be Godard, sitting there thinking, or dreaming. It's a documentary of a restless mind.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Wonders", "Review": "\"The Wonders,\" about a family of rural Tuscan beekeepers dragged toward a modern urban mentality, is a throwback to different kind of filmmaking: smaller, more emotionally intense, more tactile. It's also a film in which not much \"happens\" in the sense that hack screenwriting books keep advising.  The family is a recent arrival to the region. They are in retreat from modernity, rather ostentatiously so. If the film were set in the 1970s they could be part of an American hippie commune that turned its back on The Man and went off into the woods to get back in touch with the Mother Goddess Nature. The father is a gangly, balding, brusque German named Wolfgang (Sam Louwyck) who is quick to raise his voice and always seems beleaguered. The mother Angelica (Alba Rohrwacher) is a slender woman with a wary face and a much warmer manner. They have five girls. The eldest shares the name of the heroine of one of Federico Fellini's early masterpieces, \"La Strada\": Gelosomina (Maria Alexandra Lungu). Everything is status-quo and hunky-dory until one day when it isn't. While letting off steam after a long morning of tending their bees, the family goes bathing in nearby waters. A well-dressed young man emerges from the woods and asks them to please be quiet. They follow him and find out why: they're shooting a promo for an unscripted TV show searching for the \"Most Traditional Family.\u201d  Advertisement The show is hosted by an already gorgeous woman named Milly Catena who's made more gorgeous by her flowing white costume, sort of a science fiction upgrade of a saint's robes. In one of the film's many instances of perfect casting, Milly is played by Monica Bellucci. Her appearance transfixes the girls. They stare up at her as if she were in fact a religious apparition, and after that moment Gelsomina is obsessed by the idea of being on the show. The father, the most staunchly traditional member of this ostentatiously traditional family, is against it. But the government has just ordered that honey collectors standardize practices in the area and they don't have the money to do this, so dad's stubbornness prompts some rancor in the family and sets up the next phase of the story, in which the family tries to pick up some extra money by accepting a juvenile delinquent foster kid named Martin (Luis Huilca Logrono) into their house. This section takes too long to play out but is fascinating nonetheless, for the impending sexual awakening it heralds among the girls (Martin has that faintly predatory but objectively blank look that some handsome middle school boys have) and for the tensions it lays bare between the parents of girls. Much of the time when you watch \"The Wonder\" you're just watching people talk or go on about their daily business. The movie is written and directed by Alice Rohrwacher, whose 2011 debut \"Corpus\" established her bona fides telling rough yet beautiful stories about real-seeming people. This new movie feels like a continuation of that tradition and also a refinement of her technique. It's shot on Super 16mm film, often in rather long, handheld takes\u2014a throwback way of filming a movie about a family living an increasingly antiquated way of life. Most of the acting feels not like acting, but behavior. It's not trying to seem documentary-like, but there are moments where, if you were just stumbling onto \"The Wonders\" on TV, you'd be fooled.  It wouldn't be correct to say the film has no story; it does. There is forward emotional momentum, it's just not big on traditional plot. But because the progression of incidents is rather lumpy and doesn't have a cause-and-effect that feels intuitively apparent, there are sections where the film drags, and you think, \"Why are we still here? We know where things have to go\u2014can't we just go there?\" Still, there's something refreshing, at times remarkable, about the sureness of the acting, and the filmmaker's touch. The movie has turned its back on modernity. It seems to want to be a Belgian art house drama from fifteen years ago, or a documentary from about 1971, when moviemakers just found unusual people and situations and pointed their cameras at them and then reported back.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Nut Job", "Review": "To offset the arrival of \"The Nut Job\", an underwhelming 3-D animated adventure, let us take a moment to praise the \"Ice Age\" franchise and its acorn-addict star attraction that is a likely inspiration for this strained exercise in fur-bearing tomfoolery: Scrat, that sublime creature of Sisyphean single-mindedness.  He covets his nut. He worships his nut. He puts his life on the line again and again to save his nut as it repeatedly rolls just out of reach. His actions speak so loud\u2014along with his manic screeching\u2014he doesn't even have to utter a word to connect with the audience. As a result of a simple yet durable premise and an abundance of animal magnetism, this saber-tooth squirrel-rat has risen to the recognizable ranks of such cartoon icons as Wile E. Coyote and Mickey Mouse.  Advertisement Too bad that the makers of \"The Nut Job\" eagerly purloined Scrat's primal motivation\u2014food\u2014but failed to note the charm of his minimalist approach. Instead, the main character in this Canadian-South Korean-American production is Surly, a selfish purple squirrel (voiced with off-putting abrasiveness by Will Arnett), who quickly becomes mired in a heist-driven plot that defies logic and hardly goes anywhere. Surly, who refuses to be a team player by helping out his fellow park-dwelling critters as they forage for sustenance before winter comes (\"I'm no hero,\" he proudly proclaims), is involved in accidentally destroying what little they have stockpiled inside a massive oak tree. Raccoon, the seemingly avuncular leader of the urban woodland community who speaks with the sonorous tones of Liam Neeson, clearly has pawed through a copy of \"Animal Farm\"; he banishes handy scapegoat Surly and forces him to fend for himself in the streets of the bustling town while solidifying his own status. It doesn't take long before the squirrel and his silent sidekick, Buddy the rat (who could be Ratatouille's meeker cousin), discover Maury's Nut Shop, which is chock full of tempting treats. The store proves to be a front for a motley crew of not-very-bright '30s-style gangsters who look as if they stepped out of an old Looney Tunes short.   The mugs want to rob the bank across the street. Surly and Buddy, soon joined by other rodent conspirators including chubby woodchucks, a mole and a common-sensical she-squirrel named Andie (Katherine Heigl, so vocally bland as to be unrecognizable), want to plunder the shop's basement storage area\u2014or, as Surly calls it, \"the lost city of Nutlantis.\" Each scheme involves making a tunnel, missions that are so easily accomplished that you barely notice they happen. Double-crosses and car chases duly follow while supposedly funny distractions are peppered into throughout the muddled storyline. Fart jokes that fall flat. A variety of nut puns with no purpose. Gags built upon ancient stereotypes\u2014cops like doughnuts, who knew? Most wrong-headed is the introduction of unnecessary gunplay into the proceedings. If you aren't doing a remake of \"Bambi\", firearms usually aren't the way to go these days when making family entertainment.\u00a0And, of course, Surly becomes an unlikely hero. Advertisement The lone character that moviegoers might cotton to is Precious, a pug in the spirit of \"Up\"'s Dug that is lucky enough to have the voice of a very able Maya Rudolph. The bug-eyed pooch quickly drops her watchdog act at the store for the promise of being able to lick Surly's face.  It's not that the main talents behind \"The Nut Job\" don't know better. Director Peter Lepeniotis has worked as an animator at Disney and Pixar and his co-writer, Lorne Cameron, helped pen DreamWorks' similar \"Over the Hedge\" as well as Disney's \"Brother Bear\". While the film isn't the worst of its kind, it might be one of the dullest of recent vintage."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Jurassic Park 3D", "Review": "Back in 1993, what was astonishing in \"Jurassic Park\" were the special effects that seemed to bring dinosaurs back to life. Two decades later, rediscovering Steven Spielberg's mastery of cinematic storytelling is the best reason to go see it again. It is back in theaters with the best 3-D conversion I've seen, avoiding the cheesy Viewmaster effect too often the result of retrofitted 3-D. Other than a few shots where the foreground is blurred, the effects are immersive and organic, and the dinosaurs-jumping-toward-you moments are sparing and effective. Advertisement My favorite moment has always been when the characters in a Jeep are trying to outrace the charging T-rex. All of a sudden, we see a toothy dinosaur coming at them fast and angry in the side-view mirror. It takes a moment for the words to register: \"Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.\" Spielberg has found a way to make us laugh and ramp up the tension. And it is even more compelling in 3-D. The film holds up remarkably well, other than the computers and walkie-talkies, which will seem to today's audiences almost as prehistoric as the paleolithic creatures. But its then-state-of-the-art special effects, a combination of mechanical creations and computer images, are still as believable as the high-techiest creatures onscreen today.  Spielberg has gone on to weightier and more prestigious projects, but this thrill ride is one of his best and a masterpiece of the genre. It shows his unparalleled gifts for pacing and for the visual language of movies, and his ability to make us invest in the characters. That is what makes all the special effects pack an emotional wallop. He conveys more with ripples in a glass of water than most filmmakers can with 15 pages of dialogue. The story, based on a book by the late Michael Crichton, begins with hubris, the sin of pride so great that a man places himself with the gods and thus sets the stage for his downfall. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) dreams of extracting dino and plant DNA that has been trapped in amber and using it to reboot prehistoric species of flora and fauna. Spielberg grounds the story with a moral core that lets us enjoy the catastrophic destruction without any inconvenient pangs of conscience. Spielberg also makes sure we have someone to root for, lining up our loyalties with characters we can both identify with and admire. Laura Dern and Sam Neill play experts in paleolithic animals and plants who are (1) interested in science, not money and (2) in love. That's all we need to know. But just to make sure, he adds in a few children, who not only get our protective instincts going but give Neill's character a chance to grow. Go to see \"Jurassic Park\" in 3-D. Go to take your kids who were not born when it was released. Go to see it the way it should be seen, on a big screen in a theater filled with happily terrified fans. Go to see Samuel L. Jackson before he was Samuel L. Jackson But most of all, go for the delight of watching pure Spielberg movie magic. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Homesman", "Review": "The journey in Tommy Lee Jones' \"The Homesman\", based on the 1988 novel \r\nby Glendon Swarthout, travels from west to east, from the unmarked \r\nNebraska territory to a town in Iowa. It is a reverse trajectory of the \r\ntypical Western path, the wildness of the prairies and plains reverting,\r\n startlingly, to a tame village perched on the edge of the placid \r\nMissouri River. When civilization finally arrives in the final section \r\nof the film, it seems palpably fragile; what has come before is so \r\nunremittingly desolate.  Advertisement \"The Homesman,\" despite the title, is about \r\nwomen. Women are the center of the action, women drive the action \r\nforward, women are not only damsels in distress but heroic figures of \r\ngrit and courage (sometimes in the same moment). The men are helpless \r\nbystanders or ambiguous allies. There is only one villain in the film, \r\nand he is a villain because he is callous. He lacks empathy. Tommy Lee \r\nJones, as a director, homes in on the surreal aspects of the story with \r\nbeautiful sensitivity and strangeness (\"The Homesman\" is an extremely \r\nstrange film), highlighting the monotony of the landscape in which \r\nfigures are either dwarfed by the vastness of it or tower above the flat\r\n horizon. The West, as seen in \"The Homesman,\" is an unforgiving place, \r\nwith flashes of stark and nightmarish beauty. Three women have lost \r\ntheir minds in \"The Homesman,\" but honestly, everyone you meet in the \r\nfilm is slightly crazy, the homesman most of all. Nobody is a pillar of \r\nmental health. Sanity, then, could be seen as overrated, especially in a\r\n world like the one in \"The Homesman.\" And those who lose their minds \r\nmay very well be the only realists in the story. These are deeply \r\nsuggestive ideas, and when \"The Homesman\" works best it teeters around \r\nin that morally ambiguous territory. It's a risky film. Sometimes the \r\nrisks pay off, sometimes they don't, but the feeling of risk infuses the\r\n film with chaos, humor, violence, beauty. \"The Homesman\" doesn't play \r\nthings safe, and that's a welcome change. \r\nMary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) is a middle-aged woman, born in upstate \r\nNew York, who has bought land in the Nebraska territory. She is \r\nunmarried and farms the land herself. She yearns to buy a piano and \r\ncomforts herself by playing hymns on a cloth keyboard. She is seen early\r\n on proposing marriage to a farmer who owns land adjacent to hers. She \r\npitches it as a business proposition, although there is an urgent need \r\nand fragility beneath her words that tell a different story. He turns \r\nher down pretty bluntly: \"You're too bossy and you're too damn plain.\" \r\nIt hurts, it hurts bad, but Mary Bee does not pity herself. She has too \r\nmuch work to do. \r\nDuring the tail-end of a particularly terrible winter, three women in \r\nthe area descend into varying degrees of psychosis, dissociation, \r\nself-harm, and derangement. It is clear that they need to be transported\r\n to a place that can treat them, and the minister (John Lithgow) has a \r\nconnection with a church in Iowa that has agreed to take them in. When \r\nthe menfolk in the congregation balk at the job of transport, Mary Bee \r\ntakes it on. A glorified paddy wagon is provided, complete with iron \r\nrings on the interior in order to chain the women in place, should it be\r\n necessary. The journey will be dangerous and long, and Mary Bee needs to\r\n hire a homesman, and George Briggs, a drunken out-for-himself \r\nclaim-jumper, is just the man for the job. Mary Bee pitches it to him \r\nwith the same matter-of-fact tone that she proposed marriage, telling \r\nhim exactly what she needs and expects, and exactly what she will not \r\ntolerate. He's a bit of a buffoon, in his filthy long-johns and whining \r\nvoice, but he needs the money. Advertisement \r\nThe early introduction of the three madwomen is presented hauntingly by \r\nJones. The images flash onto the screen, interrupting the main action of\r\n Mary Bee at her farm, and Jones crafts a collage of terror and \r\ndread. Gro Svendsen (Sonja Richter) is a Scandinavian woman, seen \r\nscreaming in agony as her husband drags her dead mother out into the \r\nsnowy night: the corpse is stinking, she can't stay in the house \r\nanymore. Arabella (Grace Gummer) is a teenager, with a young husband, \r\nand her three babies died in a matter of days from diphtheria. She has \r\ngone comatose, staring out the window, clutching a rag doll. Theoline \r\n(Miranda Otto) is shown strolling outside into a biting snowstorm, a \r\nwailing purple newborn nipping at her bare breast, and she casually \r\ntosses the baby down the hole in the outhouse; the most harrowing image \r\nin the film. The presentation of madness is both compassionate and \r\nunblinking. \r\nBriggs is a comic figure in the beginning, a drawling and \r\ninappropriately insouciant Walter Brennan-type character, garrulous and \r\ncareless, demanding Mary Bee buy him a jug of whiskey for the ride. The \r\ndynamic between Briggs and pious straight-talking spinster is one of the\r\n pleasures of the film. It almost becomes a classic buddy picture. Both \r\ncharacters are outlaws. Neither of them fit into \"normal\" society. Both \r\nof them are individualists, who value strength, who have strength, but \r\nwho will always be just a little bit on the periphery of accepted norms.\r\n This could be seen as a tragedy for them; it could be seen as a \r\ntriumph. The film does not come down on either side. The situation is \r\nnot \"either/or\". It is \"both/and.\" \r\nThere are confrontations with the elements during the journey; there are\r\n moments when they lose control of the women. One breaks free; one \r\nkicks the other in the face; one is unable or unwilling to handle her own\r\n bodily functions as Briggs lifts her skirt up for her and barks, \"Squat now. Come on. Pee.\" At first wary with one another, and at \r\nsome moments damn near confrontational, Briggs and Mary Bee find that \r\nthey are good partners, tag-teaming the job, and talking at night over \r\nthe crackling fire as the three women lie tied up to the wagon wheels, \r\nasleep or in a daze. Advertisement \r\nFor most of the film, it is Mary Bee's story. She is its anchor, and \r\nBriggs is her sidekick. Something happens three-fourths of the way through that \r\nputs Briggs in the center, as the title character. Having not read the \r\nnovel, the moment came as an enormous surprise, almost shattering the \r\nfabric of the film, as harrowing, in its way, of the vision of the \r\nmother throwing her baby into the privy hole. In thinking back on it, \r\nthere are fragments of behavior shown, glimpses of inner life, that \r\nmakes that moment inevitable, in retrospect. The film expands \r\nexponentially as the formal narrative is destabilized, and things get \r\ndistinctly stranger, although Jones keeps his eye on the overall theme \r\nof madness and survival; trauma and strength. \r\nThe strangest section of the film involves a stop-over at the Fairfield \r\nHotel, standing alone in the middle of the plains, like an Andrew Wyeth \r\npainting, reminiscent of Sam Shepard's house in Terrence \r\nMalick's \"Days of Heaven.\" The smooth-talking Irishman proprietor (James Spader) hopes to \r\nattract investors to this little spot in the middle of nowhere, \r\nsurrounded by sheer emptiness.  So he's a little nuts, too. Beautifully conceived and \r\nshot, the section is a tangent, but it is extremely revealing about \r\nBriggs' character, as well as a sardonic, pointed commentary about the \r\nconcept of civilization. Civilization, as represented by the small \r\nhuddle of farms out in Nebraska, does its best to help those who need \r\nit. Civilization, as represented by the tiny town in Iowa, is kind and \r\ngenteel, although it doesn't quite know what to do with a man like \r\nBriggs. Elsewhere, though, like at the totally empty Fairfield Hotel, \r\nwith its sideboard heaped with luscious food, and its paintings of naked\r\n women in the lobby, civilization is cold and unfeeling. There is an \r\nargument to be made that the only place where someone like Briggs, or \r\nsomeone like Mary Bee, could ever hope to \"fit in\" is out there in the \r\nunmarked territories, cutting their way into the land, relying only on \r\nthemselves, a landscape where eccentricity is an asset. \r\nJones' visual style is simple and clean, and cinematographer Rodrigo \r\nPrieto finds some gorgeous John Ford touches; people shown in black \r\nsilhouette through barn doorways, or house doorways, with the vast \r\nbright landscape beyond, a clear demarcation between interior and \r\nexterior, displaying the individual against the sheer size of the land out there. \r\nThere's a section where Mary Bee gets separated from the wagon and \r\nwanders the plains through the dark night on her horse, disoriented and \r\nlost, calling out for Briggs, resorting to chewing on grass like a feral\r\n creature. These dark sequences have the hallucinatory quality of a \r\nnightmare. Advertisement \r\nNovelist Glendon Swarthout was interested in unlikely characters who \r\nhave to show extraordinary courage and strength. He was interested in \r\nthe moral ambiguities of familiar genres. The best example of this comes\r\n in his most famous book, \"Bless the Beasts and the \r\nChildren\" (which has never gone out of print since it was \r\npublished in 1971). \"Bless the Beasts and the Children\"\r\n tells the story of a group of misfit kids who have been sent to a boys'\r\n home/dude ranch in the American Southwest. Turned into a film in 1972, \r\ndirected by Stanley Kramer, it takes the age-old themes of the Western \r\n(man vs. nature, man vs. the landscape, man vs. himself) and pours it \r\ninto the service of a modern coming-of-age drama. \"The Homesman,\" like \r\n\"Bless the Beasts\" questions the \"norm\". It asks questions about what \r\nstrength looks like (in men and in women), and also what strength might \r\nactually mean, what it signifies. Holding a rifle on an enemy requires \r\nstrength. So does being kind and caring to someone who has descended \r\ninto psychosis. Jones puts all of those elements on a level playing \r\nfield. Women are misfits here because of their biology. Biology could be\r\n seen as an enemy: motherhood is wonderful, but terrible when your \r\ninfant triplets all die on the same day. And what of those, like Mary \r\nBee, who have been denied the \"natural\" outlet for women, through \r\nwifehood and motherhood? What does biology mean then? \r\nThe final section of the film is suddenly conventional, and represents a\r\n confused petering-out of strength, a tame meandering coda to the \r\nchaotic thrust of the story. It's almost like \"The Homesman,\" barreling \r\nalong at a high speed, powerful and weird and funny and terrible, hits \r\nan invisible speed bump all of a sudden, and the pieces fly apart. But \r\nthe conventional coda cannot erase the risk-filled pleasure of all that \r\ncame before."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Wendy and Lucy", "Review": "I know so much about Wendy, although this movie tells me so little. I know almost nothing about where she came from, what her life was like, how realistic she is about the world, where her ambition lies. But I know, or feel, everything about Wendy at this moment: stranded in an Oregon town, broke, her dog lost, her car a write-off, hungry, friendless, quiet, filled with desperate resolve. Kelly Reichardt's \"Wendy and Lucy\" is another illustration of how absorbing a film can be when the plot doesn't stand between us and a character. There is no timetable here. Nowhere Wendy came from, nowhere she's going to, no plan except to get her car fixed and feed her dog. Played by Michelle Williams, she has a gaze focused inward, on her determination. We pick up a few scraps: Her sister in Indiana is wary of her, and she thinks she might be able to find a job in a fish cannery in Ketchikan, Alaska. Advertisement But Alaska seems a long way to drive from Indiana just to get a job in a cannery, and this movie isn't about the unemployment rate. Alaska perhaps appeals to Wendy because it is as far away she can drive where they still speak English. She parks on side streets and sleeps in her car, she has very limited cash, her golden retriever Lucy is her loving companion. She wakes up one morning somewhere in Oregon, her car won't start and she's out of dog food, and that begins a chain of events that leads to wandering around a place she doesn't know for her only friend in the world. When I say I know all about Wendy, that's a tribute to Michelle Williams' acting, Kelly Reichardt's direction and the cinematography of Sam Levy. They use Williams' expressive face, often forlorn, always hopeful, to show someone who embarked on an unplanned journey, has gone too far to turn back. And right now, she doesn't care about anything but getting her friend back. Her world is seen as the flat everyday world of shopping malls and storefronts, rail tracks and not much traffic, skies that the weatherman calls \"overcast.\" You know those days when you walk around, and the weather makes you feel in your stomach that something is not right? Cinematography can make you feel like that. She walks. She walks all the way to the dog pound and back. All the way to an auto shop and back. And back to what? She sleeps in a park. The movie isn't about people molesting her, although she has one unpleasant encounter. Most people are nice, like a mechanic (Will Patton), and especially a security guard of retirement age (Wally Dalton) whose job is to stand and look at a mostly empty parking lot for 12 hours and guard against a nonexistent threat to its empty spaces. Early in the film, the teenage supermarket employee (John Robinson) who busts Wendy for shoplifting won't give her a break. He's a little suckup who possibly wants to impress his boss with an unbending adherence to \"store policy.\" Store policy also probably denies him health benefits and overtime, and if he takes a good look at Wendy, he may be seeing himself, minus the uniform with the logo and the nametag on it. The people in the film haven't dropped out of life; they've been dropped by life. It has no real use for them, and not much interest. They're on hold. At least searching for your lost dog is a consuming passion; it gives Wendy a purpose and the hope of joy at the end. That's what this movie has to observe, and it's more than enough.

{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Party", "Review": "Sally Potter is a filmmaker who deserves to be more decisively seen and heard. I\u2019m not one for avidly going to bat for socially-purposeful art, but I dare say that Potter, whose films have long addressed gender identity, political commitment, feminism, capitalism, and other concerns is absolutely, in the parlance of the times, one of the Filmmakers We Need Now. And so here she is, with a new and very powerful film, one which begins with a rage-filled Kristen Scott-Thomas opening, from the inside, a house\u2019s front door (with an ornate brass lion\u2019s head knocker) and pointing a gun at the camera, which is, we infer, adopting a guest\u2019s-eye view.    Advertisement Some party! The credits proceed with gentle accompaniment of a guitar (played by the great musician Fred Frith, a frequent Potter collaborator) striking the uplifting tones of the William Blake hymn \u201cJerusalem\u201d which extols a particular ideal for \u201cEngland\u2019s green and pleasant land.\u201d Scott-Thomas\u2019 character, Janet, is a progressive idealist turned successful politician, and the title party, a small affair, is meant to celebrate her promotion in the British government. Her partner, Bill (Timothy Spall) sits in the living room and spins immaculate vinyl on an immaculate sound system while Janet, still relegated to conventional female host roles cooks\u2014and fends off texts from a romantic admirer who is obviously not Bill. The first arrivals are April (Patricia Clarkson) and her boyfriend Gottfried (Bruno Ganz), an aroma therapist (he calls himself a \u201chealer\u201d) from whom, she almost immediately announces, she is separating. Bill offers Gottfried some wine, and Gottfried cheerfully says, \u201cActually I\u2019m not drinking alcohol at the moment.\u201d Upon hearing this, poor Bill looks as if Gottfried had just murdered his best friend. Gottfried takes it as a joke when Bill says, \u201cI\u2019m Bill, or at least I used to be,\u201d but we will discover that he\u2019s not kidding.    Clarkson\u2019s April is the real pistol of the group, so to speak. \u201cI expect the worst of everyone in the name of reason,\u201d she pronounces at one point. She expresses snide disapproval of the incoming guests. There\u2019s Martha (Cherry Jones), whose partner, Jenny (Emily Mortimer) soon follows to inform her that they are expecting. And not one kid, but triplets. Arriving soon after is Cillian Murphy\u2019s Tom, one half of a seemingly universally admired power couple, the female half of which is mysteriously missing. Speaking of pistols, Tom is carrying a real one, and regularly snorting up powders in the bathroom, the better to psych himself into using it, one supposes, but the only thing it really does is make him sweat a lot. As sarcastic bon mots are traded, political observations made, and personal revelations dropped, whatever is in the kitchen\u2019s oven begins to burn, escalating tensions.    This is a beautifully conceived and executed chamber comedy/drama with tragedy at its core. Potter\u2019s characters are committed to a better world even as they make their own modes of living completely dysfunctional. The convoluted relationship knots that bind these characters are in some respects hangovers from the counterculture, but Potter isn\u2019t doing anything so facile as renouncing the counterculture\u2019s politics. Instead, \u201cThe Party\u201d is a fierce, trenchant look at how prevailing social mores coopt political commitment when we\u2019re not even looking. And once Bill tells why he \u201cused to be,\u201d the movie\u2019s debates and squabbles move into territories of existential dread.    As serious as things get, \u201cThe Party\u201d never stops being funny, sometimes terribly so. \u201cI believe in truth and reconciliation. Truth and reconciliation\u201d says a broken-down Janet near the end, right before biting into her own wrist. Shot in a velvety widescreen black-and-white, performed with utmost commitment by its unimpeachable cast, it\u2019s by my lights the first must-see movie of 2018.\u00a0  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Rabbit Hole", "Review": "In \"Rabbit Hole,\" Becca and Howie are trying their best to get on with things. This is the tricky and very observant story of how a married couple is getting along, eight months after their 4-year-old ran out into the street and was struck dead by a car. They were leveled with grief. Their sex life stopped. They lived for a time in a daze, still surrounded in the house by the possessions of the child who no longer lives there. But their lives are no longer a daily agony. Life is beginning again. \"Rabbit Hole,\" based on an acclaimed play by David Lindsay-Abaire, occupies the drafty spaces between the cliches of this situation. Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) are rattling unhappily in an emotional emptiness. As a couple, they attend a group therapy session for mourners, and Becca finds it's a room full of self-righteous therapy addicts, while Howie finds a sympathetic ear in Gaby (Sandra Oh). And that's just what he finds \u2015 an ear. He finds someone who can hear him, and he feels he must have been speaking past Becca. Advertisement She is also not hearing her mother (Dianne Wiest) or a younger sister (Tammy Blanchard). She's not even on good terms with the dog. Sadness for her has settled into discontent. As a couple, they've reached that point of touchiness where nothing ever seems to be the right thing to say. What makes John Cameron Mitchell's film so interesting is that it bravely investigates what you say then. I know all this sounds like a mournful dirge, but in fact, \"Rabbit Hole\" is entertaining and surprisingly amusing, under the circumstances. The film is in a better state of mind than its characters. Its humor comes, as the best humor does, from an acute observation of human nature. We have known people something like this. We smile in recognition. I was interested in Nicole Kidman's performance. I've always believed her to be talented, since all those years ago when she and Thandie Newton starred in the wonderful \"Flirting\" (1991). She seems to be two people: the glamorous star of \"Moulin Rouge\" and \"Nine,\" and the risky, daring actress in \"Birth,\" \"The Hours\" and \"Eyes Wide Shut.\" Celebrity has clouded her image; if she were less glamorous, she would be more praised. Age will only be an asset to her. Here she plays the character who changes; she's the balance point of the story. Howie has things that happen in his life, but he essentially remains the same man. Becca is troubled and disturbed beyond the depths created eight months ago, and \"Rabbit Hole\" is about how she's pulled by inner tides. The wonder is that Mitchell and David Lindsay-Abaire's screenplay see her confusion fairly clearly. Apart from anything else, \"Rabbit Hole\" is a technical challenge. It is simple enough to cover the events in the story, not so simple to modulate them for humor and even warmth. I knew what the movie would be about, but I was impressed by how it was about it."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "24 Exposures", "Review": "If you follow American independent film, you know Joe Swanberg's name, if only because it's impossible to escape. According to the Internet Movie Database, \"24 Exposures\" is his eighteenth feature since 2005; he has also directed short films and TV episodes and been a producer, actor and crew-member for other filmmakers. So when we talk about Swanberg, we're talking about a guy who adheres to Woody Allen's philosophy of the artist as pro ballplayer: the goal isn't to hit a home run every time you're at the plate, but to bat as many times as possible and keep your average up. Swanberg's average has improved over time\u2014he's an intelligent and tireless filmmaker, and his recent features \"All the Light in the Sky\" and \"Uncle Kent\" and his segment of \"V/H/S\" were solid and occasionally inspired\u2014but his latest, about a photographer who might be a killer, is wild pop fly that disappears in the stands. Advertisement The film's hero, Billy (filmmaker-actor Adam Wingard, who worked with Swanberg on \"V/H/S\"), has a day job snapping crime scene photos for the city's homicide squad. When he's off-duty, he lives his devoted girlfriend Alex (Caroline White) in a boho apartment whose guests tend to be women who are as young and stacked as Alex, and amenable to getting naked and taking part in threesomes.\u00a0 Billy also takes disturbing art photos of women. Some he knows well, others he picks up. His subjects are half-naked and trussed up and horror-movie desecrated. There's a parallel story about one of Billy's colleagues, Det. Michael Bamfeaux (filmmaker-actor Simon Barrett), who's investigating a real murder and seemingly losing his grip on sanity. I say \"seemingly\" because, like Wingard, Barrett is a filmmaker-actor who doesn't have the technical skills or raw charisma to hold our attention in a slow, moody genre picture. (This is one of Swanberg's most debilitating faults as a director: his casting, particularly in small films, is chummy when it should be artistically ruthless.)  The film is a gloss on Michael Powell's \"Peeping Tom,\" but with a sleazy, vaguely threatening atmosphere, indie film production values, and a synthesized score that evokes \"Manhunter\" and other '80s crime pictures. Its plot is a\u00a0series of situations that become more disturbing when Billy's compartmentalized art encroaches on his home life. The hero describes his photos to Alex as part of an ongoing \"fetish\" project, but they're beyond fetishistic. In fact they provoke the spectator to wonder whether, even if Billy is not a killer, he's disturbed\u2014otherwise why devote himself to \"art\" that depicts female bodies as meat? Alex wonders the same thing. So does a bar waitress (Helen Rogers, also of \"V/H/S\") whose black eye fascinates Billy to the point where he invites her to pose for him. When Billy says they're doing \"dress-up mixed with fine art\" she mockingly replies, \"Fine art? Is that what we're doing here?\" But she takes her clothes off anyway because Swanberg, like Russ Meyer before him, is a breast man. \"What am I looking at?\" That's the most persistent question raised by \"24 Exposures,\" and the director purposefully declines to answer it, presenting art and crime scene photos so that you can't immediately tell which is which. As in the European art films and American New Wave films that inspired it (\"Blow-Up\" is another touchstone), the difficulty of distinguishing the real from the reel is the point of this exercise. This is a meta movie. It's more about spectatorship and complicity than characters or situations. Advertisement \"24 Exposures\" becomes halfway intriguing if you think about it as an instance of a significant American filmmaker letting detractors provoke him into self-reflection. Swanberg has been criticized for putting extensive nudity, as well as explicit sex scenes that occasionally involve Joe Swanberg, in films that may not necessarily require them, and for objectifying actresses whose trust makes his art possible. \"24 Exposures\" doesn't rebut any of these charges, or try to, but it does take them into account. Billy (a character played by a director) might be a worst-case alter-ego for Swanberg. The character is a prolific producer of images who seems to have given no serious thought to what he puts into them, and his creativity is inextricably tied to the urge to make women take their clothes off.\u00a0 Is Swanberg pre-empting complaints about his methods by making a film about an artist who is, if not a killer, then at least creepy and unreflective?\u00a0Maybe, maybe not. But the question will only interest people who follow Swanberg's career. Everyone else will look at \"24 Exposures\" and see a meandering, indifferently acted thriller that's saying something, but not too clearly."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Kings of Summer", "Review": "High school student Joe (Nick Robinson) lives with his father (Nick Offerman), a stern man sitting on a volcano of anger. Joe's mother has died. He has an older sister (played by \"Mad Men\"'s Alison Brie), but she is engaged and out of the house. The tension between father and son is oppressive, and the rules feel arbitrary and unfair to Joe. During one night when the family gathers to play Monopoly, like they used to do when Mom was alive, the tension explodes. Joe didn't want to play anyway, he wanted to go to a party with his friends. After a fight with his dad, Joe ends up calling the police, claiming physical abuse. It's a radical move, dark and evocative of a deep psychological schism. There's a furious and smart movie inside \"The Kings of Summer,\" a first feature by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, a film about three teenage boys who take to the woods to build a house from scratch and live outside not only parental supervision but community norms and expectations. Unfortunately, despite some beautiful sequences and solid acting, the script by first-timer Chris Galletta pulls its punches, over-explains the emotional meaning of its moments, and tries to lighten the mood in sometimes awkward sit-com-style ways, betraying the movie's more honest spirit. \"The Kings of Summer\" flirts with profundity, seeming to yearn for it and fear the honest expression of it at the same time. There is much here to admire, but the overall impression is of a film that does not have the courage of its convictions. Advertisement Joe and his buddy Patrick (played by the open-faced and extremely talented Gabriel Basso) have been friends since childhood. Joe has issues with his father, and Patrick is heckled and cooed over by his intrusive well-meaning parents (played, hilariously, by Megan Mullally and Marc Evan Jackson). Nothing seems bad enough here to warrant anyone running away, but \"The Kings of Summer,\" to its credit, is going after a deeper more existential truth, common to most coming-of-age movies, the fact that teenagers are not only looking for freedom, but meaning in their lives. They want to be free to feel deeply, to connect to themselves in respect to their environments, and to choose a life that suits them. One night, after a party, Joe and another kid, a bizarre human being named Biaggio (Moises Arias, who is phenomenal in the role) get lost coming home through the woods. They come upon an open glade, dark and mysterious in the moonlight, so beautiful that the two boys stop dead in their tracks. Joe gets the idea to remove himself from his father's home, and build a house in the woods with Patrick. Biaggio, since he was there that first night, is along for the ride. Patrick bones up on survivalist books from the library, treating the project seriously, liking the image of freedom and manliness that Joe paints for him. They draw floor plans, they pilfer materials from construction sites, they spend their days out in the woods building their house. And then, one night, all three sneak away from home and move in. The community, of course, thinks they have been kidnapped and two cops (Mary Lynn Rajskub and Thomas Middleditch, both fantastic) are assigned to investigate. The parents back home wonder what they did, and Joe's dad, in one awful line, confesses to Patrick's dad, \"I think I've broken my son.\" Meanwhile, out in the woods, the three boys revel in an unfettered life, trying to catch fish and other critters, so that they will be entirely self-sufficient. Joe makes many speeches about masculinity, the script constantly reminding us of the themes underlying the adventure. Advertisement There are some good scenes where we see that a geographical change does not necessarily solve your problems. Patrick tries to tell the other boys not to litter, because it will attract animals, and Joe blows off the advice, annoyed at being told what to do. Joe has a crush on a girl, Kelly (Erin Moriarty), and despite their rule of telling no one about their Swiss Family Robinson/Moonrise Kingdom situation, Joe caves and invites her to visit. She brings a couple of friends. Over a night around the campfire, it becomes clear that Kelly is falling for Patrick, not Joe. Joe reacts with jealousy and rage, exploding at Patrick, referring to Kelly as a \"bitch\", and behaving like the worst kind of emotional bully. As a matter of fact, the contempt he shows for both of them is reminiscent of his father's cold judgmental attitude. If this is what \"being masculine\" means to Joe, it is, perhaps understandable, due to his father's poor example, but the film does not delve deeper into it. It is a giant missed opportunity. Patrick, on the other hand, seems to have a comfort with himself that is natural and easy, igniting Joe's envy. There is a beautiful random shot, unconnected to any other scene, of Patrick sitting in the woods by himself playing a mournful tune on a violin. It's gorgeously shot, and one of the few scenes where everyone is not talking about what everything means. While sitting around the campfire with the girls, we see Patrick going out of his way to make Kelly laugh. Again, the script trembles on the edge of profundity here, making acute observations about different aspects of masculinity, one of them being the ability to include women in that male circle, and to do so without hostility. Lightening the mood with humor is important to such potentially painful material, and there are a couple of legitimately hilarious scenes, mostly involving the self-serious behavior of the two cops, Patrick's parents' comedy routine with one another, and Biaggio's deadpan line delivery. But some of the schtick feels either forced or unfocused, one exchange about cystic fibrosis in particular. Lines from Biaggio like \"I don't see myself as having a gender\" or \"I can read. I just can't cry\" are not explored in a meaningful way. His words are treated as one-liners, tossed off to make an audience laugh, and never visited again, but they act as glimpses of the more honest and interesting movie that could have been. And Joe, who behaves poorly out there in the woods, never seems to come to a realization that he needs to take responsibility for his behavior. Being a man, being an adult, doesn't just mean doing whatever the hell you want to do. The script shies away from its own implications. Advertisement  Vogt-Roberts' direction is often evocative and beautiful, bordering on the surreal at times, his filming of their first glimpse of the glade by moonlight a perfect example. The montage of the boys building the shack in the woods is energetic and emotional. He has a good eye for the interesting, for the unusual image. The over-written script is to blame here. It wants to make sure we get the symbols and metaphors going on, but it also doesn't want to be caught taking itself too seriously. This is an error. Peter Bogdanovich once asked John Wayne about his famously bold gestures onscreen, and Wayne replied, \"I think that's the first lesson you learn in a high school play \u2014 that if you're going to make a gesture, make it.\" \"The Kings of Summer\" should take that advice. You have a gesture you want to make, so make it."}

(Director Scott Speer\u2019s film is actually based on a 2006 Japanese film of the same name.) Advertisement Xeroderma pigmentosum\u2014a one-in-a-million skin ailment that makes exposure to the sun\u2019s rays potentially deadly\u2014wouldn\u2019t necessarily sound like the sexiest starting point for a life-changing love. But \u201cMidnight\u00a0Sun\u201d has the benefit of photogenic, charismatic co-stars in Bella Thorne and Patrick Schwarzenegger, who have enough likability and chemistry to make this high school weepy more tolerable than it ought to be\u2014for a while, at least, until it goes off the rails and turns unbearably schmaltzy in the third act. Both actors are gorgeous, of course, which heightens the romantic fantasy of it all, but there's also a naturalism to them that's appealing. Thorne brings her well-honed Disney Channel comic timing to the role of Katie Price, a bright and talented young woman whose condition\u2014XP, for short\u2014has kept her cooped up during the daytime for the vast majority of her 17 years. (The script from Eric Kirsten allows Katie to explain her situation quickly and efficiently in narration off the top.)\u00a0Katie\u2019s widower dad (Rob Riggle, solid in a rare dramatic role) has taken every precaution to protect her from sunlight, from heavy-duty tinted windows in the house and minivan to extra security on the front door. We learn in an early conversation between him and Katie\u2019s doctor that it\u2019s actually a miracle she\u2019s lived this long. But out that fortified, second-floor bedroom window, Katie has spied on her neighbor, Charlie (Schwarzenegger in his first lead role), skateboarding down the street every day for as long as she can remember and adored him from afar. On high school graduation night\u2014which Katie and her dad commemorate with their own home-school version\u2014she and Charlie finally meet cute at the train station in their quiet suburb, where she\u2019s allowed to sing and play guitar at night and he just happens to be passing by on the way home from a party. Understandably, she tries to keep her disease a secret from him over a series of nighttime dates, just to experience the joy of feeling like a normal person for once. Advertisement This would be a good opportunity to stop and acknowledge how impossibly wholesome \u201cMidnight\u00a0Sun\u201d is, but that\u2019s also what makes it kinda refreshing. The movie exists in an alternate universe in which the hunkiest, most popular guy in school also happens to be smart and sensitive\u2014and of course, he prefers the sweet, sheltered Katie to the beautiful, bitchy cheerleader who\u2019s after him. He\u2019s a modern-day Jake Ryan. All these characters ever do is share chaste kisses and\u2014at most\u2014go night swimming in their underwear. Even the obligatory raging kegger is shockingly bereft of house trashing and projectile vomiting. But taken to an extreme, that sweetness can be cringe-inducing, as in\u00a0the scene in which Katie finally gets the guts to busk in front of a crowd when Charlie takes her out on a big-city date in Seattle. People of all ages and ethnicities suddenly appear, clapping and bopping and smiling at each other as she sings her peppy pop song. It was hard to look at it head-on\u2014I almost needed one of those shoeboxes with a pinhole in it, like you\u2019d use to view an eclipse. And that\u2019s just a harbinger of things to come as Katie\u2019s body deteriorates, but her magical powers of love and inspiration seem to grow exponentially by comparison. Having said that, Katie and Charlie push and support each other to overcome their fears and be the best they can be\u2014her with her musical dreams, him with his competitive swimming and college aspirations \u2013 in a way that\u2019s worthwhile.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Double", "Review": "It takes \"The Double\" less than half an hour to reveal who the double is. That's if you're lucky enough to avoid the movie's trailer, which just comes right out and tells you.  At that point, Peggy Lee lyrics went humming through my mind (\"Is that all there is?\"), and veteran thriller fan that I am, I began to suspect the movie had more than one double. That would be so incredible and absurd that I thought it was possible. Here is a movie constructed from basic parts at the Used Screenplay Store, with a character plugged in whenever one is required. Advertisement Still, it is a pleasure to see Richard Gere in the lead. He's an actor who has been improbably attractive all of his career and now, at 62, has only improved with age. I like the subtle catlike body language he uses, such as moving for a millisecond, pausing, then moving definitively. Or the pause in a head movement, as if we're being told: Thinking \u2026 deciding \u2026 acting. He never just flat does something. It's a form of dancing. He is permanently on poise. In \"The Double,\" he plays a retired CIA agent named Paul Shepherdson. In the history of CIA agents in movies, no retired agent is ever allowed to stay retired. He is inexorably called back to duty in connection with a big case from his youth. Given his age, there are no characters seemingly old enough to go that far back, except for current CIA director Tom Highland (Martin Sheen), but he isn't onscreen enough to qualify. Under my Law of Economy of Characters, that leaves Ben Geary (Topher Grace), an FBI agent who is 30ish and has a wife, Natalie (Odette Yustman), and child. But he's way too young. So the movie leads us to assume the big case involves entirely unseen characters. We've seen some suspects. The story opens with a group of illegal immigrants being led through the desert into the United States from Mexico by a mule. They are revealed to be Russian agents.  Think about that for a second. If you were Russia and you were trying to sneak a bunch of agents into the United States, would you assemble them in one handy group and try to sneak them past the Border Patrol? When you can buy a plane ticket from Moscow to New York? How many Russian agents do you think have entered from Mexico in recent decades? Never mind. A U.S. Senator with business ties to Russia has his throat slit in an alley. The method of murder reveals the trademark of Cassius, the CIA's code name for a Russian assassin. Is he back in the States and operating again? Shepherdson is positive he killed him years ago. Ben Geary has his doubts. The two men are asked by Highland to work together on the case. As Shephardson knows, Geary wrote his Harvard master's thesis on Cassius and knows whatever can be discovered about him.  At this point, even if we haven't seen the trailer, we know more. The suspense circles around what Geary doesn't know, and the possible danger to his life and family. This intrigue now plugs in familiar action-movie tropes, including a vicious Russian named Brutus (Stephen Moyer) with the most decorative scars around his eye I've seen in a while. There is also a car chase, and another one of those scenes where two guys split up, search a maze and meet up empty-handed on the other side. Advertisement Richard Gere always has a particular screen presence, Topher Grace is a little outgunned, but the story explains why. Poor Odette Yustman is sympathetic and affectionate, but she's been assigned the thankless and exhausting role of playing the wife of the endangered man, always there to worry about him, be endangered and put the kid to bed. The movie was directed by Michael Brandt, who co-wrote the script with Derek Haas. Together they wrote a much better movie, \"3:10 to Yuma.\" \"The Double\" doesn't approach it in terms of quality. None of it is particularly compelling. Most of the time we're waiting for the other shoe to drop. When, very late in the film, the screenplay comes up with a third shoe, that's going too far."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "The Hurt Locker", "Review": "A lot of movies begin with poetic quotations, but \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d opens with a statement presented as fact: \u201cWar is a drug.\u201d Not for everyone, of course. Most combat troops want to get it over with and go home. But the hero of this film, Staff Sgt. William James, who has a terrifyingly dangerous job, addresses it like a daily pleasure. Under enemy fire in Iraq, he defuses bombs. He isn\u2019t an action hero, he\u2019s a specialist, like a surgeon who focuses on one part of the body over and over, day after day, until he could continue if the lights went out. James is a man who understands bombs inside out and has an almost psychic understanding of the minds of the bombers. This is all the more remarkable because in certain scenes, it seems fairly certain that the bomb maker is standing in full view \u2014 on a balcony or in a window overlooking the street, say, and is as curious about his bomb as James is. Two professionals, working against each other. Advertisement Staff Sgt. James is played by Jeremy Renner, who immediately goes on the short list for an Oscar nomination. His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man is and what he feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense. He cares not for medals. He could no doubt recite patriotic reasons for his service, but does that explain why he compulsively, sometimes recklessly, puts himself in harm\u2019s way? The man before him in this job got himself killed. James seems even cockier. \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d is a spellbinding war film by Kathryn Bigelow, a master of stories about men and women who choose to be in physical danger. She cares first about the people, then about the danger. She doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room for much else. The man who wrote \u201cwar is a drug\u201d was Chris Hedges, a war correspondent for the New York Times. Mark Boal, who wrote this screenplay, was embedded with a bomb squad in Baghdad. He also wrote the superb \"In the Valley of Elah\" (2007), with Tommy Lee Jones as a professional Army man trying to solve the murder of his son who had just returned from Iraq. Also based on fact. Bigelow and Boal know what they\u2019re doing. This movie embeds itself in a man\u2019s mind. When it\u2019s over, nothing has been said in so many words, but we have a pretty clear idea of why James needs to defuse bombs. I\u2019m going to risk putting it this way: (1) bombs need to be defused; (2) nobody does it better than James; (3) he knows exactly how good he is, and (4) when he\u2019s at work, an intensity of focus and exhilaration consumes him, and he\u2019s in that heedless zone when an artist loses track of self and time. Advertisement The most important man in his life is Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), head of the support team that accompanies James. Sanborn and his men provide cover fire, scan rooftops and hiding places that might conceal snipers, and assist James into and out of his heavy protective clothing. Sanborn gives him constant audio feedback that James hears inside his helmet. It is Sanborn who has his eye on everything, who is nominally in charge, and not the tunnel-visioned James. Sanborn is a skilled, responsible professional. He works by the book. He follows protocol. James drives him nuts. Sometimes James seems to almost deliberately invite trouble, and Sanborn believes that by following the procedure, they\u2019ll all have a better chance of going home. He isn\u2019t a shirker and he doesn\u2019t have weak nerves. He\u2019s a realist and thinks James is reckless. Certainly James behaves recklessly at times, even in his use of protective clothing. He takes risks boldly. But in the actual task of defusing a bomb, he is as careful as if he were operating on his own heart. Bigelow uses no phony suspense-generating mechanisms in this film. No false alarms. No gung ho. It is about personalities in terrible danger. The suspense is real, and it is earned. Hitchcock said when there\u2019s a bomb under a table, and it explodes, that\u2019s action. When we know the bomb is there, and the people at the table play cards, and it doesn\u2019t explode, that\u2019s suspense. \t\"The Hurt Locker\" is a great film, an intelligent film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is and where they are and what they're doing and why. The camera work is at the service of the story. Bigelow knows that you can't build suspense with shots lasting one or two seconds. And you can't tell a story that way, either -- not one that deals with the mystery of why a man like James seems to depend on risking his life. A leading contender for Academy Awards.

{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "White Bird in a Blizzard", "Review": "Gregg Araki is no stranger to teen angst and provocative\r\nfilmmaking. For the last 25 years, Araki has been seemingly obsessed with the\r\nyears of sexual exploration and teenage rebellion in works like \u201cThe Doom\r\nGeneration,\u201d \u201cNowhere\u201d and \u201cKaboom.\u201d He has always been an interesting,\r\nunderrated voice in cinema (and helped reveal the dramatic depth of Joseph\r\nGordon-Levitt in his best film, \u201cMysterious Skin.\u201d) Which is what makes \u201cWhite\r\nBird in a Blizzard\u201d a true oddity in his filmography in that it\u2019s one of the\r\nfew times, arguably the only time, that he\u2019s made a film that\u2019s dull.\r\nTypically, when Araki misses the mark, he misses wildly and with fascinating\r\naplomb. \u201cWhite Bird,\u201d despite the best efforts of stars Shailene Woodley and\r\nEva Green, is flat when it should be edged; something I never thought I\u2019d say\r\nabout the man who made a movie called \u201cTotally Fucked Up.\u201d  Advertisement It is the Fall of 1988, and Kat Connor (Woodley) is about to\r\nhave her life turned upside down. Well, sorta. Working from a book by Laura\r\nKasischke that one presumes lacks the melodrama other writers would have\r\nlayered into a story about the destruction of a teenage girl\u2019s family, Araki\r\ntreats his subject matter with a heady dose of apathy. Kat\u2019s mother, the\r\nflamboyant Eve (Eva Green), just up and disappears one day. Kat suspects that\r\nher boyfriend Phil (Shiloh Fernandez) may know more about the disappearance\r\nthan he lets on, and the cops, led by Detective Scieziesciez (Thomas Jane),\r\nsuspect dear old dad (Christopher Meloni), of course. But the \u201cmystery\u201d of Eve\u2019s\r\ndisappearance is never front and center in \u201cWhite Bird in a Blizzard.\u201d To be\r\nhonest, little is front and center. Kat meanders through the hazy days after\r\nher mom\u2019s disappearance, we get a few flashbacks and then the film jumps\r\nforward for a final chapter. And that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not suggesting that all films need a grand purpose, but \u201cWhite\r\nBird in a Blizzard\u201d doesn\u2019t work as mystery or character study. It\u2019s a melting\r\npot of themes that have not only been handled more interestingly in recent\r\nyears but have been handled more interestingly within its own director\u2019s\r\nfilmography\u2014murder, apathy, obsession, sex and intrigue in suburbia. Parts of\r\nit play broad like satire, as if Araki is doing a riff on \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d\r\nbut too much of it sits there, almost as if Araki isn't excited by the material he's been given. Not all of it just \"sits there,\" however. As they often are, Araki\u2019s music\r\nchoices are clever, and I\u2019m happy to have lived long enough to have seen an\r\nextended dance scene to Depeche Mode\u2019s \u201cBehind the Wheel.\u201d And Woodley, as she\r\nso often does, grounds the film in something genuine. She has such a natural,\r\nin-the-moment presence that she keeps us interested in Kat\u2019s arc even when the storytelling\r\ndoesn\u2019t. And then there\u2019s Eva. Eva Green turns Eve into a character Joan\r\nCrawford would have told to tone it down. She is larger than life, desperate to\r\nbe the most important person in the room. And \u201cWhite Bird\u201d is at its most\r\ninteresting when Green is allowed to play the dark soul of a woman shattered by\r\nthe realization that her daughter was suddenly more interesting than she was.\r\nGreen is fantastic here, truly memorable in just a few scenes. Sadly, she\r\ncouldn\u2019t be in all of them. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Annabelle: Creation", "Review": "It used to be a pretty reliable rule of moviedom that sequels to inferior horror films were even more worthless than the original. After all, how do you build on nothing? Last year\u2019s \u201cOuija: Origin of Evil\u201d was widely and correctly considered superior to the dull original, and 2017 repeats that shocking trick with \u201cAnnabelle: Creation,\u201d a vast improvement over the monstrously awful \u201cAnnabelle\u201d from 2014. Whereas that film felt like a quickie way to cash-in on the success of \u201cThe Conjuring,\u201d David F. Sandberg\u2019s follow-up doesn\u2019t feel focus-grouped to death or spawned purely for profit margins. It has echoes of the original film, and works more with mood and less with cheap scares than either \u201cAnnabelle\u201d or \u201cThe Conjuring 2,\u201d resulting in a truly effective genre flick. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s damn closer than anyone would have predicted. Advertisement While the title makes clear that this is an origin story for one of the creepiest dolls in film history, it also sets up its own characters and universe in which to play, one that echoes the construction and themes from James Wan\u2019s original film more than any of the works that have followed. Just as that box office hit centered on a group of sisters caught in a nightmare, \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d is essentially a haunted house flick with another collection of young girls faced with things that go bump in the night. In this case, it\u2019s a group of orphans who are allowed to live in a large, isolated home when their orphanage closes. Led by Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), the girls vary in age\u2014again, like the sisters in the original film\u2014but focus immediately falls on Janice (Taliha Bateman), weakened by polio, and her sweet best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson). Any good horror fan knows that evil always preys on the weak and kind first. And so it\u2019s Janice who first notices something isn\u2019t right in the Mullins house. Sure, Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) seems like a nice enough guy, but he\u2019s overly concerned about anyone going in his deceased daughter Bee\u2019s room. And Esther Mullins (Miranda Otto) is even more mysterious, injured, bed-ridden and ringing a bell whenever she needs her husband. The girls mostly stay to themselves, but Janice is the first to notice that Bee\u2019s locked room is open in the middle of the night, and then she finds that damned doll. Before you know it, souls are being fought over, lights are going out, and religious imagery is being subverted everywhere. These movies have several themes, but one of the most prominent is the utter failure of religion to protect us from true evil. Sandberg loves to cast light through crosses on windows and gets some incredible mileage in the final act with imagery that recalls the crucifixion. Yes, believe it or not, \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d has what the first film was so clearly lacking: a strong visual language. Sandberg and his team do a marvelous job at building tension through old-fashioned horror movie means like forcing our perspective to stay with our terrified young ladies. As their eyes widen and the hair on their neck goes up regarding just what is making that creaking sound down the dark hallway, so does yours. Sandberg knows that fear manifests most greatly from the unknown and he has a ball playing with sound and light in \u201cCreation.\u201d Creaking chairs, footsteps when everyone should be asleep, that damn bell Mrs. Mullins rings\u2014all get used masterfully in the first half of the film.\u00a0 Advertisement Of course, we know all of these tricks. And Sandberg knows we know. Rarely have I seen a mainstream horror movie that riffs more playfully with the awareness of the modern horror audience. Sandberg knows that if he shows you an open door into a darkened room, your eyes are going to be planted on that darkness, searching the edges of the frame for movement, glowing eyes, whatever. If he puts Annabelle in the background, no one\u00a0is paying attention to the foreground. He has a blast with these constructions during the set-up parts of \"Annabelle: Creation.\" And then Sandberg and his team unleash the fury in the final half-hour of the film, constructing some of the best mainstream horror sequences of the last few years, including one in a barn that had the poor large gentleman next to me just whispering \u201cno, no, no.\u201d That\u2019s when you know a movie is really working. When it reduces grown men to single syllables. \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s a bit too long (109 minutes) and sometimes feels like it\u2019s making up its own story logic as it goes along. In that sense, it\u2019s more like a ghost story told around a campfire than a literal origin story\u2014a blend of religious imagery, grieving parents, weakened children, and otherworldly evil\u2014and that urban legend aspect could have allowed Sandberg and writer Gary Dauberman to lean into the insanity of their concept a bit more. The aforementioned barn sequence being a great example of when the movie knows to go crazy, but the movie often feels like it\u2019s pulling back from true risk-taking. It sometimes seems too restrained, believe it or not given it\u2019s about a possessed doll, and a few too many of the scariest scenes end ineffectively with jump scares that don\u2019t pay off like the great build-ups. But, again, it\u2019s more about what could be making that creaking sound in the hallway than the heavily made-up demon that\u2019s actually there. For the most part, \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d understands that fear. And it\u2019s now part of a totally unexpected trend that\u2019s tearing down one of this critic\u2019s greatest fears\u2014the horror movie sequel."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Lifeguard", "Review": "There's a good, dark, messy movie in \"The Lifeguard\" trying to get out.  It's there, flickering at the periphery, visible in some of the scenes, and in a lot of the performances. But it's never allowed to spill over.  \"The Lifeguard\" is hemmed in by vagueness and cliche, and nearly ruined by its soundtrack, an insistent barrage of thematically obvious alt-radio music cues. Too bad. There's some good stuff here. It's not the most original of concepts, and writer-director Liz W. Garcia struggles with the tone throughout, but \"The Lifeguard\" is often saved by Kristen Bell's sensitive and complex performance.  Advertisement \"The Lifeguard\" is the story of Leigh (Kristen Bell), valedictorian of her high school class, reporter for the Associated Press, living in New York City. We see her life in a meandering collage that opens the film.  She had been dating her editor, who then gets engaged to someone else (he says to a friend on the phone, right in front of Leigh, \"It's about time I manned up!\"). To make matters worse, Leigh wrote a story about a tiger chained in a New York apartment. The tiger died of malnutrition. Lost in the symbolism of her own story, Leigh relates to said tiger. On a moment's notice, literally mid-drink at a night spot, Leigh goes back to her apartment, packs her bag, packs up her cat, and moves home to live with her parents, not even informing them of her plans. Her parents (Amy Madigan and Adam LeFevre) are surprised, and her mother, in particular, is not all that thrilled. \"Are you having a nervous breakdown, Leigh?\" her father asks.  Leigh has always done what is expected of her and she thinks she should be allowed a break. She's a bit of a pill. She doesn't help clean up around her parents' house, and when her mother says that they \"expect her to contribute\", Leigh says, \"To what?\" Leigh magically gets her high school job back, as a lifeguard at a condo pool. The script makes the fact that she is about to turn 30 in two months a big deal, some marker filled with significance. Leigh insists repeatedly that she is \"29 and 10 months\". People sometimes go through chaotic seasons, and sometimes good films are made of such circumstances. But the \"turning 30\" thing feels artificial, an easily promotable tagline for the film.  Once ensconced in her childhood room, Leigh reaches out to a couple of old high school pals, Mel (Mamie Gummer), now the assistant principal at their old high school, who is married and trying to have a baby, and Todd (Martin Starr), a clearly closeted guy who works in an art gallery that nobody ever visits. Mel was a wild teenager. Leigh's return makes Mel start to rebel. Again, there are possibilities in this material, and we even get glimpses of how weird it could go if the movie would just let it alone.  Advertisement In her job as a lifeguard, Leigh befriends a couple of skateboarding teens named Jason (David Lambert) and Matt (Alex Shaffer). Both kids are dropping out of high school and going to move to Vermont to look for work. One of the things \"The Lifeguard\" does really well is capture the sweet restlessness of a certain kind of teenage kid. Jason and Matt are not jaded, dead-eyed cynics. They are outcasts and misfits, and both come from difficult backgrounds. They just want to be left alone. They feel they know what they need, and what they need is to get out of town. Alex Shaffer is particularly excellent at showing the agony of a boy who is dying to be free, from what he doesn't even know.  At first, Leigh takes on the role of elderly career counselor, telling them to stay in school, not \"drift\" (like she is doing). Todd, Mel and Leigh start hanging out with Jason and Matt, getting high in the woods and talking about life. Mel is panicked over how inappropriate it all is (she is the boys' Assistant Principal, after all), and she's right to be panicked, especially when Leigh starts up an affair with Jason.  There are clearly moral implications here, and true danger, something \"The Lifeguard\" tiptoes towards and then avoids. It's a giant cop-out. Leigh never fully immerses herself in that pool she watches over. The sex with the kid may be hot, but she knows this is just a stop-over. She still checks her work email. Someone submitted one of her articles for a \"journalistic prize.\" Leigh's lost state seems inherently temporary, and that lowers the stakes of the entire picture.  Someone like Jason, the teenage kid, may be on his way towards being permanently lost.  Kristen Bell is such an interesting actress, with her serious open face, reminiscent of Norma Shearer's. When Jason says to her, \"You seem so sad,\" he is telling the truth. She is given some pretty bad lines here, which she saves single-handedly by underplaying or throwing them off casually. Leigh is not easy to like and Bell is not afraid of being unlikable. It is to her credit. If only we could be allowed to watch her without having yet another swoony-angsty song telling us how we should feel about it all.  Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Hunter Gatherer", "Review": "Early in \"Hunter Gatherer\" there's a scene where the movie's ex-convict hero, Ashley Douglas (Andre Royo), walks down a Los Angeles street holding a long ladder and asking random people if they want to buy it. \"Hey, you guys want a good deal on a ladder?\" he asks two men sitting outside of a store. \"We don't buy no stolen goods here, man,\" one of the men replies. \"For your information,\" Ashley says, \"my mother gave me this ladder.\"\u00a0  I laughed hard at this. Why? There's nothing in the dialogue that indicates a laugh-out-loud moment; it's just another low-key exchange in a movie filled with them. I can't imagine a lot of other people finding it as funny as I did; comedy is so subjective. But I laughed. Maybe I laughed because of how Royo, one of the stars of \"The Wire,\" says \"my mother gave me this ladder,\" with faint indignation and exasperation, as if he\u2014a shameless hustler who turns every other exchange into a negotiation, a loser who carries himself like the king of the world\u2014is hurt by the accusation.  Advertisement But here's the unexpectedly fascinating part about this scene, which is as subtle as most of the rest of \"Hunter Gatherer\": we don't know if Ashley stole the ladder. All we know is that his mom (Celestial), whom Ashley moved in with after being released from prison, asked him to move an old refrigerator out of her backyard, and instead of doing it (\"It's too heavy,\" he mutters, without even touching it), he decided to sell a ladder lying on the ground\u00a0 behind the refrigerator. There's no scene where Ashley asks his mom if he can sell the ladder, just a cut to him carrying the ladder down the street. So maybe Ashley is right to be indignant at people thinking he stole it.  Written and directed by Joshua Locy, \"Hunter Gatherer\" doesn't look or feel like many movies being made right now. It's about African-Americans living modestly in a black neighborhood in our second largest city, and the sense of inequity and systemic discrimination is implicit in the story, but it's a quiet, gentle film, laid back without seeming sluggish. It never veers into a brutal crime plot to juice things up (as many similarly-set movies tend to do), nor does it feel compelled to make a statement about anything other than its eccentric characters' relationships to each other and the wider world.  Ashley gets a new best friend in Jeremy (George Sample III), a slightly slow man who has access to a battered pickup truck. They transport Ashley's mother's refrigerator to a disposal facility, only to learn that it costs $100 to drop it off because refrigerators use freon, which is considered a hazardous material. Ashley decides to start a used refrigerator resale business, and leans on Jeremy to help him round up old fridges and store them in his mother's backyard until he can figure out the rest of his plan.  Advertisement Then we get to know Jeremy, who is determined to fix his grandfather's homemade respirator and makes money on the side letting his body be used for medical tests. \"One time they cut off my pinky toe and reattached it with a laser,\" he tells Ashley, as matter-of-factly as if he'd had a wart removed. Ashley tells people he's striving to win back his girlfriend Linda (Ashley Wilkerson), who he lost during his prison stint through sheer neglect; if he'd only written her one letter, she tells him, she might not have taken up with a kindly garbageman named Dwayne (Antonio D. Charity). But Ashley's probably not as hung up on her as he seems to be. \"I'm always gonna love me some Linda,\" Ashley proclaims at one point,  even though he immediately gets another relationship going with Jeremys'  winsome aunt Nat (Kellee Stewart). Linda is Ashley's excuse to begin a haphazard search for redemption that transforms \"Hunter Gatherer\" into a late-sixties, early-seventies-style shaggy dog character movie, in the vein of \"Midnight Cowboy\" or \"Scarecrow.\" Movies like that are often about characters who want to be redeemed in some mysterious way, but are less-than-sensible in how they go about it.  The movie's tone is so striking partly, I suspect, because Locy is a young white man,  working in an indie hipster mode, with compassion and a certain level of  understanding, but with a predominantly black cast. (One of the film's producers is David Gordon Green, a white filmmaker from the American South who made his debut with \"George Washington,\" likewise a no-budget indie populated by actors of color.) At times \"Hunter Gatherer\" reminded me of an early work by Jim Jarmusch (\"Stranger  than Paradise,\" \"Down By Law\"), other times Spike Lee's \"She's Gotta Have  it\" and Charles Burnett's \"To Sleep with Anger,\" not just because it substitutes characterization and performance for scope and has sympathy for people living on the fringes of society, but also because it gives black actors the chance to appear in the kind of indie flick that's nearly always populated by white actors, makes the milieu working class to poor rather than comfortably middle class (as most indie hipster movies tend to do), and builds scenes not around a propulsive plot, but around characters saying things that you  or I might find odd as if they were perfectly natural.  Ashley digs hole after hole in a backyard searching for a buried toolbox containing \"my emergency objects.\" He starts one conversation with Jeremy by lying on the pavement and daring him to move him; it proves surprisingly difficult. Even characters who have one or two scenes are allowed to show us a kooky side. When the medical testing supervisor asks Jeremy if he wants something, like a glass of water, he tells her he could really go for a steak and fries, and she presses a button on a medical testing device as if it were an intercom and says, \"Tammy, we'd like a filet mignon and a side order of fries.\" Then she laughs at her own joke and asks Jeremy if he'd mind upping the number of patches he's been wearing to four, because they rarely test a young man of his race and demographic profile and they're intrigued by the results they're getting.  Advertisement Not everything in the movie works. It's another film that might have made a perfect 45 minute featurette but that feels obligated to stretch itself out to ninety for marketplace reasons; there are detours into surrealism that feel like an honorable but failed attempt to pull of the sorts of effects that Federico Fellini once achieved; and there are a couple of quasi-psychedelic bits (including one where a couple of faces pass through each other) that don't work because the director doesn't really seem temperamentally suited to that kind of filmmaking.  \"Hunter Gatherer\" is at its best letting strangeness seep into situations that are presented realistically, as in the montage of Jeremy being fitted with four large patches, each with a metal bud sticking out that can be attached to electrodes. We never find out what these patches are for, just as we never find out why Ashley was in prison or whether he asked permission to take that ladder. The things we don't know make \"Hunter Gatherer\" feel like more than strained whimsy. That and the performances, Royo's most of all. The character is a legend in his own mind, but he lingers in yours, too."}

It has sub-\"Phantom Menace\" landscapes and creatures, a bombastic and unmemorable score, and the sorts of chaotic images and fast cutting that signify a lack of true filmmaking imagination. It is truly a movie made by a committee: its direction is credited to Robert Stromberg, a longtime production designer, and its script to \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d scribe Linda Woolverton, but there have been reports of many studio-imposed rewrites, and reshoots by director John Hancock (\"The Rookie\").\u00a0But it's powerful anyway. As the title character, a misunderstood and wronged woman, Angelina Jolie has make-up enhanced cheekbones that could be registered as lethal weapons. Put them together with her wary cobalt eyes and ruby lips and the wings and horns that the character sports early in the picture, and you've got an image of female otherness as eerie as Scarlett Johansson wading into black goo in \"Under the Skin.\"\u00a0 Advertisement The film's story is an example of what The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw calls \"that emerging post-'Wicked' genre, the revisionist-backstory fairytale,\" but it's affecting. It has a\u00a0primordial edge that the clumsy filmmaking can't blunt. There are moments in \"Maleficent\" that are profoundly disturbing, in the way that ancients myths and Grimm fairy tales are disturbing. They strike to the heart of human experience and create the kinds of memories that young children\u2014young girls particularly\u2014will obsess over, because on some level they'll know, even without the benefit of adult experience, that the film is telling them a horrible sort of truth. And at this point I should give you the opportunity to step away from the review, see the film based on the above description, and read the rest later to see if you agree. Fair enough? Good. The tale begins with a flashback to Maleficent as a young girl fairy, befriending a farm boy who's snuck into her forest on a mission of thievery. They grow close and continue to see each other, even after the king of a human stronghold on the outskirts of the forest tries to invade Maleficent's domain and then watches in shock as the heroine and her tree-warrior pals lay waste to his army. As teenagers, the fairy and the human share a silhouetted lip-lock on a hilltop\u2014\"true love's first kiss,\" in the Disney parlance. He stops coming around, breaking the girl's heart. Years later, the now adult Stefan (Sharlto Copley) overhears the now-dying king promising his realm to anyone who can kill Maleficent. And it's here that we head into the first of the film's magnificently disturbing sequences. I've read reviews complaining that we don't know enough about Maleficent and Stefan's personalities, much less the details of their relationship, which means that Stefan's betrayal \"comes out of nowhere,\" and so does not make dramatic sense. This is a fair description (or complaint); but to me, the lack of development makes the twist feel more like something that might happen in a fairy tale\u2014not a clean-scrubbed Disney fairy tale in which every plot twist is clearly delineated, but an ancient story that kids might listen to, rapt and horrified, then interrupt to ask, \"By why would the boy do that to someone he loved?\", whereupon the adult storyteller would explain that sometimes people do cruel things to people they love because they want things.\u00a0 Advertisement In any event, we know what's really going on in the scene. After snuggling with Maleficent on a hilltop, Stefan gives her a drink laced with a sleeping potion, prepares to murder her after she's passed out, then has a failure of nerve. He slices off her wings instead, and brings them to the king as \"proof\" that he did as promised. It's a symbolic assault with sexual overtones, specifically an attack that occurs after a woman has passed out. Maleficent doesn't just lose her wings; they're stripped from her, against her will. The attack is also a maiming or disfigurement that, in this context, feels like a gender specific physical \"message,\" drawn from a continuum that includes everything from the punitive hacking off of a woman's long hair to clitoridectomy. (Jolie underwent a double mastectomy not long before the film was shot; it's hard to imagine her shooting this sequence and not putting it in a personal context.)\u00a0 The scene of Maleficent waking up on a hilltop with huge scars in her back, then weeping with rage, is the most traumatizing image I've seen in a Hollywood fairy tale since the Christ-like sacrifice of Aslan in 2005's \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\" It strikes so deep, and its impact resonates for so long after, that it makes the film's numerous missteps seem less like deal breakers than irritants.\u00a0The assault transforms Maleficent from an unabashed heroine into an anti-heroine\u2014a straight-up bad guy, as far as the story's terrified humans are concerned\u2014and warps Disney's vanilla 1959 film into a conflicted revenge story with an unmistakable feminist undertone. It's the deepest betrayal imaginable. Every subsequent action Maleficent takes\u2014including casting a spell on Stefan's daughter Aurora (played as a teen by Elle Fanning) that will send her into a coma at age 16 after a finger-prick by a spinning wheel needle\u2014is driven by the trauma of that betrayal.\u00a0 The film has a long way to go after that\u2014plot-wise, I mean; at a sleek 98 minutes, this is a rare summer blockbuster that's as terse as the typical cartoon feature\u2014and while \"Maleficent\" never rises to the peak of power that it attains when the heroine awakes without her wings, and its action sequences and ostentatious creature displays are murky CGI soup, it keeps the audience unbalanced in a good way.\u00a0There's wasted motion in the plotting and a fair amount of confusion in how the script spells out what Maleficent can and can't do (if she can turn a raven into a male sidekick played by Sam Riley with a wave of her hand, and create a fire-breathing dragon with similar ease later on, why doesn't she just unleash an army of monsters on the kingdom and save herself a lot of bother?).\u00a0But we always know what's at stake for her.\u00a0We know where her head is at. \u00a0 Advertisement Despite winning a slew of deserved awards for early performances, Jolie has never gotten the credit she deserves as both an old-fashioned glamorous movie star and a skilled, thoughtful actress; this part fuses both sides of her talent. Her mesmerizing stillness makes us pay closer attention to Maleficent's every word and gesture than the film's screenplay deserves.\u00a0We feel close to Maleficent even when she's doing the ice-mask-of-death expression showcased in trailers and in stills. We feel her conflicted feelings as she pretends to be the young Aurora's godmother, playing a role and then slowly becoming that role, just as we felt her rage at being violated and mutilated, and her need to make the human kingdom (whose representatives are all male) pay for what was done in its name.\u00a0\u00a0 I was looking forward to seeing Angelina Jolie play a Disney villain. That's not \"Maleficent,\" obviously, but what she's asked to do is still fascinating. The character starts out good, turns bad for good reason, then tries to right the wrongs she committed in the name of righting wrongs. This is a film of Hollywood storytelling cliches, including the eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too villain death that lets the heroine seem noble while still satisfying the audience's bloodlust. But it's also a film of resonant gestures and dream logic, in which ancient and contemporary predicaments jostle against each other: romantic betrayal or sexual assault, and their psychological aftermath; the fundamental differences between male and female minds; the way that patriarchal culture fuses women's sense of self-worth to their bodies; even the tangled maternal impulses that independent single women who never wanted kids might experience when they have to care for a child. The movie is a mess, but it's a rich mess. It has weight. It matters.\u00a0Years from now you'll hear teenagers or college students bonding over having seen it as child and lost sleep over it, and its title will have acquired three more words, plus punctuation: \"Oh My God, Maleficent!\""}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Ride Along", "Review": "\"Ride Along\" really isn't much of a movie, but the quality that makes it mostly watchable, and occasionally enjoyable, is the fact that it seems to know that it isn't much of a movie, and doesn't push against that fact too much. The bottom line here is, if you're a fan of pint-size motormouth Kevin Hart's stand-up comedy, you're likely to have fun with this. Just don't go looking for a motion picture with credible characters or an overly involving story.  In point of fact, \"Ride Along\" points out several times that what it is is a comedically rebooted \"Training Day,\" this time with glowering but teddy-bearish Ice Cube in the Denzel role and Hart\u2026well, you can't say he's in the Ethan Hawke role. Hart plays Ben, a school security guard (his stay-in-school lecture to a recalcitrant high-schooler is an early comedy highlight of the movie) eager to make it into the police academy so he can propose properly to his girlfriend Angela (Tika Sumpter), whom he also aims to frequently make acquainted with an appendage, or is it a persona, he calls \"The Black Hammer.\"\u00a0 Advertisement While Ben may be a, um, tool in the sack, he's a near-hysterical bungler and sometime slacker outside of it (he's really into online shooter-gaming). Hence, Angela's brother James doesn't believe Ben is a worthy future-in-law. And of course James is the Cube character, a hard-bit detective who's ready to go rogue in pursuit of a never-seen Atlanta crime kingpin who goes by the name of\u2026wait for it\u2026\"Omar.\" Oooh. After a heated argument in which the inept Ben falls all over himself to prove James' assumptions about his lameness wrong, James makes Ben a shifty offer: Ride along on a day in James' life on the force, and see how he holds up. Of course, James arranges for the day to be filled with routine annoyances that he thinks will bore Ben senseless\u2014and out of the yen for policing. The strategy works for a while. Ben really proves James' low opinion of him by failing to quell a kiddie disturbance on a basketball court while James is pursing an informer (a nice cameo from \"Saturday Night Live\"'s Jay Pharaoh). But soon grandiose Ben starts sniffing out the fact that James is working on a larger case. And soon, sure enough, the chance to smoke out \"Omar\" arrives, with a few twists, or should I say \"twists,\" in tow.  One reason \"Ride Along\" doesn't quite parse as a story, especially given its ultra-inevitable conclusion, is that Ben really is kind of an idiot. As played by Hart, he is, of course, at certain times a manically funny idiot, and Ice Cube, who's not exactly a slouch at aggressive comedy himself, is pretty smart here to just lay back and play straight man to Hart's riffing. Only every now and then Hart's riffing flags, and you get a scene when Hart's character is compelled to restrain a beefy sallow white guy stripping down in a fancy supermarket and pouring honey on himself, and you think, \"Ugh, weak-tea grossout humor is arguably more off-putting than the full-bore variety,\" and that makes you ready to check out of the movie, but then Hart does something funny again.  By the time \"Omar\" reveals himself (any movie buff worth his or her salt will recognize the young version of the actor playing him early in the movie, in the \"only known photo\" of the character) the movie has given up pretty much any claim it has on being good, but by the same token, it's self-aware enough not to entirely wear out its welcome. As Tika Sumpter finally gets to do something in the movie, that is, become a prop for the villain, I braced myself. \"Oh dear, now there's going to be some kind of 'funny' car chase\u2026\" Spoiler alert: No car chase. The movie sputters to its happy ending, the post-credit sequence offers a final bit of amusing Kevin Hart content, and everyone goes home happy. Okay, maybe not happy, but also not pissed-off.

{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Coco", "Review": "\"Coco\" is the sprightly story of a young boy who wants to be a musician and somehow finds himself communing with talking skeletons in the land of the dead. Directed by Lee Unkrich (\"Toy Story 3\") and veteran Pixar animator Adrian Molina, and drawing heavily on Mexican folklore and traditional designs, it has catchy music, a complex but comprehensible plot, and bits of domestic comedy and media satire. Most of the time the movie is a knockabout slapstick comedy with a \"Back to the Future\" feeling, staging grand action sequences and feeding audiences new plot information every few minutes, but of course, being a Pixar film, \"Coco\" is also building toward emotionally overwhelming moments, so stealthily that you may be surprised to find yourself wiping away a tear even though the studio has been using the\u00a0sneak-attack\u00a0playbook for\u00a0decades.    Advertisement The film's hero, twelve-year old Miguel Riviera (voice by Anthony Gonzalez), lives in the small town of Santa Cecilia. He\u2019s a goodhearted child who loves to play guitar and idolizes the greatest popular singer-songwriter of the 1920s and '30s, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), who was killed when a huge church bell fell on his head. But Miguel has to busk in secret because his family has banned its members from performing music ever since Miguel's great-great-grandfather left, abandoning his loved ones to selfishly pursue his dreams of stardom. At least that\u2019s the official story passed down through the generations; it\u2019ll be challenged as the film unfolds, not through a traditional detective story (although there\u2019s a mystery element to \u201cCoco\u201d) but through an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d journey to the Land of the Dead, which the hero accesses through the tomb of his ancestors.\u00a0    Family and legacy as expressed through storytelling and song: this is the deeper preoccupation of \u201cCoco.\u201d One of the most fascinating things about the movie is the way it builds its plot around members of Miguel\u2019s family, living and dead, as they battle to determine the official narrative of Miguel\u2019s great-great grandfather and what his disappearance from the narrative meant for the extended clan. The title character is the hero\u2019s great-grandmother (Renee Victor), who was traumatized by her dad\u2019s disappearance. In her old age, she has become a nearly silent presence, sitting in the corner and staring blankly ahead, as if hypnotized by a sweet, old film perpetually unreeling in her mind.    The machinations that get Miguel to the other side are too complicated to explain in a review, though they\u2019re comprehensible as you watch the movie. Suffice to say that Miguel gets there, teams up with a melancholy goofball named Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), and has to pose as one of the dead with the aid of skeletal facepaint, but that (like Marty McFly returning to the 1950s to make sure his mom ends up with his dad in \u201cFuture\u201d) the longer Miguel stays on the other side, the more likely he is to end up actually dead.    Advertisement I\u2019m reluctant to describe the film\u2019s plot in too much detail because, even though every twist seems obvious in retrospect, Molina and Matthew Aldrich\u2019s script frames each one so that seems delightful and inevitable. Many of them are conveyed through a stolen family photograph that Miguel brings with him to the Land of the Dead. The deployment of the photo is a great example of how to tell a story through pictures, or more accurately, with a picture. Somebody\u2019s face has been torn out; there\u2019s a guitar that proves to be important later, and there are other ways in which visual information has been withheld from Miguel (and us) so that it can be revealed or restored when the time is right, completing and correcting an incomplete or distorted picture, and \"picture.\u201d What\u2019s freshest, though, is the tone and outlook of the film. \u201cCoco\u201d opened in Mexico a month before it opened in the USA and is already the highest grossing film of all time there. It assumes a non-American point-of-view on spirituality and culture\u2014not in a touristy or \u201cthought experiment\u201d sort of way, but as if it were merely the latest product of an alternate universe Pixar Mexicano that has existed for just as long as the other one. The film\u2019s stable of voice actors reads like a Who\u2019s Who of Latin-American talent: the ensemble includes Edward James Olmos, Alfonso Arau, Ana Ofelia Murguia, Alanna Ubach and, in a small role, to my surprise and astonishment, playwright Octavio Solis, who was one of my teachers in high school back in Dallas. Michael Giacchino's score is unsurprisingly excellent, as are the original songs\u2014in particular, the future Oscar winner \"Remember Me,\" the greatest tear-eruption mechanism to accompany a Pixar release since the \"Toy Story 2\" centerpiece \"When She Loved Me.\" Like most Pixar productions, this one is filled with homages to film history in general and animation history in particular. I was especially fond of the references to the dancing skeletons that seemed to pop up constantly in cartoon shorts from the 1930s. There\u2019s a touch of Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki in the film\u2019s matter-of-fact depiction of the dead interacting with the living, as well as its portrayal of certain creatures, such as a goofy, goggle-eyed dog named Dante (modeled on Xoloitzcuintli, the national dog of Mexico) and a gigantic flying dragon-type beast with the personality of a plump old housecat.  Advertisement Also notable are the film's widescreen compositions, which put lots of characters in the same frame and shoot them from\u00a0the waist up or from head-to-toe, in the manner of old musicals, or\u00a0Hollywood comedies from the eighties like \"9 to 5\" or \"Tootsie.\" The direction lets you appreciate how the characters interact with each other and with their environments and lets you decide what to look at. At first this approach seems counter-intuitive for a movie filled with fantastic creatures, structures and situations, but it ends up being effective for that very reason: it makes you feel as though you're seeing a record of things that are actually happening, and it makes \"Coco\" feel gentle and unassuming even though it's a big, brash, loud film.  I had some minor quibbles about \u201cCoco\u201d while I was watching it, but I can\u2019t remember what they were. This film is a classic."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "The Strange Little Cat", "Review": "Taking place almost entirely within the claustrophobic confines of a  middle-class Berlin apartment, Ramon Zurcher's debut film, \"The Strange  Little Cat,\" features a curious and alert tabby, busy scratching on  doors, batting its paws at a fluttering moth, staring out the window,  its tail flicking, or strolling about on the kitchen table. The cat is  not strange. But the film sure is, strange and creepy and entertaining.  It's like reading a short story by Chekhov or Ionesco, that was  translated by Kafka (the film is very very loosely based on  \"Metamorphosis\"), and then staged by Bertolt Brecht. Or Barnum &  Bailey. The cat isn't an observer. It is a participant in the circle of  family life, wrapped up in its own concerns, wanting what it wants,  strolling in and out of the frame as it pleases. Up above its head, or  off to the side, the droning mundane family conversations go on and on.  In \"The Strange Little Cat,\" the mundane may very well be the strangest  subject of all. Advertisement From the very first shot, we are clued in that there are depths of  strangeness to be plumbed in even the smallest and most banal  interactions. A little girl (Mia Kasalo) sits at a kitchen table,  writing something on a pad of paper, and occasionally opening her mouth  to scream at the top of her lungs, timing her screams to the roar of the  blender (off-camera). Grown-ups pass around her, their heads above the  frame, their conversations droning and banal, not acknowledging her.  What we are seeing is a regular family morning, but the framing from  cinematographer Alexander Hasskerl creates an enormous amount of  tension. That tension lasts throughout the film, a strength of its  relatively short running time. There is a Mother (Jenny Schily), who busies herself with food  preparation, her back to the camera. The framing, again, creates tension  in what is a normal everyday moment, a mother cutting fruit on the  counter. But the fact that her back is turned, so often, begins to seem  ominous. When she turns to look at her family gathering in the kitchen,  there is an intense remote quality to her face which can be quite  frightening, but you're never sure if you're projecting or not. Is she  about to fly the coop? There's a disturbing moment where she looks down  at the cat, eating at its food bowl, and she hovers her foot just above  the cat's head, as though she is contemplating crushing it. As the family gathers\u2014sons, daughters, their significant others, a sick  grandmother, a couple of uncles\u2014they chat with one another, crowding  through the kitchen. Someone will start speaking, sharing an event that  took place over the last couple of days. The mother shares a story about  going to the movies, and how the man next to her in the theatre placed  his foot on top of her foot and she wasn't sure how to move her foot  away. One of the older daughters shares a story about how she was  walking in the park, throwing down slices of orange rind, and how  strange it was that the orange part of the rind always landed face-down.  These stories are related in a flat-affect tone, which makes the  proceedings feel like an avant-garde theatre piece, with individual  actors stepping downstage and addressing the audience directly. In some  cases, the events described are shown in dreamy flashback. Advertisement All of this is quite haunting and hypnotic. The stories shared seem to  have, at their crux, the feeling that the world is a completely  mysterious place, where people and objects often behave in baffling  ways. The monologues continue, and people stroll in and out of the kitchen,  down the dark hallway, and back, and the apartment begins to take on a  life of its own. Objects start to rebel against the functions they were  meant for. Buttons fall off of people's shirts. Drinks spill. The  radiator has a weird echo. The washing machine is broken. A glass bottle  spins on the stove. A ball flies in through the kitchen window, thrown  from the courtyard below, an alarming moment when the belljar of the  family dynamic is shattered by an interloper. At the family dinner later  in the film, one of the fat sausages on the table squirts grease wildly  when someone cuts into it, causing hilarity. The refusal of objects to  behave appropriately and do what they were meant to do is reminiscent of  Jacques Tati's use of that trope repeatedly, to great comedic effect,  in \"Playtime,\" where a neon sign in a drugstore suddenly becomes a halo,  due to the placement of the priest below it, or fat leather chairs make  embarrassing fart-sighs when people sit down on them. There is a young son in the family, a little deadpan boy, who stands and  stares at the cat scratching at a door, or at the family dog who is  busy keeping his eye on the family cat, and the little boy says,  vaguely, to a nearby grownup, \"Is the cat/dog supposed to be doing  that?\" He never gets an answer. He seems to be the only one in the  family who is aware that the objects around them are in out-and-out  rebellion. Perhaps as a way to acknowledge that unspoken reality, he  flies a little automated helicopter into the crowded kitchen, where it  floats around through the grown-ups before crashing into a nearby fruit  bowl. Nobody notices. There is tension here between different family members. The little girl  is slapped across the face at one point by the Mother. Mother criticizes  the sounds her older daughter makes when she drinks her juice. But the  tension really comes from the get-go, from the static strange framing,  and the palpable sense that Zurcher and his cinematographer give that  something is not quite right here.\u00a0 The source of the tension remains  buried, which gives \"The Strange Little Cat\" a Harold Pinter-type  energy. Pinter wrote pauses into his scripts, pauses that actors  are encouraged to follow as though they are rests in a musical score.  The pauses add to the ominous sense that something is coming; something  gigantic is happening beneath the placid surface. It doesn't matter that  the characters are talking about washing machines and orange peels.  Something is going ON. The revelation may be that \"all\" that is going on  is the normal stresses of everyday family life, filmed in a way that  highlights the airless intimacy and the devotion-to-the-banal nature of  all of it; the ways we talk around each other, above each other; the way  we repeatedly \"miss\" each other, especially when we are in such close  quarters. Advertisement The only music in the film (\"Pulchritude\" by Thee More Shallows) is used  sparingly and specifically, and it usually marks the entrance of the  cat into the action, after a room has cleared. The music seems to act as  a cue: the humans have left the room, the cat can breathe more freely  now. People do behave in strange ways. Objects do rebel. We do live alongside  animals who have intentions and concerns of their own. Who can figure  it all out? \"The Strange Little Cat\" doesn't provide answers, and  doesn't reveal its underlying structure or mythology. The mystery is  almost total. That's the fun of it."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "In the Valley of Elah", "Review": "I don't know Tommy Lee Jones at all. Let's get that clear. I've interviewed him, and at Cannes we had one of those discussions at the American Pavilion. He didn't enjoy doing it, but he felt duty-bound to promote his great film \"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.\" During my questions, he twisted his hands like a kid in the principal's office. He remains a mystery to me, which is why I feel free to share some feelings about him. I'm trying to understand why he is such a superb actor. Look at the lines around his eyes. He looks concerned, under pressure from himself, a man who has felt pain. Look at his face. It seems to conceal hurtful emotion. He doesn't smile a lot, but when he does, it's like clouds are lifting. Listen to his voice, filled with authority and hard experience. Notice when he speaks that he passes out words as if they were money he can't afford. Whether these characteristics are true of the private man, I have no way of knowing. Advertisement Paul Haggis' \"In the Valley of Elah\" is built on Tommy Lee Jones' persona, and that is why it works so well. The same material could have been banal or routine with an actor trying to be \"earnest\" and \"sincere.\" Jones isn't trying to be anything at all. His character is simply compelled to do what he does, and has a lot of experience doing it. He plays a Vietnam veteran named Hank Deerfield, now hauling gravel in Tennessee. He gets a call from the Army that his son Mike, just returned from a tour in Iraq, is AWOL from his squad at Fort Rudd. That sounds wrong. He tells his wife, Joan (Susan Sarandon), that he's going to drive down there and take a look into things. \"It's a two-day drive,\" she says. He says, \"Not the way I'll drive it.\" He checks into a cheap motel. His investigations in the area of Fort Rudd take him into topless bars, chicken shacks, the local police station, the base military police operation and a morgue where he's shown something cut into pieces and burned, and he IDs the remains as his son. Looking through his son's effects, he asks as a distraction if can have his Bible, while he's pocketing his son's cell phone. It's been nearly destroyed by heat, but a friendly technician salvages some video from it, filled with junk artifacts but still retaining glimpses of what it recorded on video: glimpses of hell. To describe the many avenues of his investigation would be pointless and diminish the film's gathering tension. I'd rather talk about what Haggis, also the co-writer and co-producer, does with the performance. Imagine the first violinist playing a note to lead the orchestra into tune. Haggis, as director, draws that note from Jones, and the other actors tune to it. They include Charlize Theron as a city homicide detective, Jason Patric as a military policeman, Sarandon as Deerfield's wife, and various other police and military officers and members of Mike's unit in Iraq. Advertisement None of these characters are heightened. None of them behave in any way as if they're in a thriller. Other directors might have pumped them up, made them colorful or distinctive in some distracting way. Theron could (easily) be sexy. Patric could (easily) be a bureaucratic paper-pusher. Sarandon could (easily) be a hysterical worrier, or an alcoholic or push it any way you want to. You know how movies make supporting actors more colorful than they need to be and how happily a lot of actors go along with that process. Not here. Theron, who is actually the co-star, so carefully modulates her performance that she even ignores most of the sexism aimed at her at the police station. Nor is there any hint of sexual attraction between her and anybody else, nor does she sympathize with Hank Deerfield and work on his behalf. Nor, for that matter does she compete with him. She simply does her job and raises her young son. I don't think there's a scene in the movie that could be criticized as \"acting,\" with quotation marks. When Sarandon, who has already lost one son to the Army, now finds she has lost both, what she says to Jones over the telephone is filled with bitter emotion but not given a hint of emotional spin. She says it the way a woman would, if she had held the same conversation with this man for a lifetime. The movie is about determination, doggedness, duty and the ways a war changes a man. There is no release or climax at the end, just closure. Even the final dramatic gesture only says exactly what Deerfield explained earlier that it says, and nothing else. That tone follows through to the movie's consideration of the war itself. Those who call \"In the Valley of Elah\" anti-Iraq war will not have been paying attention. It doesn't give a damn where the war is being fought. Hank Deerfield isn't politically opposed to the war. He just wants to find out how his son came all the way home from Iraq and ended up in charred pieces in a field. Because his experience in Vietnam apparently had a lot to do with crime investigation, he's able to use intelligence as well as instinct. And observe how Theron, as the detective, observes him, takes what she can use and adds what she draws from her own experience. Advertisement Paul Haggis is making good films these days. He directed \"Crash\" and wrote \"Million Dollar Baby,\" both Oscar winners, and was nominated as co-writer of \"Letters from Iwo Jima.\" He and his casting directors assembled an ideal ensemble for this film, which doesn't sensationalize but just digs and digs into our apprehensions. I have been trying to think who else could have carried this picture except Tommy Lee Jones, and I just can't do it. Who else could tell Theron's young son the story of David and Goliath (which took place in the Valley of Elah) and make it sound like instruction in the tactics of being brave?"}

Advertisement After two sequels that took the fun spirit of the \u201cTransformers\u201d and turned them into something with the artistic depth of a Monster Energy Drink, Bay appeared to reboot the franchise with the relatively solid \u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction.\u201d He found one of our most charismatic leading men in Mark Wahlberg, gave him an awesomely perfect name like Cade Yeager, filled out a better-than-average supporting cast, and provided major set pieces across the world, including leveling a bit more destruction at Chicago. \u201cAoE\u201d suffered from Bay Bloat (165 minutes!) and some of the other technical problems of the previous sequels, but it offered hope. Hope dies during \"Transformers: The Last Knight.\" From the very beginning, this is an incoherent mess. Cade\u2019s daughter and her boyfriend\u2014both memorable characters from the last film\u2014are gone, the daughter written off with a couple of horrendously manipulative beats about her being at college and Yeager being on the run. He can save the world but he can\u2019t see his daughter. Whatever, fine, but also gone are Stanley Tucci (other than a brief cameo as Merlin in the opening scenes) and Kelsey Grammer. The villains of the first film are replaced here by a purely CGI enemy named Quintessa (Gemma Chan), an interstellar being who wants to use the home planet of the Transformers to destroy Earth by basically crashing them into one another. She\u2019s such a cartoonish, poorly designed villain that she never feels like a real threat.  I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. \u201cThe Last Knight\u201d picks up relatively where the last film left off. Optimus Prime is headed back to his home planet to tell the universe to leave Earth alone. Yeager is now in hiding, as being a massive alien robot is still against international law, and he's still aligned with the remaining Autobots. He\u2019s \u201cin hiding\u201d in the biggest auto field in the Midwest, but those kind of logical leaps are easy to let slide in a summer blockbuster when it\u2019s working. He has a new assistant (Jerrod Carmichael), is working on repairing Bumblebee, and gets a spunky preteen sidekick who feels like the character sitcoms used to add late in their run when everyone knew the original kids got too old (think Sam on \u201cDiff'rent Strokes\u201d). And then pretty much all of the set-up\u2014including any sort of immigration analogy about the fear of foreigners represented by the hunted Transformers\u2014is thrown out. There\u2019s a point in the script when you can literally tell when it was handed to a different writing crew. It starts as one movie and then, bizarrely, takes a hard-right turn to England and becomes something else entirely. Advertisement You see, Yeager found a talisman on a dying transformer, and that relic ties him to the long and storied history of the aliens. As these films have grown in budget, Bay has piled on more and more mythology, and I think the reason this is billed as the final chapter is because there\u2019s literally nowhere else to go. Through remarkably expository scenes courtesy of Sir Anthony Hopkins and John Turturro, we learn that people have known about the Transformers for centuries and that notable geniuses like Mozart and FDR helped keep their existence a secret. In return, the robots gave the human race gifts, including the Transformer watch that killed Hitler. No, I\u2019m not making that up.  Weaving the mythology of these killer cars into world history isn\u2019t a bad idea, and reflects the tongue-in-cheek pleasure these movies could have been (I\u2019d watch the heck out of \u201cBumblebee vs. The Third Reich\u201d) but it\u2019s all so thinly and poorly handled here. Before you can truly enjoy it, we\u2019re back with the revelation that Cade now has a connection with the Transformers (because of the talisman and because of some other nonsense I couldn\u2019t begin to explain) and his new gorgeous friend Vivian (Laura Haddock) is the only one who can wield Merlin\u2019s staff, a necessary skill to save the Earth.  You\u2019re saying, \u201cHow could a movie that weaves together metal dragons, Merlin\u2019s staff, Sir Anthony Hopkins and world-killing aliens be all that bad?\u201d Because it\u2019s just not fun. More than any film Bay has made, \"The Last Knight\" is incoherent to the point of parody. Action scenes are poorly choreographed, dialogue is weaker than ever, and plot twists make no sense. At one point, the leads are on a submarine and I couldn\u2019t for the life of me tell you why. Not only is it transparent that no one involved bothered with the plot\u2014Wahlberg has never given such a lazy performance as he does here\u2014but the editing and effects are stunningly shoddy. There\u2019s no geography to any of the scenes, so you can\u2019t tell what the heck is happening. At least the last film had a few action set pieces that worked and the third film had the destruction of Chicago to wow viewers. This film does not have a single memorable action sequence in it. And it starts at such a ridiculous pitch that it has nowhere to go\u2014Yeager is reintroduced shooting a robot in slow motion. Bay has always been willing to forego things like rising action or building tension to try and blast viewers to their seats from first frame to last. But it gets so exhausting to watch another movie that starts at 11 and then never varies the volume. Advertisement Here\u2019s where the chorus of Critic-Proof Franchises kicks in. Michael Bay made this for fans of the franchise and not the notoriously-hard-on-it critics. Diehards will ignore that I liked the first film and parts of the third and fourth films (the second is still a cinematic abomination). I get it. We love to forgive the failures of franchises we adore. Even critics do that. But even fans of this series have to take a hard look at the outright, shocking laziness of this movie\u2014one that does the bare minimum to get butts in seats. Even in bad action movies, there\u2019s often a glimpse of artistic potential gone awry or attempts to entertain that just didn\u2019t work. I began to actively try to find that here, to find a way to see how this went off the rails. I came to the conclusion that no one cared. There\u2019s just so little effort to make sense or make it interesting, even for the fans. It was a contractual obligation and a paycheck. They could have called it \u201cTransformers: Someone Needs a New Beach House.\u201d"}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "War on Everyone", "Review": "Something terrible must have happened to John Michael McDonagh, the screenwriter and director, after he made \u201cCalvary.\u201d That 2014 movie, a darkly comic murder mystery and a relentlessly but purposefully morbid exploration of mortality and faith, made me pretty eager to see whatever its creator had up his sleeve next. But this ostensible satire on American cops, crime movies, American values or lack thereof, intellectualism and anti-intellectualism, racism, and so on, is so hackneyed, tired, labored and overstuffed with contempt not only for all of its targets but also its own self that one gets the feeling that the talented Mr. McDonagh has gone mad with rage. Possibly during dealings with the American film industry. Advertisement Still, that\u2019s no excuse for a movie that begins with a mime joke. Yeah, a mime joke. You just can\u2019t get enough of those, can you? The film\u2019s protagonists, Terry and Bob, played by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Michael Pe\u00f1a respectively, are police detectives in nice blue suits driving a cherry vintage American car and chasing a mime. Terry asks Bob if a mime will make a sound if you hit it with a car, so they\u2019re that kind of cops. They find out, and to justify the gag, a bag of cocaine is found on the mime, who does make a sound and who also bleeds from the mouth after being hit with the car, which is undamaged.  In the early scenes of the film, McDonagh shoots a lot of bright flat, tableaus, and accompanies them with corny horns-blaring Cop TV Show music. One gets to suspecting that he\u2019s going to cough up something like a feature-length version of the video for the Beastie Boys\u2019 \u201cSabotage.\u201d If only. The shooting style is meant to accentuate a certain absurdism: Terry and Bob are such awful cops that the crude jokes they make require a certain arty underpinning. Walking into the New Mexico police station where they work, they observe, \u201cLook at all those fu**ing a**holes working\u201d; \u201cSuckers.\u201d Terry has a thing for Glen Campbell. Bob and his wife enjoy trading literary aphorisms and debating their origins. After finding a guy who\u2019s pegged to be the driver in an upcoming heist, Bob accepts that perp\u2019s bribe of a flat-screen TV and an XBox; the next scene shows the TV mounted above another TV; on the bottom screen, his two kids, including one comically obese one, are playing video games, while on the screen above it, Bob is trying to watch \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d a film, he explains to his wife is by the \u201cJewish-American auteur\u201d Steven Soderbergh. His wife corrects him: \u201cHe\u2019s Swedish.\u201d Do you find any of this funny? Because there\u2019s so much more of it. Here\u2019s an exchange between the film\u2019s villain, Lord James Mangan, and his fey henchman, Birdwell (Caleb Landry Jones, who clearly studied Gary Graham\u2019s work in Paul Schrader\u2019s \u201cHardcore,\u201d as well as every homophobic stereotype in a \u201870s Ken Russell film):\u00a0  \u201cYou know what the worst thing about jail is?\u201d asks Lord James of Birdwell. \u201cNo, your lordship.\u201d \u201cThe violent anal sex. Do you know what the best thing about jail is?\u201d \u201cThe violent anal sex?\u201d Advertisement \u201cYou\u2019re pretty quick for an American.\u201d  Trying to get in on some heist action, the fellows inveigle an ex-con who\u2019s converted to Islam (at one point he\u2019s seen playing a doubles match of tennis with two women in burqas, ar ar ar, but it\u2019s not a racist joke because the women are superior players, ar ar ar) and once the con (Malcolm Barrett, whose performance affords the movie its only measures of anything resembling fun) absconds with the money to Iceland, the movie\u2019s plot complications turn more whimsical, necessarily.  But nothing here actually works, at least for any sustained amount of cinematic time. This is one of those movies in which the filmmaker has decided the fat jokes he\u2019s putting in are, in fact, savage condemnations of fat jokes, but they\u2019re really just fat jokes, and not very good ones at that. The Skarsg\u00e5rd character\u2019s obsession with Glen Campbell is such a circa-1998-Tarantino-derivation that McDonagh, unless he\u2019s completely brain-damaged, has to believe it\u2019s a trans-dimensional meta lampoon of a Tarantino derivation, because there\u2019d be no other reason to include it. AND YET, the way it actually plays is as a plain derivation. (The soundtrack also contains a Lee Hazelwood song and some other stuff that one of McDonagh\u2019s assistants might have picked up for him on Record Store Day a couple years back.) Poor Tessa Thompson, of \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cDear White People,\u201d is here compelled to play a stripper who falls for Terry, and she\u2019s depicted reading John Hersey\u2019s \u201cThe Algiers Motel Incident,\u201d just to show you that her character, and her character\u2019s creator, are really above all this, which assertion begs certain questions.  Into the nothing-sacred dynamic, the movie eventually introduces a child pornography theme, which compels its wayward characters to do the right thing, or a right thing. Too little, too late. The Iceland-set scenes are very nice to look at though."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Charlie Countryman", "Review": "Every now and then, one comes across an indie film that's so showily awful, so drenched in bathos and clich\u00e9, and yet features such a uniformly sharp cast that you have to wonder: \"What is it with actors?\" Or, if one already knows what it is with actors, \"Did this material actually look good on paper?\"\u00a0 The heavy-sigh-inducing \"Charlie Countryman\" is just such a motion picture. It's a\u00a0thoroughly queasy pastiche of magic-realism/coming-of-age/romantic-thriller/bloody-Chiclets nonsense (and when I say \"nonsense\" I am substituting a much stronger word). It starts on a\u00a0note familiar to anyone familiar with Sundance Film Festival entries in the ten years that followed \"Reservoir Dogs.\" \u00a0A young man, his face beaten to a pulp, is hanging from a rope tied to his leg and attached to a crane hoist at the other end; he dangles above a body of water as men with guns observe him from dry land. We hear the report of a shot fired, and into the water he falls, and\u2026 Advertisement It's just a dream, or is it a portent? Out of the bathtub pops Charlie, coming to, face intact, roused by dad Vincent D'Onofrio to visit the hospital to see his mom, Melissa Leo, taken off life support.\u00a0 Charlie not only has vivid dreams, he seems to have a sixth sense, as dead mom then visits him in the hospital corridor to tell him to \"Go to Bucharest.\" And yes, \"are you sure she didn't mean Budapest?\" does become a running \"joke\" in the movie. After a brief pause to bother an ex-girlfriend played by Aubrey Plaza, there's Charlie on a plane.   How he comes to meet non-manic somewhat-damaged pixie almost-literal Dream Girl Gabi is a scenario that would not be enhanced by synopsizing. But meet her he does. She's played by Evan Rachel Wood (who's fine, despite the fact that there are maybe a hundred actual Romanian actresses who would have been fine too), and she's all punky and dour of countenance, and she plays the cello. Charlie, of course, falls for her like several years' worth of output from a brick fantasy. Skeptical Gabi warns him off: \"Perhaps you have some sort of fantasy about sad woman from distant land who plays the cello.\" Perhaps a smart producer might have informed writer Matt Drake and director Fredrik Bond that self-consciously pointing out the hoariest commonplaces in your dumb hipster romantic fantasy doesn't automatically absolve you from them.   And Gabi has a husband, who's a Very Bad Man With Poor Social Skills (Mads Mikkelsen, who need only glower a lot to achieve full Mikkelsen effect), and Charlie gets kicked over to a youth hostel (a really grungily utopian youth hostel, I gotta admit) where he kicks it with Harry Potter vet Rupert Grint, here playing a wannabe porn performer (that's ONE way to distance yourself from the franchise). Later, in a great \"what are the odds\" \"twist,\" Charlie and friends get in trouble at a strip club run by a former associate of Mikkelsen's character (Til Schweiger, completely wasted), and the plot, as they say, thickens.  Advertisement As you might have inferred by now, I found all of this pretty insufferable. And Shia LaBeouf, in the title role, only made it all worse. Over the years LaBeouf has transmogrified from an appealing teen performer (I really enjoyed him in 2003's \"Holes\") into a too-efficient delivery system for overamped Michael Bay smarm. His compensating attempts at indie cred, or something like it, seem less convincing every time out, and his performance here is particularly lame. He reminds me here of Chuck Jones' obnoxious cartoon character Charlie Dog, who aggressively seeks an owner by pointing out his own \"soulful brown eyes,\" which he then widens to disarming-in-the-wrong-way effect. The rest of the cast does, I think, more sincere work, but again, as they do, you can't help but wonder why. Because this is bad stuff, from stem to stern."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "A Stray", "Review": "Musa Syeed is a master of silent characters. He filled his previous film, \u201cValley of Saints\u201d (2012), with people who spoke little with words, but much with expressions. His new film, \u201cA Stray,\u201d offers the same. While his previous film took us into the lives of two friends in colorful Kashmir, this film follows a young man through the little-seen, vibrant world of Somali refugees in Minneapolis. For many viewers, this terrain will be just as foreign. These are quiet films with heavy emotions. The film opens with Adan (Barkhad Abdirahman, \u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d) staring at a canary sitting in a cage. Frustrated that his friends will not speak to him with respect\u2014because he has no money and does not work\u2014he releases the bird, which soon crashes into a window and dies. That is the direction his own life seems to be taking. Advertisement He sees himself in that canary; many of the shots in this film show Adan either looking into cages or squeezed in tight spaces. He is a young, astray man who cannot help but break rules, alienating everyone. He has conversations in his head with the Divine, wondering about his place in the world. He casually tells people, \u201cI\u2019m bad luck.\u201d Rather, he is a square peg in a round hole, the young man who cannot fit anywhere, so he seems rebellious, but cannot help it. His mother has given up on him, and kicks him out of her home. The local Imam lets him stay briefly in the local mosque, and prays with him to find forgiveness and a friend. Soon, his prayer gets answered: he meets a restaurant owner who gives him a job delivering food. As he drives on his first assignment, his car hits a stray dog, and from there, the story unravels.  The dog here is, for Syeed, a conscious choice (as opposed to a cat). Many Muslims regard dogs as so filthy that they do not let them in their homes. Adan has a moment of pause when he has to pick up the dog, but takes him on what becomes a sort of road movie through Minneapolis, looking for a home and a way to part from the dog.  Forgetting to deliver the food, now he tries to figure out how to take care of the dog, trying veterinarians and animal shelters. There is a sequence in the Coen Brothers\u2019 \u201cInside Llewyn Davis,\u201d in which the title character has to handle a runaway cat, which plays comically. Here, Adan\u2019s relationship with the dog becomes the film\u2019s foundation, taking us through the story of a stray man caring for a stray dog. Every place he goes with the dog, one or both of them are not welcomed. Further, the dog becomes a symbol of Somali integration, in how the various characters\u2014Somali or not\u2014interact with the dog. Some welcome. Some are repulsed. Some caress. Some play. Some fear the dog. Some, through religious obligation informed by the same Islam as the others, are concerned for the dog.  Syeed manages to pack in many subplots and themes given this tight film is less than 90 minutes long. Adan\u2019s mother believes he has stolen her jewelry. Adan meets a small group of Native Americans, getting into a conversation with them about immigration. The Somalis in Minnesota seem to get news attention either in cases related to terrorism or cab drivers refusing to deliver alcohol. This film touches on terrorism through a subplot involving FBI surveillance, with an entertaining climax as Adan must translate a very personal, intimate phone call from a local to a religious scholar in Somalia, which an agent believes relates to national security.  Advertisement Syeed takes us deep into the communities, showing us exactly what we should expect: people making ends meet while they find their place in their new world. The neighbors are friendly, unlike the overall immigration and security agencies which discard refugees until they spy on them.  Films exploring the foreign tend to be exploitative, emphasizing stereotypes, or they tend to be anthropological exercises by liberal westerners exploring the \u201csavages.\u201d Despite my extensive experience across Muslim America, I have not spent time in these Somali communities. Syeed\u2019s work, however, provides a sense of authenticity, through casual conversations, close-ups that are not preceded by establishing shots that soon reveal elements off-screen, and attention to small details, as though we are present in these worlds as much as we are watching them. In addition to being a tender film about a man finding redemption in caring for a canine, Syeed\u2019s pious film is refreshing, showing us a corner of America that we never see."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Una", "Review": "Great actors Ben Mendelsohn and Rooney Mara do their best to elevate the frustrating \u201cUna,\u201d but their director doesn\u2019t seem to understand what he has in these two performers, constantly pulling back from their raw emotion and complex characters. \u201cUna\u201d should be a searing two-hander, a showcase for two performers to dissect gender roles, sexual abuse, and more. But director Benedict Andrews and writer David Harrower, who adapts his own play Blackbird, are constantly diffusing their own film, likely in a desire to make it more \u201ccinematic\u201d and less \u201ctheatrical.\u201d This is an overblown and over-used concern. When done well, \u201ctheatrical\u201d films can be riveting\u2014reminding us of the intimate power of phenomenal acting\u2014but filmmakers often reduce what worked about their source material in an effort to expand it to the big screen. Such is the case with \u201cUna,\u201d which I would imagine was unforgettable on the stage but is difficult to pin down on the big screen. Advertisement Una (Mara) is introduced in the way young, \u201ctroubled\u201d woman are so often in independent cinema, dancing at a club and then having a quick sexual encounter in the bathroom. She wakes up the next morning, and has clearly made a decision, picking up her things and driving. She will arrive at the workplace of a man whose colleagues know him as Peter, but she knows his real name is Ray (Ben Mendelsohn). Ray used to be Una\u2019s neighbor, and is notably older than she is. In flashbacks, we see glimpses of a young girl, a 13-year-old Una, with a younger Ray, and the fuzzy picture becomes clearer before Una puts words to it. Ray abused Una. The two were so involved that they almost ran away together, but Ray was caught and did four years in jail. Why has Una tracked him down so many years later? What does she hope to get out of him and what other secrets could he reveal?    The best element of \u201cUna\u201d on a screenwriting level is the complexity Harrower allows his duo. Well-captured by Mara, Una is a maelstrom of emotions, still sometimes looking like the 13-year-old girl who\u2019s more upset that Ray left the night they had sex than he abused her in the first place. Abandonment seems to be her overriding emotion, and not just about that night specifically, but overall. She\u2019s still stuck in the same small town, where everyone knew her story and where she\u2019s been unable to move on, whereas Ray has a whole new life with a new partner and a good job. Why is that fair? Meanwhile, Ray is first presented as someone who realizes he made a horrible mistake but attests that he truly loved Una and had never done anything similar before or would do anything similar after. He argues repeatedly that he\u2019s not a child abuser, but Andrews and Harrower allow suspicion to creep in on the viewer. Is Ray a broken man who made a horrible mistake or a lifelong predator? Mendelsohn captures this complexity well, always able to find shades of menace under his characters. They're both fantastic. The problem with \u201cUna\u201d is structural. At first, it seems interesting that Ray and Una\u2019s first encounter in years will come at his office as the world goes on around him and the sound of co-workers leaks through the walls. However, it soon feels like \u201cUna\u201d the film can\u2019t sit still. We meet Ray\u2019s co-worker Scott (Riz Ahmed), who may get fired that day, and Ray and Una have to hide from his boss. The thematic undercurrent is there\u2014this is a relationship hidden from society\u2014but it\u2019s underdeveloped and distracting. \u201cUna\u201d works when Mendelsohn and Mara are allowed to look in each other\u2019s eyes and convey years of rage and regret, and less so when it feels like the film is actively trying to get in their way.

To quote The Waco Kid, Sly Stallone\r\nand his band of merry old action stars \u201ckill more men than Cecil B. DeMille,\u201d\r\nyet somehow this is more kid-friendly than bare breasts. In fact, no one in \u201cThe\r\nExpendables III\u201d takes his shirt off, presumably because Terry Crews\u2019 obscenely\r\nmassive pecs alone would almost guarantee an R. Advertisement It is genuine\r\nfarce to follow the gore-soaked prior installments of this franchise with one\r\nwhere people manage to get shot 72 million times yet never lose an ounce of\r\nblood. Throats are slit and villains are impaled on impressive-looking cutlery\r\nwith suitably gruesome-sounding effects, yet the bodies may as well be filled\r\nwith air or Lucky Charms marshmallows. When one considers that \u201cThe Expendables\r\nIII\u201d plays as a torch-passing from my generation of action fans to the current\r\ngeneration, that PG-13 is an old man\u2019s sly jab at the toughness of young\r\nwhippersnappers. The audience for the first \"Expendables\" grew up on the hard-R\r\nbrutality its stars dished out in the '80s and early '90s. Once the younger actors\r\nof today get tossed in the mix, the series suddenly takes a kinder, gentler\r\napproach to its extreme violence. This has to\r\nbe an intentional wink from Stallone and his contemporaries. They know their\r\ndays are not only numbered as action stars, but probably should have ended long\r\nago. It\u2019s no longer just about old-school smashmouth displays of force in today\u2019s\r\nactioners. Tech-savviness is the new black. As crazy as this sounds, this isn\u2019t\r\na hypothesis crafted from thin air; it\u2019s actually the plot of \u201cThe Expendables\r\nIII.\u201d  Barney\r\n(Stallone) hires a new, younger crew after his usual cronies botch a mission.\r\nBarney feels his old band of brothers have given enough to the Expendables, so\r\nhe retires them. Part of the change of heart stems from Barney\u2019s realization\r\nthat Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), a man he once thought he killed, is the target of\r\nthe botched mission. Stonebanks shoots Caesar (Crews), sending Barney on the\r\nguilt trip that leads to his disbanding of the team.  After\r\ndemanding that his crew enjoy the rest of their lives, Barney embarks on a\r\nsuicide mission with his younger charges, all of whom are skilled not only in\r\ncombat but also in those computer thingees Barney just doesn\u2019t understand. Of\r\ncourse, the new kids on the block manage to get kidnapped by Stonebanks,\r\nforcing Barney to call his old team back into action. This is a glorious pander\r\nto my middle-aged brethren.  We\u2019ve come\r\nto the part of the review where I\u2019m supposed to justify my favorable rating by\r\ntelling you to \u201cturn your brain off\u201d in order to enjoy \u201cThe Expendables III.\u201d I\u2019m\r\nnot going to do that, because that\u2019s an insult to you, me and the movie.\r\nInstead, I want you to pay close attention to \u201cThe Expendables III\u201c, because if\r\nyou\u2019re on its wavelength, you\u2019ll discover an incredibly self-aware streak of obsessive\r\ncompulsion running through it. When it comes to nostalgic detail, this is a\r\nRussian nesting doll of a movie. Allusions beget deeper allusions, tying the\r\nlevels together in an almost endless game of \u201cSix Degrees of Action Movie Separation.\u201d\r\nThere\u2019s a Marvel Universe-sized dollop of slavish devotion for fans of\r\nStallone, Schwarzenegger, Statham and Gibson. Advertisement For example,\r\nAntonio Banderas co-stars as Galgo, a candidate for Barney\u2019s new crew. Banderas\r\nand Stallone last appeared as antagonists in the Wachowskis\u2019 \u201cAssassins\u201d.\r\nRather than recreate that character, Banderas instead plays a cross between\r\nPuss \u2018n Boots and Joe Pesci\u2019s Leo Getz character from the \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d\r\nseries. Gibson repays the favor by repeating a line from Banderas\u2019 \u201cDesperado.\u201d\r\nIn the climactic action sequence, Gibson also gives viewers the chance to see Riggs\r\nfrom \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d battle Rambo for the belated title of \u201cCraziest Tough Guy:\r\n\u201880s Edition\u201d.  Schwarzenegger\r\nrepeats catchphrases from \u201cCommando\u201d (\u201cI lied\u201d) and other movies, while Wesley\r\nSnipes makes his entrance on a literal money train (minus Woody Harrelson)\r\nbefore reuniting with his nemesis from \u201cDemolition Man.\u201d Even that PG-13 evokes\r\nmemories of the rating on the third installment of the R-rated Mad Max series\r\n(starring Stonebanks himself). Practically every line and every combination of\r\nthe older Expendables characters evokes this type of connection, and the movie\r\nknows it\u2019s doing so. That contributed greatly to my good time. If you choose\r\nnot to get trapped in the movie\u2019s spider web of nostalgia, there are still\r\npleasures to be had. Gibson sinks his teeth into his big villainous monologue,\r\nand seeing him with his mouth taped is sure to inspire applause. Snipes gets a\r\ngood joke about tax evasion and several action scenes to remind us that we\r\nshould \u201calways bet on black.\u201d There\u2019s charming chemistry between Statham and\r\nStallone, and a helicopter-flying Harrison Ford shows up to use the type of\r\nlanguage Spielberg and Lucas wouldn\u2019t let him use as Han Solo nor Indiana Jones.\r\n Advertisement The younger\r\nExpendables are given the Muppet Babies treatment; they\u2019re portrayed as\r\nmini-versions of their original counterparts. Standing out from this bunch is\r\nMMA fighter Ronda Rousey who displays a leadership quality that aligns her with\r\nBarney despite her stereotypical entrance fighting several men while dressed\r\nfor maximum hotness. I hope I live to see the day when a woman open a six-pack\r\nof Whup-Ass while decked out in curlers and furry Mommy slippers rather than a\r\nminiskirt and heels.  As dopey and\r\nbloodless as the action sequences are, they keep the film moving at a brisker\r\npace than its 2-hour-plus running time indicates. The film culminates with a\r\nscene so preposterous that, if it is indeed Stallone\u2019s swan-song in the action movie\r\ngenre, it\u2019s a worthy exit. We\u2019ve seen hundreds of instances of heroes\r\noutrunning Joel Silveresque fireballs. Stallone outruns an entire building as\r\nit collapses from strategically placed bombs. It\u2019s no spoiler that he survives,\r\nbut after this, there\u2019s nothing left to prove and no place to go but down.  Unlike most\r\nfilm series, \u201cThe Expendables III\u201d sows the seeds for its own youthful reboot.\r\nLet\u2019s hope \u201cThe Expendables 4\u201d is filled with \u201cRocky III\u201d-style montages of\r\nStallone and company imparting expertise before riding off into a calm,\r\nexplosion-free sunset. This series has run out of nostalgia to coast on, but\r\nwhat a final burnout it had."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Superbad", "Review": "\"Superbad\" is a four-letter raunch-a-rama with a heart, and an inordinate interest in other key organs. It is autobiographical, I suspect, inspired not just by the lives of co-writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who named the two leads after themselves, but possibly by millions of other teenagers. The movie is astonishingly foul-mouthed, but in a fluent, confident way where the point isn't the dirty words, but the flow and rhythm, and the deep, sad yearning they represent. The movie involves best friends Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera), who have been inseparable, mainly because they were equally unpopular, and now face the ordeal of attending different colleges. It is three weeks until the end of the high school year, bringing to mind the ancient truism that if you haven't had sex yet and you don't have it soon, you will never have had sex in high school. Such deprivation used to be commonplace; I am of the opinion that only about two members of the Urbana High School graduating class of 1960 had experienced sex, but I'll double-check at our next reunion. I will say, though, that at the end of senior year, third base was seeing a lot of traffic. Advertisement Seth is the pudgy, curly-haired one, and Evan is thin and has worried eyes. They have a sidekick named Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who is so unpopular, he is unpopular even with them. They all feel lust for every girl in the school, but are so stuck for conversation that sometimes they simply say what time it is, as if they've been asked. To their wonderment, Seth, Evan and even Fogell are invited to a party on the last night by the uber-popular Jules (Emma Stone), who belatedly explains that it's not a BYO party, but a BYOAEE party (bring your own and everybody else's). Their attempts to buy booze while underage are more bizarre than some I have witnessed, involving Fogell's production of an ID card claiming he is \"McLovin,\" and they discover that being the guys who bring the booze is a powerful deterrent to unpopularity. (Note: Underage drinking is WRONG.) Jules is very happy to see the three friends and their brown paper bags, and Evan is amazed that even the fragrant Becca (Martha MacIsaac) has a smile for him, and lots else. To be sure, the lads are not seeking perfect love. They have heard about girls who get drunk and sleep with the wrong guy, and their modest ambition is simply to be the wrong guy. (Note: There is a thin line between being the wrong guy and being a criminal.) Fogell, for that matter, would be happy to even be the wrong wrong guy. (Note: Let's stop these notes and make a blanket announcement: This movie was made by professionals. Do not attempt any of this behavior yourself.) But back to Fogell. What strange ability do teenagers have, to always choose the school's future millionaire brainiacs and call them by their last names? For Fogell, poor wretch, there is nothing left in life but to found Microsoft. The actor in the role, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, is an actual high-schooler who got the job at a casting call, and it may be a starmaker. I am informed by the \"Superbad\" expert David Plummer: \"There are already T-shirts being sold with 'I Am McLovin' printed on them.\" Advertisement Anyway, two cops (Bill Hader and co-author Seth Rogen, in what I assume is a non-autobiographical role) bust the party, and so original is this film that they are not the usual bullies, but young enough that when a door opens upon the likes of Jules and Becca and the brown paper bags, they begin to lean eagerly over the doorsill. The movie reminded me a little of \"National Lampoon's Animal House,\" except that it's more mature, as all movies are. It has that unchained air of getting away with something. In its very raunchiness, it finds truth, because if you know nothing about sex, how can you be tasteful and sophisticated on the subject? In its treatment of adolescent sexual yearning, \"Superbad\" remembers not only the agony but the complete absence of the ecstasy. I remember in eighth grade some kid asked how long you could entertain an impure thought before it got upgraded from a venial to a mortal sin. \"There aren't rules for things like that,\" the sister explained, \"but I'd say that after five seconds, you're asking for it.\" The kid and his buddy went down to his basement to study his dad's collection of Playboys, and he got a stopwatch and had his buddy punch him in the arm every four seconds."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Trade", "Review": "'Trade\" is a movie about trade in human beings; in this case, a 13-year-old Mexican girl who is kidnapped and brought to New Jersey, where her virginity will be auctioned on the Internet for an expected $50,000. Chillingly, the movie is based on fact, on an article by Peter Landesman in the New York Times Magazine. And it's not an isolated case. The girl, named Adriana (Paulina Gaitan), is handed off in a smooth cross-country operation. She finds only one friend along the way, a kidnapped older Polish woman named Veronica (Alicja Bachleda-Curus). Their transportation is handled by Manuelo (Marco Perez), a cruel man with a deeply buried streak of morality that begins to trouble him along the road. Advertisement The trip from Mexico to New Jersey turns into a chase, although Manuelo and his captives don't know it. Jorge (Cesar Ramos), Adriana's 17-year-old brother, sees her (against all odds) kidnapped in Mexico City and follows Manuelo's car all the way to the border by one means or another (against even greater odds). At a crucial moment near the border, he meets a Texas Ranger named Ray (Kevin Kline), and after some verbal scuffles, they join forces to follow Manuelo, rescue his captives and penetrate to the heart of the slave-smuggling operation. A nasty, vile business, made more slimy because director Marco Kreuzpaintner doesn't trust the intrinsic interest of his story, and pumps it up with chase details, close calls, manufactured crises, and so many scenes of the captives being frightened and abused that they begin to seem gratuitous, even suspect. Yes, it is evil that these heartless gangsters, connected with the Russian mafia, terrorize young women and sell them as objects. But is it not also evil that the film lingers on their plights with almost as much relish as the camera loved the perils of Pauline, tied to the railroad tracks? My description makes the film sound more urgent than it is. The German-born director seems to have fallen in love with the American genre of the road film, and there are altogether too many shots of the trip itself, the land it covers, the roadside civilization, the open spaces. What is fascinating, in a scary way, are the details of the Internet auction business, how it works and the money made in it. When I watch those TV shows where pedophiles are pounced on by cops, I think \"entrapment,\" but you know what? Some people are asking to be entrapped. How about that Florida federal prosecutor just the other day who flew to Michigan hoping to meet a 5-year-old girl? Your rights to do what you want in your sex life run into a dead end, I believe, when they involve someone else doing what they don't want. All obvious, although not to some deranged creeps. But what is the purpose of this movie? Does it manipulate its subject matter a little too much in its quest to be \"entertaining\"? Why should this material be entertaining? Anything that holds our interest can be entertaining, in a way, but the movie seems to have an unwholesome determination to show us the victims being terrified and threatened. When I left the screening, I just didn't feel right. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Generation P", "Review": "\"Generation P\" appears to be Russian slang for Generation Perestroika and \"The Pepsi Generation,\" which nicely reflects this film's cockamamie spirit, sort of a cross between \"Mad Men\" and an acid trip. Set in the years immediately after the fall of communism, \"Generation P\" would have been unthinkable any earlier, and now is merely incomprehensible. It is said to be a huge success in Russia \u2014 a daring, transgressive satire. Non-Russians, however, may need a program to understand the players. The film's hero is Babylen Tatarsky (Vladimir Epifantsev), jobless and homeless at the outset, then reduced to manning a shabby kiosk where he sells cigarettes one at a time. Through an old mutual friend, he's lured into Russia's advertising industry (\"It's a Gold Rush! But in a few more years, it'll all be snatched!\"). Advertisement These establishing scenes are the movie's most entertaining. Babylen free-associates with his new colleagues about Coke and Sprite, Marlboros and Parliaments. His nifty new tag line for Sprite (the UnCola) is shot down because it already belongs to 7-Up. His inspiration for Parliaments (put the Russian Parliament on the package) gets a little further. Untold sums of money begin to roll in. Babylen undergoes a fashion makeover and cuts his scraggly hippie hair. All fun. And if director Victor Ginzburg had kept pushing in that direction, the film might have been more successful. Maybe he was simply following the source novel by Victor Pelevin, unread by me. The movie begins to come apart when Babylen overdoses on LSD (\"enough for a battalion\") and the movie goes berserk in acidland. The hero's name is inspired by Babel and its fateful tower, and indeed, he begins speaking in words no one can understand. Inside a weird structure resembling the Tower of Babel, he encounters the priests of a cult and seems to go tiresomely astray. I learn from Variety that director Victor Ginzburg was a Russian expatriate working in Venice, Calif. The movie, by Russians and for Russians, contains interesting notions of their view of the U.S. Our consumer goods are fascinating to them. Babylen and a colleague discuss why America \"hates\" them. It's because they buy American cars, cigarettes and clothes, and then Russians get back American money. By that token, China hates the United States, too.  A lot of the film's material involves the use of CGI to create fake Russian political figures and even run them for office. No doubt that stuff will reverberate comically in Russia, but American viewers may feel a little lost."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Iran Job", "Review": "While in Poland last July, I learned of a film called \"Czarodziej z Harlemu,\" or \"Magician From Harlem.\" Its origins were Polish, but its plot was pure Hollywood: A foreign basketball team imports an African-American man named Abraham Lincoln to help them win a championship. Wackiness ensues, or so I'm told. The visions of \"Magical Negro\" dancing in my head kept me from seeking out \"Magician From Harlem,\" but its plot was the first thing I thought of when I heard about \"The Iran Job.\" The description sounds like a real-life fish-out-of-water tale crossed with a sports movie. But the film wants to be more than that, and I'm on the fence about how well it succeeds. Advertisement \"The Iran Job\" follows Kevin Sheppard, a St. Croix native who is recruited by an Iranian basketball team to help lead them to the playoffs. I don't believe the team, A.S. Shiraz, hired Sheppard because of his skin color, but I did wonder if he had been the only candidate who accepted. It's 2008, and as Sheppard's relatives point out, Iran isn't the safest place for Americans to be. \"The Iran Job\" never explicitly describes the recruiting process, but it clearly spells out the grounds for termination: If A.S. Shiraz doesn't make the playoffs, Sheppard fouls out of the league.\u00a0 I confess to being a sucker for sports movies, the ones with the \"Big Game\" at the end. \"The Iran Job\" has all the requisite elements of that cinematic subgenre, but strives for something deeper. A.S. Shiraz is the newest edition to the Iranian Basketball Super League, a promotion of sorts, so all eyes are on them to make history by becoming the first team to reach the playoffs in their first year. Iranian basketball rules allow for each team to recruit two foreign players from any country willing to send them. Sheppard is joined by a Serbian he calls Z; the two room together and are the most experienced members of the team.\u00a0 The rest of the team is young and untrained. After their first practice session, Sheppard is stunned by their skill set, or lack thereof. \"That was the worst [expletive] I've ever seen,\" he tells the camera. The coach makes him team captain, but Sheppard soon realizes that the fans share his fired-up enthusiasm more than his teammates. Sheppard's tenacity would play better in the league he failed to make after graduating Jacksonville University: the NBA. But here, \"You get angry at them, and they play worse,\" the coach basically tells him. Sheppard changes his captain's plan of attack.\u00a0 Advertisement He also has to modulate his temper on the court; his angry tossing of a trash can after a close loss is carried by every channel in Iran and gets him in legal trouble. The fans can be rowdy, with the men on one side and the women on the other, but players are expected to play by the rules with no disciplinary issues. If the NBA had Iran's strict rules of sportsmanlike conduct, half the players would be in jail.\u00a0 As you'd expect, with Sheppard and Z's help the team gets better. They start winning, and \"The Iran Job\" follows their peaks and valleys in brief vignettes. It's comical how many games come down to last-minute shots or fouls, yet my sports loving Pavlovian responses sucked me into the suspense every time. The Iranian press and sportscasters take notice, especially of Sheppard, and the team's fan base grows as they march toward a potential playoff spot. Helpful onscreen graphics chart the team's rise and fall during the 24-game season, giving us the names of the other teams and their placement.\u00a0 The top eight teams in the 13-team league will make the playoffs, a one-game elimination round much like the NFL's. Documentaries don't have spoiler warnings, so I can tell you A.S. Shiraz makes the playoffs. I can further tell you that, in continuing with real-life's parallel track with sports movie clich\u00e9, A.S. Shiraz has to face last year's champion and the toughest team in the league, Mahram Tehran. \"We could get our asses blown OUT!\" Sheppard tells the camera. I wouldn't dream of telling you if they do.\u00a0 \"The Iran Job\" is two documentaries in one: The sports aspect coexists with Sheppard's observations of a foreign land. We know enough about basketball for those scenes to exist as shorthand while the Iranian elements are more fleshed out. Like Sheppard, the audience is learning about a country through dialogue and experiences. These two parts of \"The Iran Job\" complement each other, sometimes essentially so, but there are instances where there's a jarring dissonance. Writer-director Till Schauder nicely underplays the outcome of the Big Game, but also mishandles a crucial news item revelation the movie had quietly been building toward.\u00a0 Advertisement Schauder keeps us at arm's length from some of the people who populate \"The Iran Job.\" Sheppard remains something of an enigma the entire film, even though he's talking to the camera. In fact, most of the men merely exist, with only occasional fleeting glimpses into their psyches. For example, Z talks to Sheppard about the horrors of being in Serbia during days and days of bombing, but the conversation is reduced to a few vague lines of narration. Sheppard plays matchmaker for a team member, and counsels another whose girlfriend has dumped him, but neither of these incidents are allowed to blossom into meaningful interactions between teammates.\u00a0 \"The Iran Job\" gets much more mileage from its female subjects. Despite being a disembodied voice for most of her scenes, Sheppard's girlfriend does a lot to define herself for viewers. Her discussions with Sheppard and, at the beginning of the film, with us, allow us to get to know her, and to see Sheppard through her eyes. \"He tells me everything he's going to do at the last minute,\" she says, \"so that I don't have time to react, or to cuss him out.\"\u00a0 We also meet Elaheh and Laleh, two Iranian women and the most interesting people in the film, who befriend Sheppard and serve as vessels of information for us. Allowing them to describe how they feel about their homeland is the secret weapon of \"The Iran Job.\" Their navigation of the rules of male-female interactions, and their independent, outspoken views, keep \"The Iran Job\" from descending into another tale of The Other as seen through our eyes. Sheppard is surprised (as are we) to discover how these women, who deal with so many rules about their conduct and appearance, manage to be anything but downtrodden and dejected. Reports of the unrest going on during Sheppard's tenure seem destined to connect with the outspoken passions of Elaheh and Laleh; when they indirectly do, \"The Iran Job\" does a sloppy job handling it. It's almost a throwaway moment in the film.\u00a0 Like I said, I'm on the fence here. I've watched the film twice, and both times, I wished I'd gotten either the sports documentary or the life-in-Iran documentary. Combining them seems to give both halves short shrift, despite strong moments in each. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Knock Knock", "Review": "A couple of sexy, scantily clad and soaking wet young women knock on the door of a happily married, middle-aged husband and father of two\u2014who happens to be home alone on a long, holiday weekend\u2014in Eli Roth\u2019s \u201cKnock Knock.\u201d The words \u201cEli Roth\u201d in front of the title should tell you that it won\u2019t just be about illicit, titillating fun, followed by an obligatory bit of remorse. But this time, the longtime horror director doesn\u2019t go for the gore the way he gleefully did in his early films (\u201cCabin Fever,\u201d \u201cHostel\u201d). Instead, he aims to disturb us on a deeper level: He wants to hit us where we live. Literally. Advertisement Roth\u2019s film, which he directed and co-wrote, is an update of a trashy little exploitation flick called \u201cDeath Game\u201d from 1977. (The two actresses who were its stars, Sondra Locke and Colleen Camp, get producing credit here while Camp appears in a brief supporting role as a nosy friend). His intention, he says in the film\u2019s press notes, was to demonstrate how much more quickly we experience everything in the social media age\u2014both the delights and the torments\u2014and how the rules of civilized society no longer seem to apply. But he makes his point far clearer in the notes than he does in the movie itself. Roth skillfully builds tension until the moment when everything snaps and goes insane, followed by a series of shrill and repetitive scenes of increasing torture and destruction, all of which leads to The Big Reveal of what inspired these vicious games. As a piece of social satire, \u201cKnock Knock\u201d winds up being not just toothless but anticlimactic. But it does feature Keanu Reeves, who\u2019s game for all the craziness that comes his way in the leading role. He stars as Evan, an architect living in a coolly sprawling minimalist home filled with colorful, modern art in the hills outside Los Angeles. Roth sets\u00a0the mood rather elegantly off the top, with long, gliding camerawork over the Hollywood sign, through Malibu canyons and down serene, suburban streets until he winds up at Evan\u2019s front door. Clearly, this is an idyllic place\u2014which the presence of Evan\u2019s flirty, artist wife (Ignacia Allamand) and adorable son and daughter confirms. Nothing could possibly go wrong here. There almost seems to be an intentional awkwardness to these early interactions between Evan and his family;\u00a0they\u2019re too happy and perfect, like folks you\u2019d see forced\u00a0together\u00a0in a catalog. At first, it's as if\u00a0Roth and co-writers Nicolas Lopez and Guillermo Amadeo are toying with the notion of domestic bliss, only to hold it up to the light, examine it and crush it to pieces later on. The execution never feels quite so focused, however. With the wife and kids away on a beach trip, Evan uses the weekend to catch up on a project, enjoy some red wine, maybe smoke a little pot and listen to his treasured vinyl on the turntable. But then, there\u2019s a knock at the door on the one night there happens to be a torrential downpour in drought-stricken Southern California. Standing on his front porch, giggling and dripping in itty-bitty clothing, are the brunette Genesis (Lorenza Izzo, Roth\u2019s real-life wife) and blonde Bel (Ana de Armas), who must be half his age. Advertisement The two friends insist innocently that the cab dropped them off in the wrong spot on the way to a party, and now they\u2019re lost, so could they please come in and use the phone? And maybe take off their clothes and throw them in the dryer? As Julianne Moore says so drolly in \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d while showing Jeff Bridges the porno movie \u201cLogjammin\u2019\u201d: \u201cLord, you can imagine where it goes from here.\u201d And it does go there\u2014sort of\u2014in time. The playful pals snuggle up in fluffy, white robes while waiting for their clothes to dry and the car service to arrive (which takes an estimated 45 minutes, conveniently). As they get friskier and more suggestive with Evan, he genuinely tries his best to be a gentleman and remain loyal\u2014scooching over to a different chair, or going out of his way to compliment his wife\u2019s sculptures. The first half of the film is far superior to the second, as Roth takes his time and keeps us guessing as to who these girls really are and what might happen. Reeves\u2019 easygoing, low-key screen persona serves him well here and provides an intriguing contrast to Izzo and de Armas\u2019 hypersexuality. But then! And this really isn\u2019t a spoiler, because something\u2019s gotta give\u2014something does give. Roth shoots the m\u00e9nage a trois with surprising taste and restraint\u2014and that\u2019s the last moment of taste and restraint you\u2019ll get from him. The next morning, \u201cKnock Knock\u201d shifts abruptly and becomes an insanely over-the-top version of Michael Haneke\u2019s \u201cFunny Games.\u201d (Pick the version of your choice. There are two). Genesis and Bel reveal their true selves\u2014we think\u2014as noisy, destructive, overgrown children. And the trouble is, the change happens out of nowhere; they become crazy people too quickly, and the change in tone is jarring. More problematic: Because their characters become so unbelievable in the extent to which they make Evan\u2019s life a living hell, it\u2019s impossible to become truly frightened by their actions or threats. They\u2019re more screechy and annoying than anything else, like bratty tweens jacked up on sugar and caffeine. Reeves, meanwhile, eventually amps up (and camps it up) as well, delivering a long and profane tirade while tied to a chair with an electrical cord. \u201cI was a good guy! I\u2019m a good father!,\u201d he screams\u00a0and spits\u00a0in vain, reminiscent of Nicolas Cage\u2019s awesomely outlandish work at the end of Neil LaBute\u2019s \u201cWicker Man\u201d remake. That one moment suggests the cult B-movie that\u00a0\u201cKnock Knock\u201d could have been. Instead, the ending\u2014with its revelation of what these girls were really after all along\u2014is so frustrating, you\u2019re likely to wonder: Is that all there is? Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Step", "Review": "Some of the best documentaries of this century feature trajectories that lead up to a competition that requires a specific talent, be it a spelling bee (\u201cSpellbound\u201d), a dance-off with grade-schoolers (\u201cMad Hot Ballroom\u201d) or a crossword-solving tournament (\u201cWordplay\u201d). This film, however, is a soul-stirring, foot-stomping and inspirational step beyond most in that its final showdown is only the beginning of a path towards a brighter future for the participants\u2014namely, members of a step team who are about to become part of the first graduating class of the Baltimore Leadership School for Young Women. \"Step\" is both a buoyantly uplifting celebration of African-American womanhood and the dedicated educators who have their backs. The real prize here isn\u2019t a trophy but the assurance that each and every senior will head off to college despite the obstacles they face in their daily lives.\u00a0 Advertisement Filmmaker Amanda Lipitz, a Broadway producer making her feature-length directing debut and a Baltimore native herself (she and her mother were involved in the founding of the BLSYW charter school in 2009), focuses on three distinctly different members of the Lethal Ladies squad. Blessin Giraldo, with her dimpled smile and innate sense of style (oh, the hairdos you will see), is blessed with movie-star glamour, fierce determination, a palpable physicality and an outsized personality that immediately designates her as a leader.\u00a0 That she has a Marilyn Monroe poster on her bedroom wall that stares down on her as she performs her beauty regiments like a pro says it all. This captain and founder of the team possesses a quotable facility for translating her passion into words, declaring that \u201cstep is life\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re making music with our bodies\u2014that\u2019s some slick stuff.\u201d  But academically, Blessin is adrift. Her single mother, Geneva, is prevented from being fully engaged in her daughter\u2019s life as she copes with waves of depression and anger issues. These are traits that her daughter also deals with. She missed 53 days of school in her junior year\u2014causing her to be banned from the team\u2014and her absence hurt her fellow steppers as they went up against other crews. But she and her no-nonsense college counselor Paula Dofat, whose only goal is to make sure that each and every girl has the scholastic and financial means to pursue a higher education, double down on trying to get her GPA off of life support during her final year. On the other end of the scale is Cori Grainger, who is sage beyond her years and determined to maintain her status as class valedictorian, one that she has held since the sixth grade. She is likely to get her pick of universities\u2014Johns Hopkins is at the top of her list. But her devoted mother, Triana, is newly married to her longtime boyfriend and between them they have six children to provide for in their blended family. That means scholarships are a necessity. But Cori never loses hope, noting, \u201cMy mom is like a magic wand in human form.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement Then there is Tayla Solomon, an only child with a drier perspective on life (when it comes to stepping, she says,\u201cI'm like a notch down from Beyonce, because I do still mess up\u201d)\u00a0and is a champion eye-roller thanks to her single helicopter mom, Maisha, who is a big old kid herself. While this correctional officer is dedicated to her job, she also serves as an unofficial den mother to the step team and is more than willing to show them how to do it right. When Tayla\u2019s grades begin to slip after she becomes involved with a male friend, Maisha forbids it, saying, \u201cBoys have cooties. Stay away.\u201d Events beyond the world of academics intrude as well. Lipitz just happened to begin filming in Baltimore in 2015, when Freddie Gray died while in police custody. The racially-charged backdrop adds both urgency and a currency to what happens to these girls. There are shots of inner-city memorials and murals in his honor, and the team\u2019s tough-love-oriented new coach, Gari McIntyre, grew up on the same street as Gray. The theme of \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d informs the choreography of a routine (chants include \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d as well as \u201cI\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud\u201d) that the Lethal Ladies perform in a city-wide warm-up competition to the ultimate event that will include teams from Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., districts. It is all but guaranteed that team members, whose spirits start to flag during their grueling run-throughs, will likely not go away empty-handed. That is especially true after we get a full blast of sisterly swagger when they slo-mo walk, Tarantino-style, down a school hallway to local hip-hop artist Tate Kobang\u2019s \u201cBank Rolls\u201d as they prepare to compete in Bowie, Md. But what is less certain is the fate that awaits Blessin after she is interviewed by two women for a special bridge program that will ease her entrance into the rigors of college.

{"Stars": 0.0, "Title": "Oz the Great and Powerful", "Review": "Just about anyone could have made \"Oz the Great and Powerful,\" a mostly by-the-numbers prequel to Victor Fleming's classic 1939 adaptation of Frank L. Baum's \"The Wizard of Oz.\" The fact that this new \"Oz\" was directed by Sam Raimi, maker of superhero adventures and horror pictures from \"Darkman\" to \"Spider-Man,\" \"The Evil Dead\" to \"Army of Darkness,\" is almost incidental. Raimi's signature touches are mostly tangential flourishes in another otherwise banal origin story, a prequel to one of the most popular Hollywood films of all time. Advertisement You basically know the story of \"Oz\" even if you haven't seen it yet, because the movie encourages viewers to watch characters grow into the roles we already associate them with. And that wouldn't be so bad if screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire didn't focus on annoying sidekicks or a cliched central conflict between James Franco's Wizard and the trio of witches he meets in Oz. Watching our hero fill the clown-sized shoes of prophecy is only as unbearable as its creators' inability to make their tale distinct. But enlivening detail is absent from most of \"Oz the Great and Powerful,\" a film that is largely distinguished by the fact that it's not quite as flavorless as it could have been (especially when compared to Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland,\" which was also produced by Joe Roth). Yet when a film positions itself in the shadow of a beloved fantasy classic, passable isn't good enough. \"Oz\" never goes anywhere you don't expect it to. Since Kapner and Lindsay-Abaire are obsessed with doubling, Oz is both the name of Franco's hero and the land that he travels to. Oscar Diggs is Oz and will soon be the Wizard of it. But when we meet him, Oz is just a carnival magician with dreams of becoming a great man, maybe the next Houdini, or even Edison. He out-and-out tells an old flame that he does not consider himself to be a good man because, as we see, he's a cad whose womanizing schemes are laughably obvious. So when he stumbles into a midwestern twister, Oz pleads to the Higher Powers That Be to give him a second chance and let him prove that he can do better. He gets his wish when he lands in the other Oz and meets Theodora (Mila Kunis), a good witch who assumes Oz must be the \u00a0wizard from a foreign land who's supposed to save Oz from the Wicked Witch. Oz is delighted to be treated like royalty and naturally gets by using basic sleight of hand. But when push comes to shove, and Theodora's imperious sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) sets Oz on the path to killing the Wicked Witch, Oz inevitably finds himself overwhelmed. The film not only looks as unremarkable as Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland,\" but it's entirely populated by threadbare, eager-to-please supporting characters. One performer who's as good as his paltry role is Zach Braff as Finley, a winged monkey in a bellhop's uniform, who's as cloying as Braff's characters normally are. But it's a struggle watching poor Michelle Williams, who plays Glinda the Good Witch, try to make the most out of a juice-less part, cajoling and pouting at Oz with great comic timing. She's so much better than her character, who exists only to motivate Oz, but she never gets much chance to prove it. Advertisement Raimi is the biggest waste of talent here. Though he makes the most out of the Wizard's big showdown with the Wicked Witch, the scene where two witches fight a climactic battle is more representative of the film's shortcomings. You can see Raimi's personality in the witch battle -- the flying antagonists, the ghoulish visage of the vanquished witch at fight's end -- but just barely. A few gags, like when a water fairy spits in Oz's face after singing half of \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" or a sign at a fork in the road that points to both the Dark Forest and Chinatown, hint at a more idiosyncratic take on Baum's world that's never foregrounded. In fact, when Raimi's Munchkins start to sing and dance, you want them to make like Emo Spider-Man in \"Spider-Man 3\" and dance their hearts out. But they don't get to because \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" was apparently made by a committee whose honorary speaker just happens to be the director of \"Drag Me to Hell.\""}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Maggie", "Review": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is very good in this movie. This should not be a surprise. Like his action movie brethren Sly Stallone and Bruce Willis, Schwarzenegger has appeared to coast for decades on a cinematic personae, occasionally doing so in some less-than-satisfying features. However, one tends to forget that Schwarzenegger once worked for director Bob Rafelson and alongside Jeff Bridges and Kirk Douglas. One also forgets that, regardless of the ultimate quality of the features, he was very convincing as a Terminator, a barbarian and a very pregnant man. It is far harder to create something which does not exist, and even harder to command respect for doing so in the supposedly disreputable genres of comedy, fantasy and horror. While Schwarzenegger could never feasibly play The Godfather, he has certainly played that film\u2019s idea: Conan\u2019s enemy-crushing, lamentation-hearing goals are exactly the same as Michael Corleone\u2019s. Advertisement \u201cMaggie\u201d is Schwarzenegger\u2019s \u201cCop Land,\u201d that is, a feature designed to highlight and showcase that which an action movie hero could only hint at in glancing moments between explosions. In \u201cCop Land,\u201d Stallone stripped himself of all the violent artifice that comes with his build, presenting a vulnerability that is hauntingly effective. Schwarzenegger does the same thing here, playing a father who is clearly shaken when driven to violence. Looking unkempt in a scraggly beard, Schwarzenegger\u2019s body language suggests a man who has survived several levels of Hell, yet fears the fresh ones that await him: His character, Wade, is a man who must watch the daughter he has loved and raised slowly wither away and die. That his daughter is dying of some kind of zombie-inducing virus is not the problem that ultimately derails \u201cMaggie\u201d. Director Henry Hobson and screenwriter John Scott 3 are dealing in allegory here. What undoes this film is its unwillingness to be as emotionally brutal as this material requires. The actors are game for the ultimate heart of darkness of its scenario, that of a father possibly having to\u00a0kill his own daughter, yet \u201cMaggie\u201d prefers to hide behind the heavy-handed symbolism of its visuals rather than deal with its tragedy head-on. The ending is an infuriating cop-out, negating the tense crisis build-up the film successfully created. The actors make it easy to play the horror influenced hand \u201cMaggie\u201d deals us. As Wade\u2019s daughter, Maggie, \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine\u201d\u2019s Abigail Breslin brings a welcome realism that shines through even as she starts exhibiting the gruesome signs of her affliction. Her horrified reactions as her body and mind betray her are devastating. As the stronger character in what is essentially a two-hander, she complements Schwarzenegger\u2019s work by giving credence to his parental agony. Hobson also assists by framing Schwarzenegger in scenes where his surroundings dwarf him. \u201cMaggie\u201d takes place out in the country, where Wade tends crops and raises the young family he\u2019s started with Joely Richardson. Hobson shoots these sweeping nature sequences with a heavy emphasis on the symbolic, as if Terrence Malick\u2019s biggest fan were somehow trapped in George Romero\u2019s universe. A sweet looking fox pops up as a stand-in for the loss of innocence. And a shot of Wade holding a torch while standing in front of his burning crops practically begs for some Malickean poetry on the soundtrack. I could hear Schwarzenegger\u2019s voice reciting it, and rather than evoking laughter, I honestly longed for this missed opportunity. Advertisement I feel some guilt in giving a film that tries this hard a negative review. But I couldn\u2019t shake my sense of aggravation at how it all plays out, especially in Schwarzenegger\u2019s case. His character arc is building to the kind of climactic showdown with the enemy you\u2019d expect from one of Ah-nuld\u2019s films, except here the expected violence is imbued with a crushing emotional weight. Had \u201cMaggie\u201d not been so successful in building its foreshadowing tension, it might be easier to dismiss how the ending robs us (and Schwarzenegger) of a final scene of potentially great power. Look at the moment where Wade breaks down after having to murder an infected 4-year old girl. \u201cI used to babysit her,\u201d he says. Hobson clearly has faith in Schwarzenegger\u2019s performance here, letting the moment play out across multiple scenes, including one where Wade\u2019s role is solely reaction shots. As the girl\u2019s mother in this particular scene, Rachel Whitman Groves gets an excellent monologue, her pain serving as a vocal counterpoint to Schwarzenegger\u2019s visual one. Another very good scene finds Richardson\u2019s character, Caroline, ready to do the one thing her husband cannot do. \u201cMaggie\u201d underplays the moment, focusing on a pair of scissors and Caroline\u2019s hesitant reactions to her stepdaughter\u2019s every action. Later, when Caroline confronts Wade, she is empowered by the strength of this prior scene. The audience knows she\u2019s right, and so does Maggie. The only person who hasn\u2019t come around is Wade. Scenes like these lead us to expect that boffo, tremendous scene where Wade confronts his biggest fear, and to his credit, Schwarzenegger is ready to play it. \u201cMaggie\u201d robs him of this chance, keeping him off-screen for an extended period of time, then tacking on that ending which, while tragic, is exceptionally dissatisfying. It\u2019s almost as if all Schwarzenegger\u2019s hard work were undermined by a sudden bout of cold feet by the filmmakers. Despite all the snark that I predict will come regarding its lead actor\u2019s choice to play drama,\u00a0I refuse to blame the filmmakers for their casting choices. Like I said, Arnold Schwarzenegger is very good in this movie. It\u2019s the movie that lets him down. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "Shun Li and the Poet", "Review": "In the lagoon of Venice, remote from the city's famous charms, is an island fishing village named Chioggia. Here, since time immemorial, fisherman set out to feed the city's hunger for scampi and the other creatures trapped in their nets. It is a small community, and many of the regulars hang out at the same taverna. One of these is Bepi, played by the Croatian actor Rade Sherbedgia. You may not recall the name but you will remember the face: 60-ish, weathered, wise. He plays a man facing retirement, who lost his wife a year ago, and is a solitary soul. The bar is owned by Chinese, and one day, a new bartender appears. This is Shun Li (Tao Zhao), in her 30s, divorced, working to pay back the people who paid to bring her from China and to pay for a ticket so her 8-year-old son can join her. Advertisement The customers, like all the regulars in small provincial places, know each other well and don't fail to observe a thing. When a subtle, unstated friendship begins to form between Shun Li and Bepi, they do not approve. They feel somehow threatened, as if this relationship will disturb the fixed pattern of their days. Shun Li and Bepi do not feel passion in the ordinary sense. They have found kindred souls and are linked by their regard for poetry. Bepi's nickname is \u201cPoet,\u201d and Shun Li tells him of China's greatest poet, Qu Yuan, whose birthday is observed every year by floating candles on water. Bepi is from the former Yugoslavia, and even after 30 years in Venice he's still something of an outsider. Both are lonely, and romantics at heart. We learn something of the system that brought Shun Li to Italy, first to a factory in Rome, and now to Chioggia. She essentially works for free to pay off her debt and lives with Lian, another Chinese woman. It is forbidden for her to fraternize with the locals, and when word of her new friendship gets back, as it is sure to do, she is told to have nothing more to do with Bepi. For her this is inarguable; her life centers on being reunited with her son. Venice is the most photogenic city in the world, but we don't see the familiar Venice. Shun Li approaches it by bus across a causeway and sees it as a distant skyline. Yet Chioggia has its own charms, its old stones, its passages between houses, its bridges, its docks, and the small fisherman's huts in the lagoon; Bepe shows this to her. Without ever once kissing, Shun Li tells him she wants to marry him, and he replies, \u201cI know that.\u201d It would not be a marriage of convenience; to prevent just such an event, it is forbidden for a foreigner to pay off a worker's debt. And Bepi's fellow drinkers in the bar \u2014 including one ugly-mannered bully \u2014 begin to exhibit a xenophobic hatred for the Chinese, who will colonize the world, etc. What this all leads to you will discover. Sometimes proper casting does much of the work in a film. For writer-director Andrea Segre, that's the case here. Tao Zhao couldn't speak Italian when she came to make the movie, and that fits the story. Rade Serbedgia as a workingman near the end of a long life, walks steadily across the village's waterfront, wearily smoking as if that's a task he has been set. There is not much happiness in the lives of these two people, but they have each other. Note: Tao Zhao received the best actress prize at Italy's 2012 David di Donatello Awards. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Pompeii", "Review": "This is a surprisingly old-fashioned disaster movie. In point of fact its old-fashioned-ness is really the only surprising thing about this eye-popping 3D spectacle, directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, an adept handler of eye-popping 3D spectacle, as anyone familiar with the \"Resident Evil\" franchise will tell you, and in some areas of film fandom, tell you over and over again.  The destroyed-by-volcanic-eruption-in-ancient-times city of Pompeii is as old and venerated a cinematic subject as Frankenstein\u2019s monster and train robberies. Working from a script by Janet Scott Batchler and Lee Batchler and others (the never-realized Pompeii project that Roman Polanski abandoned a few years back was to be from a Robert Harris novel), Anderson offers up a narrative device older still, a\u00a0 rich-girl/poor-boy variant that finds doe-eyed tycoon\u2019s daughter Cassia (Emily Browning) falling hard for a Britannia-imported slave gladiator known for a while only as \u201cThe Celt,\u201d but later revealed to possess the mighty name of Milo (Kit Harington, so ripped and buff as to make any ordinary man\u2019s resolve to get to the gym more melt into a puddle of futility). Milo\u2019s a bit of a horse whisperer, which helps him get closer to the young lady, who often seems in the vicinity of equine complaints. His more immediate problem is an upcoming arena battle with a noble, promised-to-be-freed fighter named Atticus.\r\nWhile Cassia\u2019s more immediate problem is the Roman Senator Corvus, come to bargain with her father, and determined to make a wife out of Cassia who, in the words of Jean Hagen in \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \u201ccaint staaaaaand him.\u201d  Advertisement Anyway, wouldn\u2019t you know it, but Corvus was also in charge of the Roman battalion that slaughtered Milo\u2019s family many many years ago. That\u2019s the way things work in ancient cities about to get slathered in volcanic ash in movies. Kiefer Sutherland has a hell of a time playing the relentlessly villainous Corvus\u2014you need really strong passions if you\u2019re going to stick to your petty personal grudges even as fireballs are battering all those around you, so it stands to reason. Why Sutherland chose to filter his villainy through Boris Karloff impersonation is anyone\u2019s guess\u2014it\u2019s not as if the kids are gonna get it\u2014but what the heck, I was entertained.  Somewhat less entertaining is the fake-knowingness of the clich\u00e9 dialogue, as when a piggish slave-buyer complains \u201cYou dragged me out of perfectly acceptable brothel for this,\u201d ar ar ar. As much\u00a0 bloodletting as happens in this movie\u2014and there\u2019s quite a bit of it before the volcano action (presaged by a lot of building foundational cracks and such) gets underway\u2014the movie is otherwise\r\nrelentless in its wholesomeness. There\u2019s more real depravity on the screen and in the soul of Cecil B. De Mille\u2019s 1932 \"The Sign of the Cross\" than there is here. However, the action scenes are choice, and once the clouds of ash and shooting fire and churning seas start up, \"Pompeii\" achieves a momentum that most sensationalist studio fare can\u2019t touch. By the end of the movie one senses that Anderson and company were going for a little bit more, particularly in the, you know, profundity department. But the civilians sitting a row ahead of me just giggled at the movie\u2019s final shot, because, well I guess you\u2019ve heard the saying \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be caught dead like that.\u201d Tough crowd!"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Labyrinth of Lies", "Review": "Some time in the first hour of \u201cLabyrinth of Lies,\u201d its lead\r\ncharacter\u2014a young, ambitious, late-'50s German prosecutor named Johann Radmann\u2014begins to learn the scope of the crimes he\u2019s decided to investigate in the\r\nhopes of breaking out of trying traffic violation cases. A former Nazi party\r\nmember has been found to hold a teaching position nearby; this violates German\r\nlaw, although most of the bureaucrats overseeing this sort of thing have been\r\nhappy to look the other way. It emerges that the school employee was a guard at\r\na place called Auschwitz. Although the Nuremberg trials have already taken\r\nplace, German reporting on the international court had apparently been sketchy;\r\nRadmann\u2019s never heard of Auschwitz, and neither have many of his friends and\r\ncolleagues. Advertisement Radmann soon finds out enough, and when doggedly pursues justice, never reflects on whether he might have bitten off more than he can chew.\r\nNeither does the movie itself, directed by Italian-born actor Giulio\r\nRicciarelli, most of whose filmography is German-based. Ricciarelli co-wrote\r\nthe script with Elisabeth Bartel, and while the movie\u2019s lead character is what\r\nthey call a composite, the movie is fact-based, concerning the first\r\nprosecutions of Nazi war criminals within Germany itself. There\u2019s a compelling\r\ncinematic story here, perhaps, but Ricciarelli\u2019s movie is too diffused and\r\nscattered and, especially in its first hour, too reliant on commonplaces.\r\nRadmann, played by the handsome but rather stiff Alexander Fehling, is an\r\nalmost too-good-to-be-true fiction, the guy who stands in the hallway in an\r\noverhead shot while the rest of his colleagues are going to their offices, and\r\nthen retrieves from a wastepaper basket a document about that Nazi \u201ccase\u201d that\r\nnone of his fellows want to touch with a ten-foot-pole. He collaborates with a\r\nfiery, feisty German journalist named Gnielka (Andr\u00e9 Szymanski) who introduces\r\nhim to the world of postwar, pre-counterculture Euro bohemia, and these scenes\r\nhave a certain charm. But crusaders, victims, and perpetrators are all painted\r\nwith the standard contemporary brush; the bad guys have just enough banality of\r\nevil, the survivors have the clich\u00e9d mix of defeated slouch and stiff spines,\r\nand so on. It\u2019s rather tiresome, with the bonus of making the viewer feel bad\r\nabout finding it tiresome. Which means, finally, that it\u2019s a betrayal of the\r\nreality it\u2019s trying to portray, and one would be better of re-viewing \u201cShoah\u201d\r\nagain. Radmann becomes obsessed with tracking down one particularly\r\nheinous Auschwitz denizen, one Dr. Josef Mengele. If you don\u2019t know how that\r\npursuit turns/turned out, well I won\u2019t \u201cspoil\u201d it for you\u2026but by the same\r\ntoken, you should be ashamed of yourself. As Radmann goes off on his own\r\ntangents, his boss, the Attorney General Bauer (Gert Voss) tries to straighten\r\nhis focus, working an agenda of his own.  As the movie progresses, story themes emerge that are more\r\nactively interesting, although they\u2019re not explored with any particular\r\nartistry. The deeper Radmann digs, the more Nazis he finds. Pursuing a line\r\nfleshed out in the controversial history account \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing\r\nExecutioners,\u201d Radmann discovers that no one is innocent, not even those he\r\nonce most admired. This proves tough to him to handle. There\u2019s a potentially\r\nsearing psychological drama in this kind of stuff, and while Ricciarelli does\r\nuse the material to underscore an object lesson on what the true nature of\r\ninvestigation and justice ought to be, he doesn\u2019t take any meaningful artistic\r\nadvantage of the material. So the movie winds up being\u2014to put it kindly\u2014mildly\r\nintellectually satisfying while entirely emotionally flat. In an interesting\r\nside note, an American Army officer who oversees wartime archives, and\r\nreluctantly (at first) assists Radmann in his research, is played by one Tim\r\nWilliams, whom American viewers may recognize as the somewhat smarmy dude in\r\nthe ads for travel-discount website Trivago. He\u2019s sarcastic but not\r\nparticularly creepy here and he speaks excellent German, for what it\u2019s worth."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Thin Ice", "Review": "There's an explanation of the plot at the end of \"Thin Ice,\" including flashbacks to key moments and shots explaining otherwise inexplicable matters. This explanation essentially builds a different movie out of the one we thought we just saw, and rather makes us want to see it again knowing what we now know. That's not complete consolation. \"Thin Ice\" could have been more coherent in the first place.  An ordinary life supplies room for only so many twists and turns. The life of Mickey Prohaska (Greg Kinnear) is all too commodious. He's an insurance salesman in Kenosha, Wis., who drives a flashy Cadillac but is deep in debt and estranged from the wife (Lea Thompson) he expropriated money from. Since the insurance business requires much use of the telephone, he finds it dispiriting that most of his calls come from bill collectors. Advertisement We meet Mickey at an insurance convention where he lectures on how to strike up conversations. (Question to Mickey: How much do you charge for supplying audiences with such conversation openers as, \"Do you have the correct time?\") After his speech, trying out his own line in the hotel bar, he falls for a con so old that Nancy was pulling it on Sluggo. Back in Kenosha, he calls on a possible client, a farmer named Gorvy Hauer, played by Alan Arkin as a man wandering in the fog of his own befuddlement. Gorvy needs insurance on his TV so he can call a guy to get it to work; Mickey observes that it's not plugged in, but signs him up anyway for a high-priced package. He assures Gorvy his house looks like it's worth $400,000; it looks to me as it had been stapled together from a house trailer and a couple of prefabricated sunrooms. While he's at the house, a violin appraiser (Bob Balaban) calls to offer Gorvy $25,000 for an old family violin. Mickey, a heartless bastard, immediately decides to steal the violin and sell it himself. Already we're seeing some good typecasting at work. Kinnear is a likable actor, who possibly would make a trustworthy insurance salesman. As his problems begin to pile up, however, he could have used a greater ability to vibrate in terror. William H. Macy, as the car salesman in \"Fargo,\" comes to mind. Indeed, a lot of \"Fargo\" comes to mind in the snowbound Wisconsin locations of \"Thin Ice.\" Arkin has always has a good line in confused naivete. His Gorvy is so hapless, and yet with such occasional streaks of insight, that we don't know if his stupidity or his intelligence is an act, but we suspect one or the other is. Balaban evokes a man who knows everything about violins, including a lot he isn't sharing. His violin shop looks remarkably authentic, even though it occupies an upper floor of an industrial building. Now enters the engine of the movie's energy, an installer of security systems. This is Randy (Billy Crudup), a man with a police record who isn't above stealing the odd alarm clock. This would be the last man you'd want in charge of your security, but how is old Gorvy expected to know that? Mickey, who can resist anything but temptation, seems to have found a partner in crime. More of the plot I must not describe. This is a devilishly ingenious screenplay by the sisters Jill and Karen Sprecher. Jill directed, and they shared the same credits on two wonderful films, \"Clockwatchers\" (1997) and \"Thirteen Conversations About One Thing\" (2001). The plot construction of \"Thin Ice\" must have taken a great deal of effort, and I feel churlish in raising a couple of points: (1) As these things are happening to Mickey Prohaska, there comes a point \u2014 perhaps when the guy was being pounded on the head with a hammer \u2014 when they're rather over the top; (2) the explanation, when it comes, cannot be said to fall into place with a smoothly oiled click, but feels more like an alibi. Advertisement Never mind. As it is actually happening, \"Thin Ice\" kept me interested and entertained. There's nothing like the macabre to bring intrigue to an ordinary life, and nothing like the logistics of body disposal to challenge an insurance salesman. The acting helps to float the movie. These actors are quirky in complementary ways, and I've never seen Crudup anywhere near this weirded out. My objections are more like technical fouls.  Footnote: This review was written before I received a letter from Jill Sprecher, which may explain my problems with the film: \"The producers and distributor of our film completely re-edited it without me. Nearly 20 minutes were cut; the structure rearranged; out-takes used; voiceover and characters dropped; key plot points omitted; a new score added. Although our names contractually remain on the film, my sister and I do not consider 'Thin Ice' to be our work.\" I showed Jill and Karen's \"Thirteen Conversations About One Thing\" at Ebertfest 2003. I loved their \"Clockwatchers.\" They know film construction. This explanation seems to account for the questions I raised."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "The Fourth Kind", "Review": "Boy, is the Nome, Alaska, Chamber of Commerce going to be pissed off when it sees \"The Fourth Kind.\" You don't wanna go there. You can't drive there, that's for sure. The only ways in are by sea, air, dogsled or birth canal. Why the aliens chose this community of 9,261 to abduct so many people is a mystery. Also why owls stare into bedroom windows. Nome has been the center of an alarming series of strange disappearances, we learn. So many, the FBI has sent agents there 10 times more than to the much bigger Anchorage. \"The Fourth Kind\" is based on the testimony of a psychologist who found, circa 2000, that many of her patients reported waking at 3 a.m. with the sense that something was wrong and seeing an owl with its eyes on them. Advertisement The film goes to great lengths to be realistic. \"I am the actress Milla Jovovich,\" Jovovich tells us at the outset, explaining that in the film she plays the psychologist Abigail Tyler, whose testimony was videotaped. Other fact-based characters are her colleague (Elias Koteas), the local sheriff (Will Patton) and a professor who interviews her (Olatunde Osunsanmi). \"Every scene in this movie is supported by archived footage,\" she says, and to prove it, Osunsanmi, who's also the director, uses split screen to show Jovovich and the real Abigail talking almost simultaneously. The real psychologist's name has been changed, but since she's right there on the screen, how much of a mystery can she be in Nome? It was with crushing disappointment that my research discovered this is all made up out of whole cloth, including the real Abigail. The film wasn't even shot in Nome, but mostly in Bulgaria. And Dallas Massie, a retired state trooper who's the acting police chief in Nome, says he's heard nothing about aliens. I learn all this from the blog of an Anchorage Daily News reporter, Kyle Hopkins, who says about 20 people have indeed disappeared in the area since the 1960s, and writes: \"The FBI stepped in, reviewing two dozen cases, eventually determining that excessive alcohol consumption and the winter climate were a common link in many of the cases. Some of the dead were killed by exposure or from falling off a jetty into the frigid Snake River.\" All right, then, \"The Fourth Kind\" is a pseudo-documentary like \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\" But unlike those two, which just forge ahead with their home video cameras, this one encumbers its flow with ceaseless reminders that it is a dramatization of real events. When we see Will Patton, for example, a subtitle informs us: \"Will Patton, actor.\" Oh! I already know well that Will Patton and Elias Koteas are actors, and Jovovich identifies herself at the start. I wish they'd had gotten a really big-name star. It might have been funny to read, \"Bruce Willis: Actor.\" Advertisement Now here's a good question. In the film we see the \"real\" footage of \"actual\" client interviews with \"Abigail.\" Why would an real psychologist release confidential videotapes to a horror film, especially tapes showing her clients having seizures? Who are those \"actual clients,\" really? The end credits don't thank them, although Jovovich's intro claims to explain them. Remember, even in a movie \"based on a true story\" (like \"Fargo\"), nothing before the actual end credits needs to be true. You want to watch those credits like a hawk. My theory is, the \"actual\" clients are played by the actors also playing their fictional versions. I can't be sure of that. Think about it. Jovovich is good, actually. It's a broad melodramatic role with lots of screaming, and after two \"Resident Evil\" movies, she's good at being an endangered heroine, and makes a competent psychologist. And a successful one, too. Her log-cabin Arts & Crafts office looks like it was surely subleased from a (Bulgarian) millionaire. We see there's a lot of business in Nome for a specialist in owl-staring."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "My Blind Brother", "Review": "Bill (Nick Kroll) has been overshadowed by his brother Robbie (Adam Scott) since a childhood accident resulted in Robbie becoming blind. Robbie took his disability as a motivation to prove that he could rise above it. Bill has been supporting his brother's efforts, which involve displays of physical endurance to raise money for a charitable organization for the blind. In the process, Robbie has become a local hero, while Bill works at a dead-end job at a printing shop when he isn't helping his brother train for the next event. Advertisement Lest the setup of \"My Blind Brother\" begin to sound too inspiring in terms of overcoming physical limitations and sacrificing one's own desires for a loved one, it must be pointed out that neither Bill nor Robbie particularly seem to like each other. Bill hates to exert himself physically. He also resents that Robbie uses him as something akin to a guide dog and that no one seems to notice his role in Robbie's efforts. As for the brother's feelings toward Bill, Robbie gives a big speech after a marathon-length run. He builds up to thanking the one individual who has been with him through it all\u2014the voice in his ear telling him to keep going. That's when he acknowledges the big guy upstairs. The wording of the build-up seems to take Robbie's omission beyond forgetfulness or ignorance and into the realm of intentional slight. Writer/director Sophie Goodhart opens the film (her first feature, based on her short) on these specific notes of conflict. That turns out to be vital to the success of the film, which quickly becomes a situational comedy about a scenario in which a little bit of honesty from any of the involved characters probably would resolve the plot in an instant. Even the brief time Goodhart spends with these characters before the beginning of the plot's conflict is enough to establish the reason that such a quick, simple resolution is impossible for these people. They are inclined to lie\u2014to each other, in order to keep their relationships relatively nice and calm, and to themselves, in order to keep up the other lies. These lies aren't malicious. These are fairly decent people, and they lie because they want to stay decent\u2014or at least to keep up the appearance of being good people. The plot involves a romantic triangle of sorts, although it's probable that there are no romantic feelings on the part of Rose (Jenny Slate), the woman who becomes involved with both brothers within a short span of time. She meets Bill at a bar where there's a memorial for her late boyfriend, who was hit by a bus while running after her. He was running because she had just dumped him, and Rose blames herself for the guy's untimely demise. She and Bill have a one-night stand. He wants more, but she turns him down, saying that any relationship she might have now would be doomed. Advertisement Feeling a need to make up for \"killing\" her boyfriend, Rose volunteers to help Robbie prepare for a swim across a lake for charity. Robbie misinterprets Rose's helpfulness as something more. When she corrects him, he's embarrassed, and wanting to save him from that embarrassment, Rose kisses him. The two start dating. Bill, of course, now has another reason to be jealous of his brother. The comedy here goes deeper than the awkward situation or the ways in which Bill and Rose try to hide their recent entanglement from Robbie. Goodhart allows her characters to be a bit pathetic, to possess some despair, and to have qualities that don't exactly endear them to us. Bill is lazy and unmotivated, and whatever drive he has left revolves around his need to one-up his brother. The joke is that there's no way he can win. Robbie is an inspiration because he is everything that Bill isn't. Bill won't call out his brother for his negative qualities because he doesn't want to be the guy who would shame his blind brother (There's also some guilt on Bill's part, hinted at early in the film and made explicit by the end). Bill's only recourse is to offer immature, sarcastic snipes when nobody is paying attention to him (which is often). Rose has a co-dependent streak. Her entire sense of self-worth is based on what other people think of her. When the parents of her dead boyfriend run into her and Robbie at a restaurant, she finds herself trying to apologize for how she has started dating again, and then she has to apologize to Robbie for the other apology. In a rather daring turn, Goodhart makes Robbie the most irksome of the bunch. He's spoiled, self-absorbed, and superficial. He worries that Rose doesn't live up to his standards of physical appearance, and at one point, Bill nearly sabotages his brother's romance by lying that Rose has an unsightly birthmark on her cheek. There's an occasional sense that Goodhart has tipped the scales against Robbie on the personality front, if only to justify a few jokes that depend on his disability and, mainly, to excuse Bill for what happens during the climactic swim. Scott's performance leans perhaps a bit too heavily toward Robbie's jerk side, although, as written, there isn't much more to the character. Kroll and Slate, though, give performances that have the opposite effect. They aren't the best people, but the relative goodness of their intentions is never in doubt. \"My Blind Brother\" puts these characters through the comic wringer, but the humor is founded on the characters and their flaws, not the circumstances.

{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "G.I. Joe: Retaliation", "Review": "Seeing as how \"G.I. Joe: Retaliation\" is a live-action cartoon, I wish we could have seen thought balloons above the heads of Channing Tatum, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Bruce Willis, among others, as they filmed this ridiculous and overblown debacle. Not their characters, mind you. I wanted to see thought balloons indicating what was going through the minds of the actors as they went through their paces: Willis: \"Let's see, this paycheck will cover the vacation house for what, another two years; plus, I can get a gold harmonica. Hey, I wonder if any of these punks saw the original 'Die Hard'? Wait, they want me to say WHAT about Patton's gun? Jesus\u2026\" Advertisement Johnson: \"I know they're going to turn this scene into a slow-motion group-walk in the editing. How many times am I going to have to walk in slow motion with flames bursting all around me? Am I going to do be doing this when I'm 70?\" Tatum: \"I've got to talk to my agent about these 'must appear in the sequel' contracts.\" Adrianne Palicki: \"Hey everybody, remember me? I was on 'Friday Night Lights'! That show had actual writing!\" To say \"G.I. Joe: Retaliation\" is a video game for the big screen is to insult a number of video games that are far more creative, challenging and better-looking. Like a Dumpster bin behind Tiffany's, this contains nothing but well-packaged garbage. In the tradition of \"Transformers\" (just kidding about the \"tradition\" part), this franchise is of course based on a collection of toys, so it's not as if we're expecting \"Zero Dark Thirty.\" The first installment, \"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\" (2009), at least had a sense of its own absurdity, but the sequel is a heavy-handed, explosion-riddled, ear-piercing disaster with an insanely stupid plot and an endless stream of mostly generic fight sequences that straddle the PG-13 line. Sure, there are all kinds of cool toys and breathtaking mountain-side fight sequences and guns-and-against swords nonsense, but they're all so clearly fake, so clearly concocted in the CGI lab, that we're bored when we should be saying, \"holy bleep.\" We pick up the action in \"Retaliation\" with some generic buddy-movie bonding between Duke (Channing Tatum) and Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson). They engage in semi-witty banter while taking out the enemy, playing video games or hanging with Roadblock's family. OK, not bad. But soon the playing field gets crowded, with Flint (D.J. Cotrona), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Snake Eyes (Ray Park) going up against the Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow and Firefly. I'm sorry, but if you're older than 12 and/or not involved in a serious nostalgia trip, how can you take any of this stuff seriously? Advertisement The dialogue and exposition scenes in \"G.I. Joe\" are like something out of a Saturday morning cartoon from the 1980s, but the PG-13 violence is a little intense for the 7-year-old boys (and girls) who might love this stuff. The end game here is we have a villain who says he \"wants it all,\" meaning control of the world, but as is so often the case with these bad guys, first he wants to blow up much of the world, which always has me wondering: Why does Mr. Evil Bad Guy want to rule over a vast, nuclear-poisoned wasteland? Where's the fun in that? Full disclosure here: I did not play with G.I. Joe action figures when I was a kid. Even at 10 years old, I thought that the whole \"G.I. Joe, G.I. Joe, fighting man from head to toe\" thing was just a goofy way of selling dolls to boys. Nor was I fan of the various \"G.I. Joe\" comic book series through the years  \u2014 and yes, that means I'm not versed in the Marvel Comics that ran in the 1980s or the more recent series that have their fanboy bases. I can promise you when this review and the video versions are published, the comments on the websites of the Sun-Times and Roger Ebert and YouTube and a dozen other places will be more entertaining than the movie itself. To which I say: good for you. It's important to be passionate about something. But here's the thing: I'm reviewing the movie. The issue is not whether the movie is ever so faithful to the comic strip or whether it will satisfy the hardcore fans. And as a stand-alone film, from the characters to the alleged humor to the plot to the action sequences to the twists and turns, this movie \u2026 what's the word? Sucks."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Strength and Honor", "Review": "Within the first five minutes, we know precisely how \"Strength and Honor\" is going to end. The rest is in the details, which are sometimes pretty good. The movie is about a boxer named Sean Kelleher who retires forever from the ring after killing his brother-in-law in a sparring match and only returns to win the money for a $250,000 heart operation for his young son. Wait, we're not finished yet. How could he win so much money for his first bout? Because he is fighting bare-knuckled for the title of King of the Travelers (also known as gypsies). Advertisement His arch foe in the championship bout is the vicious, mean, hard man named Smasher O'Driscoll, played by the British soccer star Vinnie Jones, but what do you think the odds are that he will lose his fight and his son will die? I should explain that this all takes place in County Cork, and stars Michael Madsen, who is a good deal gentler and more loving than you may remember him from \"Kill Bill,\u00a0Volume 1\".  The movie is much about the travelers on a hilltop outside town. Sean is not a traveler, but after his wife dies and he is forced to sell their house to pay medical bills, he buys a caravan and moves in next door to the earth mother Mammy (Gail Fitzpatrick), whose son Chaser (Michael Rawley) lives nearby and begins to think of Sean as a father figure. Sean's financial crisis in the movie, by the way, should be reported to Michael Moore; Irish medical care seems mighty expensive.  This is melodrama mixed with formula and a great deal of tear-jerking, but Madsen plays the character straight down the center and has considerable authority; he doesn't ask for sympathy, doesn't accept favors lightly, says nothing when the travelers accept his $10,000 deposit on the prizefight, pocket the money, and tell him he's not qualified because he's not of the blood. He needs the $250,000 too much to complain. This and other matters are settled among the gypsies around a small bonfire, which provides warm, flickering light for many a conversation. Eventually he's allowed to fight, and in the final bout faces the fearsome, animalistic Smasher, who knocks out people just for knocking at his door.  Sharp eyes among you are wondering how they have dollars in Ireland. They do not. They had the Irish pound (in Gaelic, the punt) until they switched to Euros in 2002. Why nobody in the film knows this is a mystery; less so perhaps with Sean, who is an American who moved to Cork with his Irish wife.  There is some nice character work in the movie. Richard Chamberlain plays the manager of a boxing gym and Sean's manager and advisor. Michael Rawley is persuasive as the young acolyte. And Gail Fitzpatrick steals scenes with the sheer ferocity of her passion for justice; it's pretty clear that she and her neighbor Sean may be linking up in a double-wide before long. Advertisement  But the movie, written and directed by first-timer Mark Mahon, follows so resolutely in the footsteps so many many other sporting movies that we're way ahead of the story arc. One novelty is the violence of the bare-knuckle fights, which take place within a ring of savagely shouting men, although it's a puzzle why the prize fight is the less well-attended than the opening bouts. If you want to see a predictable boxing movie with a kinder, gentler Michael Madsen who's really quite convincing, here's your movie. But I'd like to see this side of Madsen developed in a better screenplay."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Title": "Donald Cried", "Review": "\u201cDonald Cried\u201d is the micro-budget version of a studio man-child comedy, in which an uptight man closely interacts with a free-spirited friend\u2014both of them immature. Low-key shenanigans, like goofy conversations with a couple of odd revelations, ensue. What this movie adds to the arrested development film is a reliance on dialogue, a withholding of large comic set pieces, and a strange title character. But for a movie that seemingly wants a pat on the back for doing things slightly different, it never feels like more than a malnourished Adam McKay movie that lacks even in laughs.\u00a0 Advertisement Jesse Wakeman, a co-writer on the project, plays the type of slightly condescending, selfish jerk that Hollywood would dump onto Robert Downey Jr. or a poorly-cast Paul Rudd, venturing back to his Rhode Island hometown to take care of some family business after his grandmother passes. The movie starts with the cringe it so desires in an assuredly unpleasant but cheap way, as his bland, pea-coat and scarf-wearing character (who lost his wallet on the bus) acts too busy for a real estate agent trying to assess his late grandmother\u2019s property, and then asks a friend on the phone to wire him 200 bucks. Outside, he soon runs into his high school friend Donald, who still lives at home, and asks him for money and a ride to the funeral home. Played by co-writer/director Kris Avedisian, Donald is the one flavor to stand out in this venture, a tall, boyishly-excited dude with a baritone voice and a greasy mullet who talks about the past like how people excitedly recount action movies. He's a full-force inventor of awkwardness, the way he doesn\u2019t understand social boundaries (like in a cliche gag where he nonchalantly disrobes while uptight Peter is looking at him) or goes on a rant about how Peter's banking job would be perfect for a future heist. But these characteristics are pitched by the script in such an extreme way, meant to force the awkwardness and test the audience's sympathy, that he lacks the base of recognition of which his cartoonish nature could then grow from. Instead, he's more familiar to other fictional characters, offering the expected subtext of sadness while smiling with his huge grin and big, tragic eyes.\u00a0 The story, of which there is not much, focuses on Donald forcing Peter to hang out, often at Peter's reluctance (even though Peter keeps asking for money, or a ride). Ultimately, \"Donald Cried\" remains character-based on these tough-sell fictional beings, observing how things have and have not changed for them. Allusions are made in select dialogue about the past, regarding the stuff they did as metal-heads, and the dead parents in their histories. In particular, Donald proves to have a fascination with Peter, to the point of possible obsession. This last facet might be a sustainably weird element if the story wasn't so laid-back with the bigger picture.\u00a0 Advertisement Even if this were the first, or 50th, movie about the man-child, \u201cDonald Cried\u201d still doesn\u2019t have the vision to make a strong statement. The location of a cloudy, snowy Rhode Island day is a great choice, and there are a couple of inspired visual ideas, like how Donald (in a colorful bathrobe) is introduced by sharing the frame with a garbage can. But there\u2019s an air of sloppiness to this project, the way it often has a blown-out look, or that extended takes of them talking inside Donald's van or in the snow seem less motivated by striking visuals than economizing serviceable performances. This is the kind of production where the lead actor\u2019s name is spelled incorrectly in the casting credits, as the ending scroll here reads \u201cAvesidian.\u201d\u00a0 There is something in here about male aggression and sadness, in the way that Peter will engage in rough-housing with the friend he rejects when pushed to like when they wrestle in the snow, or that Donald claims he \u201clives for\u201d his stepfather beating him up and emasculating him. But in the true spirit of this profoundly uninteresting movie, \u201cDonald Cried\u201d can only shrug through its central notion that men will be sad boys."}

Throughout the raucous,\r\ndrug-fueled comedy, Rogen\u2019s character and his best friends speak repeatedly of\r\nthis being the last such bash. It made me wonder if Rogen wasn\u2019t heading off\r\ncriticism of repetition in the past\u2014yes, we\u2019ve thrown this party before in films like \u201cKnocked\r\nUp,\u201d \u201cThis is the End\u201d and \u201cNeighbors\u201d but this is really the last time. Whether or not that\u2019s the\r\ncase, \u201cThe Night Before\u201d is a well-intentioned comedy with some big laughs and\r\nsome big misfires, but it ultimately works because Rogen and his well-cast\r\nbuddies ground it in a way that makes them likable. A killer Michael Shannon\r\nsupporting performance never hurts either. Advertisement \u201cThe Night Before\u201d opens with a literal Christmas tale\r\nstorybook animation, narrated by Tracy Morgan in a way only he can. We learn of\r\nthree best friends\u2014Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Isaac (Seth Rogen) and Chris\r\n(Anthony Mackie)\u2014who have been spending Christmas Eve together for over a\r\ndecade, since Ethan lost his parents, doing their best to have as much fun as\r\npossible acting mostly like idiots. Blowing up snowmen, getting high and going\r\nto look at the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, singing \u201cChristmas in\r\nHollis\u201d at karaoke\u2014they\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make this holiday more memorable\r\nthan the last, recognizing that emotions run high at the holidays and trying to\r\nkeep Ethan positive.  The annual event is straining under the reality of\r\nadulthood. Isaac has a loving wife (Jillian Bell), who is well into her third\r\ntrimester. He\u2019s about to be a father for the first time\u2014there can be no more holiday\r\ndebauchery. Chris is dealing with a different issue altogether, having a\r\nbreakthrough season on the football field, although he\u2019s been using steroids to\r\ndo so, recognizing that a 34-year-old athlete is past his prime. He also seems\r\nmore concerned with his social media following than his real life. Meanwhile,\r\nEthan is recently split from Diana (Lizzy Caplan), a girl who finally showed\r\nhim the door after he kept refusing to meet her parents. He not-so-secretly\r\nwants her back. Two events define the trajectory of \u201cThe Night Before\u201d\u2014Ethan\r\nstumbles upon tickets to a legendary NYC holiday party known as \u201cThe Nutcracker\r\nBall,\u201d while Isaac\u2019s wife gives him a box of drugs to enhance the evening\u2019s\r\ninsanity. As the boys pre-game for the big party to come\r\nlater that night, Isaac gets deeply messed up, allowing Rogen to display some\r\ntruly bad behavior as he mixes mushrooms, Molly, coke, weed and more from his\r\nbox of goodies. Meanwhile, Chris tries to buy some pot to impress the star\r\nquarterback on his team, leading the gang to Mr. Green (Michael Shannon), the\r\nsame dealer they bought from back in high school. Comedy Central stars Ilana\r\nGlazer (\u201cBroad City\u201d) and Nathan Fielder (\u201cNathan For You\u201d) pop up in cameos,\r\nand Miley Cyrus appears late in the piece in a very funny scene to remind us\r\nall that \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d is a perfect pop song. Advertisement Several of the \u201cbits\u201d within \u201cThe Night Before\u201d fall\r\nsurprisingly flat. Mindy Kaling is wasted as Diana\u2019s best friend, and a scene\r\nin which Isaac\u2019s nose drips \u201ccocaine blood\u201d into her drink is horribly unfunny.\r\nAnother scene late in the piece in which Ethan picks a fight with a couple of\r\ndrunk guys dressed as Santa Claus also simply doesn\u2019t work. One wonders if the\r\npiece didn\u2019t need another rewrite, or if Levine, who has shown solid dramatic\r\nchops with \u201c50/50,\u201d was the right fit for this kind of \u201cwacky adventure.\u201d He\r\ndoesn\u2019t always nail the comedic balance, especially as the piece gets deeper in\r\nits characterizations and we\u2019re still supposed to believe these guys are dumb\r\nenough to try and steal a horse-drawn carriage (another disastrously unfunny\r\nbit). If you\u2019re keeping a ledger, and some of you probably are, \u201cThe Night\r\nBefore\u201d has more scenes that simply don\u2019t work compared to \u201cThis is the End\u201d or \u201cNeighbors.\u201d However, and this is a big however, it has a great cast.\r\nGordon-Levitt and Mackie bring gravity to their roles that would otherwise be\r\nmissing with lesser, pure comedy actors in the roles. Caplan and Gordon-Levitt have honest chemistry, and\r\nLevine seems more invested in their arc than most directors would be. We want\r\nto see these characters happy, and that matters more than you might think. They're not merely joke mouthpieces like in a Happy Madison flick. They're real people played by excellent actors. Their narrative quest for comfort under the\r\nChristmas tree doesn\u2019t feel like the clich\u00e9 that it otherwise would because\r\nLevine and his trio of actors invest in it completely. And Michael Shannon\r\nsteals every scene he\u2019s in as the wisest pot dealer in the Big Apple. \u201cThe Night Before\u201d has enough bad jokes to at times make you wonder\r\nif Rogen shouldn\u2019t have matured out of this subgenre one movie earlier. However, it ends strong. The last half-hour is the best in the film, as\r\nwe\u2019ve come to know and like these characters, and the writers are done wasting\r\ntime to get to the big jokes and emotional realizations we\u2019ve all been waiting\r\nfor. In the end, it\u2019s not the lowlights of those \u201ccrazy nights\u201d of our life\r\nthat we remember, and \u201cThe Night Before\u201d has enough highlights to make it a\r\nfitting final holiday bash.

{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "The Descendants", "Review": "\"The Descendants\" has a happy ending. Therefore, technically, it's a comedy. It takes place in the paradise of Hawaii. It stars George Clooney. That may lead you to expect a pleasant good time, but this film is so much more than that. Clooney gives one of his best performances in this film directed and co-written by Alexander Payne, who in \"Sideways\" (2004) and \"About Schmidt\" (2002), showed a special affinity for men learning to accept their better feelings. The state of Hawaii is a co-star. I've been there many times, which only qualifies me as a tourist, but at more than 20 Hawaii Film Festivals, I met so many people and went to so many places that I began to understand how its people feel a love and protectiveness for the land, and how seriously they take its traditions. Much of the story here is about how Matt King (Clooney), a descendant of one of Hawaii's first white land-owning families, must decide whether to open up a vast tract of virgin forest on Kauai to tourist and condo development. At the same time, he faces a personal crisis.  Advertisement The film opens with his thrill-loving wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) in a boating accident off Waikiki Beach. Matt has been involved in land management; he holds the controlling share of his extended family's estate. Elizabeth has run their own family, raising their daughters: the teenager Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and the younger Scottie (Amara Miller). Now Elizabeth is in a coma, and her living will instructs Matt to remove life support. Alexandra returns home from boarding school, and Matt becomes a single parent while also dealing with the King family's urgent desire to close the multi-million-dollar land deal. This is big business, emotional and financial. Just because the lawyers wear short-sleeved Reyn Spooner shirts doesn't make them pushovers. Matt's life is further complicated when he discovers from an unexpected source that his wife had been having an affair. And his daughters don't want him to sell the land, where they must often have wandered as children. Leading the push for the King family is Cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges). Hugh, who is as affable as Bridges can be, doesn't want to listen to any woo-hoo nonsense about not selling. The story is based on a novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, the daughter of a famous surfer and politician. Reading her bio, I suspect that there must be a lot of her in Alexandra and Scottie. Matt King himself thinks he will probably sell, but now everything is in upheaval. An undercurrent, which Payne wisely keeps subtle, is that perhaps Matt lost touch with his wife and daughters after first losing his special bond to the land. Payne's films are usually about people forced into difficult personal decisions. Do you remember Laura Dern in \"Citizen Ruth\" (1996)? He always carefully establishes his lead characters in a matrix of supporting characters who are given weight and complexity, so we feel the pressures they're experiencing. Here there is Scott Thorson (Robert Forster), his father-in-law, a flinty, self-confident man who perhaps always has had doubts about Matt. Also, there are the man Elizabeth was having the affair with, Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) and \u2014 here it gets thorny \u2014 Brian's wife, Julie (Judy Greer). Advertisement The film follows Matt's legal, family and emotional troubles in careful detail, until Payne shows us, without forcing it, that they are all coiled together. A solution for one must be a solution for all. This is so much more complex than most movie plots, where good and evil are neatly compartmented and can be sorted out at the end. Payne is gifted at using the essence of an actor. He links something in their nature to their characters. Consider Robert Forster, handsome, tanned, angry in a complex way about his daughter's imminent death because she might not have been in the boat if Matt had been a better husband. Mr. Thorson has a moment of stunning truth with Sid (Nick Krause), the seemingly spaced-out boyfriend of Alexandra; Sid is also not as simple as he seems. Consider Matthew Lillard as the adulterer; not a bad man. Consider Beau Bridges, who is reluctant to be the bad guy, but not unwilling. What happens is that we get vested in the lives of these characters. That's rare in a lot of movies. We come to understand how they think and care about what they decide. There are substantial moral problems underlying the plot. And George Clooney? What essence does Payne see in him? I believe it is intelligence. Some actors may not be smart enough to sound convincing; the wrong actor in this role couldn't convince us that he understands the issues involved. Clooney strikes me as manifestly the kind of actor who does. We see him thinking, we share his thoughts, and at the end of \"The Descendants,\" we've all come to his conclusions together."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "Hell Ride", "Review": "I read an article the other day saying the average age of motorcyclists is going up. Judging by \"Hell Ride,\" the average age of motorcycle gang members is approaching the Medicare generation, not that many will survive to collect the benefits. Some of the movie's \"plot\" involves revenge for the torching of the girlfriend of the gang president. That took place in the bicentennial year of 1976, which was, let's see, 32 years ago. By the time they kill the guy who did it, he's a geezer with so many chin whiskers they can barely cut his throat. Advertisement The movie was written and produced by Larry Bishop, who also stars as Pistolero, president of an outlaw club named the Victors. Bishop starred in a motorcycle movie named \"The Savage Seven\" in 1968, which was, let's see, 40 years ago. He was also in \"The Devil's 8,\" \"Angels Unchained\" and \"Chrome and Hot Leather.\" It's a wonder he doesn't have a handicapped placard for his hog. In between searching for a killer, he leads a gang whose members are sort of hard to tell apart, except for The Gent (Michael Madsen), so-called because instead of leathers, he wears a ruffled formal shirt under a tux jacket, with his gang colors stitched on the back. Why does he do that? The answer to that question would require Character Development, and none of the cast members develop at all. They spring into being fully created and never change, like Greek gods. There are cameo roles for two icons of biker movies, Dennis Hopper and David Carradine, who play old-timers -- i.e., contemporaries of the other gang members. Madsen, at nearly 50, may be the youngest cast member and also brings along expertise in doing the Walk. That would be the scene made famous from \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) and a zillion other movies where three or four tough guys lope along in unison away from something is that is about to blow up and don't flinch when it does. Wait a minute. Maybe the guy who gets blown up killed Comanche and not the grizzled old-timer. I dunno. The enemy gang of the Victors are the 666ers, but I couldn't tell them apart, except for the closeups of the colors on their backs, which had the disadvantage of not showing their faces. There is a character named Deuce, but I don't know why. Or maybe he is a gang. The movie was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino. Shame on him. He intends it no doubt as another homage to grindhouse pictures, but I've seen a lot of them, and they were nowhere near this bad. \"Hell's Angels on Wheels,\" for example: pretty good. All these guys do is shoot one another and roll around in bars with naked girls with silicone breasts -- who don't seem to object to the biker's smelly grime. The girls look about 25, tops, but the only reference to age in the movie is when a biker names his bike after the horse Trigger, and is asked, \"How old is Trigger in horse-bike years?\" Quick -- whose horse was Trigger? Can anyone under 25 answer? OK, then: Silver? Champion? Topper? Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "Terminator 2: Judgment Day 3D", "Review": "While\u00a0\"The Terminator\" was a great horror film, \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" is a great action film. While\u00a0\"The Terminator\" was about the horror of an unstoppable harbinger of a technologically-advanced but soul-dead present,\u00a0\"Terminator 2\" is, like so many action films before it, a\u00a0paradoxically violent screed against violence. The film's reactionary politics are\u00a0essentially\u00a0dated, though\u00a0there are several\u00a0modern fanatics\u00a0who embody\u00a0the\u00a0paranoiac impulses that compel self-styled freedom fighter\u00a0Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) to fight against mental institutions, the police, and common sense to stop\u00a0artificially-intelligent computer system\u00a0Skynet from obliterating humanity in a nuclear war.\u00a0 Advertisement But it's important to note that\u00a0Sarah is\u00a0not the heroine of \"Terminator 2\" as she was in \"The Terminator,\" but rather a supporting character who helps raise both estranged son John (Edward Furlong) and\u00a0cyborg bodyguard/surrogate dad\u00a0T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger). The T-101 is the main character in \"Terminator 2\" since he, as he boasts, is a \"learning machine,\" capable of progressive\u00a0adaptation. This\u00a0was the path to war in the era of George H.W. Bush bipartisanship: using one lethal system to combat a more threatening system. Robots don't kill people\u2014people kill people.\u00a0 The T-101's burgeoning ersatz\u00a0humanity makes Schwarzenegger a perfectly re-purposed\u00a0tool. Director James Cameron had to convince the Austrian Oak\u00a0to turn\u00a0his humanoid baddie into a good guy, a jarring\u00a0transition that was partly difficult for Schwarzenegger to stomach due to the prior failure of\u00a0\"Conan the Destroyer,\" another sequel that was relatively lighter than its predecessor. But the T-101's role change\u00a0works as well as it does because viewers\u2014both then and now\u2014don't necessarily expect Schwarzenegger's deadpan killing machine to be capable of serving as anybody's\u00a0Jiminy Cricket-like moral compass. Still, that's exactly what the T-101 does when he re-unites John with Sarah, and learns from both characters first-hand the value of preserving human life. The T-101's change from a villain to a hero\u00a0also\u00a0reflects the ambivalent optimism at the heart of \"Terminator 2.\" Some cogs in the system can be retrained, but not all systems are benign. The psychiatric institution, represented by vainglorious Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), is tellingly dismissed since it keeps singular iconoclasts like Sarah down, and convinces them that they must genuinely want to\u00a0re-assimilate rather than just mimic a desire to change (in \"Terminator 2,\"\u00a0bad machines are good mimics, but good people are bad mimics). The cops, represented by the confounded\u00a0detectives who interrogate Sarah about her connection to the T-101 and the\u00a0gas-mask-making SWAT team that\u00a0tries to prevent the destruction of Skynet, are ineffectual, and hampered by a lack of emotional inspiration.\u00a0 Advertisement But\u00a0nuclear families, like the ones that surround well-meaning\u00a0scientist\u00a0Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) and good-natured survivalist Enrique Salceda (Castulo Guerra), are all positive since they represent a\u00a0bright future that must be protected\u00a0(hope must be preserved and defended instead of cultivated and maintained). So it makes sense that Sarah stops being\u00a0a machine-like human, and starts acting like a human machine when she encounters Miles and Enrique, but is either\u00a0suppressed, or threatened during her every encounter with security guards, orderlies, and cops. These central tenets of \"Terminator 2\"'s\u00a0fear-mongering worldview are also present in \"The Terminator,\" but they are perhaps more compelling in the sequel since they are a product of Cameron's singularly fanatic creativity. I imagine he\u00a0identified as the clean-burning machine, his vision hindered only by\u00a0unyielding crew members, pressing\u00a0budget restrictions, and the small-mindedness of anyone\u00a0who doesn't agree that bigger is necessarily better.\u00a0 For proof,\u00a0compare the way Cameron shoots violence in \"The Terminator\" with \"Terminator 2.\"\u00a0There's\u00a0more gore and impact-intensive massacres in the\u00a0former\u00a0film while the latter is characterized by the relatively sleek killing style of the T-1000, or even the scalpel-like precision of the T-101, who self-disassembles his left fore-arm\u00a0in \"Terminator 2\" much faster than he gouges\u00a0his right fore-arm and\u00a0his left eyeball\u00a0\"The Terminator.\" And while there\u00a0aren't\u00a0more\u00a0collisions and\u00a0car crashes\u00a0in \"Terminator 2\" than there are in \"The Terminator,\" there are bigger\u00a0explosions. \"Terminator 2\" oozes barely-sublimated tension that hails from Cameron's highly\u00a0personal vision, as we see during\u00a0formative car chases,\u00a0pyrotechnics, and body-morphing computer effects. In fact, one major\u00a0reason to revisit the \"Terminator 2\" is that the post-converted 3-D makes the film's textures that much richer, especially any surface covered in\u00a0fire, sweat, or light. Special effects designer\u00a0Stan Winston's\u00a0cyborg puppets and computer\u00a0effects are worth the extra couple of\u00a0bucks for 3-D, especially\u00a0his\u00a0body-deforming designs for the T-1000, like the bifurcated \"Pretzel Man,\" or the porous \"Donut Head.\"\u00a0 Schwarzenegger and his mostly excellent cast-mates may not\u00a0need a glossy technological reboot, but it is nice to be reminded on a big screen, through engrossing\u00a0close-ups, tracking shots, and\u00a0complex lighting set-ups, that Cameron knows how to use his human cogs to maximally service his hulking anti-authoritarian blockbuster.\u00a0His\u00a0maximalist style pays off big time, making \"Terminator 2\" that rare genre\u00a0classic that is every bit as good as its reputation.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "You've Been Trumped", "Review": "When purchased in 2007 by Trump, the land was a conservation area, with sand dunes 4,000 years old and a mixture of ocean-shore environments. \"We've had tremendous support from the environmentalists,\" Trump says to a TV interviewer, which is a bald-faced lie. We see spokesmen for U.K. environmental organizations who are bitterly opposed, and indeed his building permit was turned down by the local council before being restored by the Scottish Parliament on the grounds that it would bring jobs to the sparsely populated area. Advertisement But that isn't what's most fascinating about Anthony Baxter's one-man indie documentary. It's Donald Trump's almost joyous rudeness. The Donald loves playing a bad guy. One of his targets in the project are a few small farm homes that he fears would \"spoil the view\" of his luxury hotel guests. Having stayed at hotels in the area, I found the sight of farms added to my pleasure.  But listen to Trump describe Michael Forbes, a man who has refused to sell his strategically located land to the robber baron: \"The man lives in a pig sty. He lives in garbage. He's a pig.\" Say what? Has Trump ever visited the Forbes farm or been inside his home? Not bloody likely. What we see is a farm, with machinery, outbuildings, chickens, ponies and no pigs. I imagine Trump's idea of beauty is the antiseptic tackiness of the tinfoil towers he erects around the world. Trump's operation moves with cruel efficiency. Tons of sand are bulldozed from a virgin beach and piled up to create a small mountain blocking Forbes' view. His water and electricity are cut off, and when he visits the Trump site office, he is dismissed curtly. (\"Is that an expensive camera?\" Trump's man asks the director Baxter.) The local police later arrest Baxter and hold him in jail for four hours, on general principles. From what we see, they were unprovoked. We visit and meet Forbes, whose meticulously trimmed mustache alone should raise doubts about his piggish existence \u2014 all right, I'll say it \u2014 especially in contrast to what David Letterman describes as \"the thing that lives on Donald Trump's head.\" We also visit Susan Munro, who shows old movies of her father, a fisherman who lived on the very same spot, and David Milne, another indignant local. Local outrage inspires a protest march on the area. There's an uproar when a local university grants Trump an honorary degree; the school's former principal returns his own degree in protest. Trump proudly marches in with two hired bagpipers who hilariously accompany him everywhere he goes. The underlying message is that if you are rich and powerful enough, you can run roughshod over tradition and private property rights and buy your place at the table. One 18-hole course of Trump's new development opened in July, but construction on the 450-room hotel has been halted. Trump's reason for the delay is priceless: He threatened to move the development elsewhere because the windmills of an offshore wind farm will spoil the view of his guests. He announced his decision at about the same time he commenced his bid for the U.S. presidential nomination. Advertisement Do the math. To tee up at the Trump course will cost around $310, about the same as the world's first and most famous golf course, the Old Course in nearby St. Andrews. How many rounds of golf do you need to sell to pay for a luxury hotel? Can he make a go of the project without the hotel? Construction remains on hold. In medieval times, the nobility enjoyed something called droit du seigneur, their right to deflower their serfs' virgin daughters before their marriage. These days the nobility has been replaced by billionaire bullies, who continue to screw us serfs."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "On the Beach at Night Alone", "Review": "The inert Korean drama\u00a0\"On the Beach At Night Alone\" is a prime example of why personal art isn't necessarily good art. Writer/director Sang-soo Hong (\"Right Now, Wrong Then,\" \"The Day He Arrives\") has taken his real life extra-marital affair with actress/frequent collaborator Min-hee Kim, and created a painful series of talking points that never coheres into a coherent\u00a0drama. This is especially disappointing since\u00a0Hong's films generally rely on\u00a0his viewers' ability to recognize\u00a0patterns within pointedly similar narrative episodes. A typical Hong character\u00a0performs the same actions over and over again, with minor, but noticeably different results. Advertisement Unfortunately, the\u00a0drama in\u00a0\"On the Beach at\u00a0Night Alone\" isn't so involving. Scenes of\u00a0naturalistic small talk are fine enough, but Hong's drama grinds along\u00a0whenever\u00a0characters start to declaim, or make veiled proclamations\u00a0about marriage and personal freedom. Watching this film feels like running into a depressed, drunk friend who can't\u00a0stop himself from\u00a0yelling\u00a0about how terrible his life is, and\u00a0how much hurt he's causing others. You feel bad for your buddy, but after a certain point, hoo, man, look at the time, gotta run! \"On the Beach at Night Alone\" exemplifies all of the worst tendencies of Hong's films without many of his better qualities. It's\u00a0a typical Hong movie in the sense that Hong is concerned with a\u00a0woman's vaguely defined sense of\u00a0independence, and a couple of men's\u00a0growing irrelevance.\u00a0\"On the Beach at Night Alone\" is also\u00a0very much like Hong's other films in that it's unmistakably told from a man's point-of-view. The words Hong puts in Kim's mouth may, in fact, reflect a keen insight into his lover's feelings. But, outside of that context, Kim's character, an\u00a0aimless actress\u00a0named\u00a0Young-hee, often\u00a0rationalizes\u00a0deeply personal, and painful feelings--on Hong's behalf.\u00a0 Young-hee spends the first third of \"On the Beach at Night Alone\" talking circles around her mild-mannered friend Jeeyoung (Young-hwa Seo). Almost every\u00a0one of Jeeyoung and Young-hee's conversations concern\u00a0the latter woman's romantic affair with a married man. Young-hee seems resigned to this situation, so she only speaks passionately about this relationship within the abstract:\u00a0everybody should have the right to independence, and happiness, or variations thereof become a common speechifying theme. This is probably\u00a0because Hong's wife has, in real life,\u00a0refused to grant him a divorce. So now he promotes his affair with Kim as much as possible in a vain ongoing attempt at getting his unhappy spouse to change her mind. Advertisement \"On the Beach at Night Alone\u00a0seems to enter a superficially denser thicket of meta-textuality at around the 25-minute mark, when the film's\u00a0end credits prematurely\u00a0roll. Young-hee wakes up in a movie theater. And for a moment, it seems like the suffocatingly myopic nature of Young-hee's man problems are a little more sensible. This movie is an open-ended plea\u00a0from Hong to his audience:\u00a0don't judge me too harshly, I know I'm hurting my loved ones, but what else can I do? This partly explains the mysterious unnamed stranger in a black over-coat who\u00a0shadows Young-hee, like the personification of Hong, I mean Young-hee's guilty conscience, or maybe just her inability to deny the resentment and anger she's feeling about her current situation. This man in black is the revenge of Hong's subconscious. Too bad this movie is not about him. There are many minor flourishes, and points of interest in this film that might existing\u00a0compel Hong's fans--and maybe even viewers\u00a0who have never seen any of his other movies--to see \"On the Beach at Night Alone.\" But the last hour of this film won't change their mind one way or the other. This chunk of the film primarily consists\u00a0of monotonous variations on earlier scenes. Characters talk around, but rarely\u00a0directly\u00a0about what's bothering them. And eventually, after some coffee, cigarettes, and soju, they open up. At this point, you realize that Hong's characters'\u00a0seeming non-chalance and declarative insistence on\u00a0personal freedom stems from a deeply\u00a0private place that he\u00a0only wants to\u00a0talk about in the abstract. Because\u00a0Hong's films are nothing if not a reflection of his personality. For example, their dialogue-intensive style often invites comparisons\u00a0to the vital\u00a0work of French New Wave master Eric Rohmer. This is a natural comparison since both\u00a0filmmakers' respective bodies of work are\u00a0defined by discursive dialogue scenes about sex, ethics, and interpersonal responsibility.\u00a0 But \"On the Beach at Night Alone\" doesn't invite comparisons to Rohmer's films because it\u00a0has none of the wit, charm, or delicacy of Hong's superior films. Hong usually excels at an un-fussy,\u00a0prickly-funny sort of humor that's often best expressed during grace-less, booze-fueled shouting matches. But even those scenes are dull and shrill in \"On the Beach at Night Alone.\"\u00a0Hong has every right to express himself. But\u00a0that doesn't necessarily\u00a0mean that an authentic\u00a0declaration of his personality is worth watching. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "Life's a Breeze", "Review": "Lance Daly\u2019s \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d is as amiable and windswept\r\nas its title promises, for better or worse. One wishes it gusted a bit more\r\noften, but the always-great Fionnula Flanagan and truly charming newcomer Kelly\r\nThornton nearly justify the film\u2019s more sitcomish, hackneyed scenes. Nearly.\r\nHaving adored Daly\u2019s wonderful coming-of-age-meets-fairy-tale film \u201cKisses,\u201d I\r\nwas hoping for a bit more of that magic in \u201cBreeze,\u201d and, other than the\r\naforementioned two performances, one has to dig through too many false, forced\r\ncomedy beats to find them here. Advertisement Nan (Flanagan) is a good old-fashioned Irish hoarder. The Dublin\r\nresident has never been much trouble to her neighbors and generally keeps to\r\nherself. Her unemployed son Colm (Pat Shortt) joins forces with his other\r\nfamily members to give Nan a gift she could never give herself\u2014a clean house.\r\nNiece Emma (Thornton) takes Nan out for the day, and they return to a spotless\r\nhome. Old Chinese takeout menus, newspapers, broken kitchen appliances and an\r\noutdated TV: all gone. So is the old mattress Nan has been sleeping on for\r\ndecades. And shoving her money in because she doesn\u2019t trust the banks. That\u2019s\r\nright: there\u2019s a million Euros in a mattress now winding its way through the\r\nDublin recycling system. A wacky journey to find it ensues. Sort of. While \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d has an undeniably sitcomish\r\npresence, it\u2019s almost as if the realist in Daly refuses to embrace the\r\npotentially wacky set-up. And so we\u2019re stuck with a film somewhere in the\r\nmiddle. It's not as offensively slapstick-y as it could have been but it's not realism either. It's caught in the boring center of those two ends of the spectrum. To be fair, character beats between Flanagan and Thornton, particularly in the\r\nfinal act, are truly effective. Flanagan has always been a performer who can do\r\na lot with very little, and Thornton has the kind of natural screen presence\r\nthat announces someone on the film scene. She\u2019s the one performer here who\r\ntruly feels in the moment; at least partially because it feels like she\u2019s the\r\none character Daly truly likes. Daly\u2019s skill with slice of life connects in the scenes between\r\nNan and Emma, and they nearly justify the piece in just a few truthful glances. These are two\r\ninteresting characters brought to life by intriguing actresses. Too bad there\r\nisn\u2019t anything in \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d to support them. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "War, Inc.", "Review": "\"War, Inc.\" is a brave and ambitious but chaotic attempt at political satire. The targets: the war in Iraq, and the shadowy role of Vice President Dick Cheney's onetime corporate home Halliburton in the waging of the war. Dan Aykroyd plays an \"ex-vice president,\" unmistakably Cheney, issuing orders to CIA hit man Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to assassinate a Middle Eastern oil minister named Omar Sharif (not much of a joke), whose plans to build a pipeline in his country run counter to the schemes of the super corporation Tamerlane. Advertisement Hauser is an intriguing character, seen chugging shot glasses of hot sauce for reasons that are no doubt as significant as they are obscure. \"I feel like a refugee from the island of Dr. Moreau,\" he confides at one point to the onboard computer on his private plane, a sort of sympathetic HAL 9000. Arriving in the country of Turaqistan, he finds warfare raging everywhere, except within a protected area known as the Emerald City, for which of course we are to read Baghdad's Green Zone. Here American corporations are so entrenched that Hauser reaches the secret bunker of the Viceroy (a Tamerlane puppet) through a Popeye's Fried Chicken store. That sort of satire runs through the movie, which is neither quite serious nor quite funny, but very busy with trying to be one or the other. Lots of other brand names (in addition to Brand Hauser) appear in connection with an expo being staged by public relations whiz Marsha Dillon (Joan Cusack), who becomes Hauser's cynical adviser. Among her plan for the expo: The televised wedding of Middle Eastern pop superstar Yonica Babyyeah (Hilary Duff, but you won't recognize her). Arriving in Turaqistan about the same time as Hauser is Natalie Hegalhuzen (Marisa Tomei), a reporter for liberal magazines, whose character and others in the film illustrate my First Law of Funny Names, which teaches us that they are rarely funny. She is a warm, pretty woman who quickly appeals to Hauser, already having second thoughts about his hit-man role. She's smart, too, with an occasional tendency to talk like she's writing (she describes Yonica as \"a sad little girl who's been pimped out into a pathetic monstrosity of Western sexuality\"). All of the story strands come together into a bewildering series of solutions and conclusions, in which the fictional heritage of the name \"Emerald City\" plays a prominent role. But the intended satire isn't as focused or merciless as it could be and tries too hard to keep too many balls in the air. The movie's time period is hard to nail down; the opening titles refer to the \"21st century,\" but of course that's the present, and current names are referred to (McLaughlin, Anderson Cooper, Cheney, Katie Couric, 50 Cent, etc). One particularly brilliant invention is Combat-O-Rama, which is a version of a Disney World virtual reality thrill ride allowing journalists to experience battle through what I guess you'd call \"virtual embedding.\" Advertisement John Cusack is the power behind the film, as star, top-billed writer and one of the producers. He deserves credit for trying to make something topical, controversial and uncompromised. The elements are all here. But the parts never come together. Cusack has made 56 films and is only 42 years old, and his quality control is uncanny. He shies away from unworthy projects and is always available to take a chance. A project like \"War, Inc.\" must not have been easy to finance, shows a determination to make a movie that makes a statement and is honorable. Sometimes the best intentions don't pay off. I wanted to like it more than I could."}
{"Stars": 3.5, "Title": "The Exiles", "Review": "Homer is already three-quarters smashed. He buys a beer, sprawls in a booth, and looks over the crowd in the bar. Through his eyes, we see them too: Down-and-out alcoholics, loosely or happily or angrily tilting the long-necked bottles of beer to their mouths. One old man has something wrong inside, and has to drink sideways, at a tilt. Another old man peers out from under his hat, taking it all in without eye contact. A young white guy is rock-and-rolling with a small Chinese man, in a movement that seems poised between dancing and fighting. Most of the others are Native Americans. Homer rolls his bottle off the table, and it smashes. Advertisement  Homer Nish is one of several American Indians who are followed for most of a day and all of a night in Kent MacKenzie\"s \"The Exiles,\" a sad and beautiful film about a group of hard-timers in Los Angeles, circa 1960. MacKenzie was a USC film student at the time; he died in 1980. His film, photographed in stunning 35mm b&w by Erik Daarstad, Robert Kaufman and John Morrill, would have been a key work of the New American Cinema, the Cassavetes generation, if it had ever been seen. It played three film festivals, never got picked up for distribution, has survived only in a low-quality 16-mm print. Now the UCLA Film and Television Archive has restored it, apparently working from the original materials, and it looks like it was made yesterday. Milestone has picked it up, will exhibit it in \"selected theaters,\" and then release it on DVD. It is like cracking open a time capsule. \t\"The Exiles\" in the title are Indians who have left reservations to live in Los Angeles. They were already exiles, of course, when they lost their ancestral lands and were confined to the reservations. Those we meet are alcoholics, marginally employed, locked in a cycle of drinking and carousing and fighting all night. In footage shot over many months, MacKenzie used his \"cast\" to recreate a typical day. It begins in the kitchen of Homer's wife, Yvonne Williams, the most sympathetic character. She fries pork chops and serves them on white bread to her husband and his buddy Tommy Reynolds, and then the two join friends in a convertible, drop her off at an \"all-nite\" movie, and hit the town. \tHomer and Yvonne both have voice-over narrations. Homer talks about looking for \"a little action--you know, a score, a fight, some action.\" Yvonne, who is pregnant, says she used to go to church and pray for what she wanted, but she has stopped going to church and doesn't always say her prayers. She would like her unborn son to go to college, but since she married Homer that seems unlikely to her. Tommy is the ringleader, deep-voiced, egging others on. \tOn their night of travel we see a Los Angeles that no longer exists. Charles Bukowski might appear in some of these shots, for all I know. Just like in San Francisco, there is a streetcar that angles up a hill--gone, along with the hill. It is all skyscrapers now, but read the signs in the film: \"Coffee and a donut, 10 cents.\" \"Rooms $5 an hour, $10 a night.\" Cops on the beat, twirling their nightsticks. Shoes on sale, $7. The crowd in the film greeting the dawn on a hilltop with beating drums, more drinking, more fighting, everybody always smoking. Advertisement \tHow would this film have affected me in 1961? I saw Cassavetes' \"Shadows\u201d about that time, knew what the first wave of American independents were doing, would have known it was special. But now it has such a tragic poignancy. These people are doomed, unless a lucky few found sobriety. Their tears and blood have alike dried. The juke box music is so happy, and they move to it so dutifully. I am reminded of Scorsese's \"Who's That Knocking at My Door\" and \"Mean Streets.\" Different ethnic groups, same dead end. When you can walk into a bar and call everyone by name, that doesn't mean you have a lot of friends. It means you have a fate, and are returning to seek it."}
{"Stars": 4.0, "Title": "The New Girlfriend", "Review": "With its\r\ncombination of potentially volatile story elements\u2014including offbeat comedy,\r\nmelodrama, undertones of suspense and an extremely fluid contemplation of\r\ncontemporary sexual mores\u2014\u201cThe New Girlfriend\" is a\r\nsort of cinematic high-wire act in which even the slightest misstep could send\r\nthe entire thing crashing to the ground in a mess of smutty farce and mawkish\r\nsoap operatics. Not only does the film keep itself aloft for the duration, one\r\nof its greatest pleasures is seeing how filmmaker Francois Ozon manages to find\r\njust the right note for such challenging material. He transforms what might\r\nhave been a tonal nightmare in other hands into a wildly entertaining work, one that\r\nmanages to be simultaneously funny, touching, slightly unnerving and undeniably\r\nsexy to behold, regardless of where your predilections may lie. Advertisement The film opens with a funeral, then charts the lifelong friendship between Claire (Anais\r\nDemoustier) and Laura (Isild Le Besco) from the moment that they first meet at\r\nthe age of seven, and become instant BFFs through first loves and first\r\nheartbreaks to their marriages\u2014Laura to the dashing David\r\n(Romain Duris) and Claire to Gilles (Raphael Personnaz). It seems so perfect\r\nthat one awaits the other shoe to drop, and it soon does when Laura\r\nunexpectedly takes ill and soon dies, leaving a devastated David to raise their\r\ninfant daughter, Lucie, alone and an equally bereft Claire to cope with her\r\nequally profound sense of loss. Since she is Lucie's godmother, Claire decides\r\nthat the best way to deal with the tragedy is to do all that she can to help\r\nDavid care for the girl whenever she can. One day, she goes over to their house\r\nunannounced and when she goes in, she sees a strange woman holding the baby\r\nthat turns out to be David in a wig, makeup and one of Laura's dresses. Needless\r\nto say, Claire is more than a bit taken aback by this sight, and David is forced\r\nto explain things. For as long as he can remember, he's had a thing about\r\nwearing women's clothing, though he stresses that this desire has nothing to do\r\nwith sexuality and that he is still straight. When he met and married Laura,\r\nthis compulsion receded; now that she has gone, the desire has returned\r\nfull-force. As an added side benefit, Lucie, who is too young to remember\r\nLaura in anything but the most general of details, seems to be responding well\r\nto this ersatz version of her. Once she comes down from the initial shock, Claire\r\nis willing to embrace this new side to David and even helps him to further\r\ndevelop this new side to him by dubbing this alter ego \"Virginia,\"\r\nshowing her how to act more feminine and even taking him out into the real\r\nworld to interact with others as a woman.  With a\r\nset-up like this, \"The New Girlfriend\" could go in any number of\r\nnarrative directions, ranging from dark suspense (as was apparently the case\r\nwith Ruth Rendell short story's from which, according to the credits, it was\r\n\"loosely adapted\") to the kind of semi-transgressive, self-aware\r\nmelodrama that Pedro Almodovar built his career upon. Without going into too\r\nmuch detail so as not to spoil anything, the film goes off in a number of\r\ndirections that nevertheless manage to flow together with surprising grace.\r\nThere is a lot of humor to be had in the story, and for the most part, it\r\nmanages to eschew the usual broad hijinks that occur when a man turns up\r\ndressed as a woman; at one point, David is forced\r\nto make a quick change when his former mother-in-law arrives unexpectedly but\r\nforgets to remove his lipstick. At the same time, there is a serious side to\r\nthe story as Claire finds herself keeping the existence of Virginia a secret\r\nfrom the more straight-laced Gilles and David dealing with his own identity\r\nissues. Meanwhile, conventional notions of gender and sexuality are constantly\r\nbeing reexamined and revised throughout\u2014beyond the obvious involving\r\nDavid/Virginia, Claire also goes through a change as well as she assumes a more\r\nmasculine presence, both when she and Virginia are out in public together, and\r\nin bed with Gilles. Advertisement Ozon's screenplay is clever and\r\nintriguing throughout, while still maintaining a clear through line for viewers\r\nto follow even when things start getting really complicated. The performances\r\nare strong across the board\u2014Duris finds the humor and\r\npathos in his character without ever becoming a cartoon, Demoustier (who in\r\nmany ways has the trickier role when you think about it) is wonderful in the way\r\nthat she helps to navigate viewers through the increasingly tricky emotional\r\nand sexual waters and, as the more conservative-leaning husband, Personnaz\r\nbrings life and personality to a character that could have easily become a\r\ncaricature. All the technical aspects are top-notch as well, and the film even\r\nmanages to pull off the difficult trick of putting a man in a dress and not\r\nmaking it look like an old Milton Berle routine\u2014Duris\r\nmay not be 100% convincing as a woman but he certainly comes closer to that\r\nmark than most on-screen cross-dressing attempts manage to achieve.\u00a0 Although\r\nhis name may not be that well-known outside of auteurist circles, Francois Ozon\r\nis one of the most audacious filmmakers on the world cinema scene today,\r\nespecially when it comes to sexually charged material. Among his efforts are the international hit \"Swimming\r\nPool\", \"In the House\" and the teen call girl drama\r\n\"Young and Innocent.\" Even when he isn't dealing with overtly erotic\r\nmaterial, he is always out there trying to provide audiences with something new\r\nand unexpected\u2014his wild \"8 Women\" brought together eight of France's top actresses (including veterans\r\nCatherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, Emmanuelle Beart, Fanny Ardant and\r\nDanielle Darrieux and relative newcomers Virginie Ledoyen and Ludivine Sagnier)\r\nfor a musical murder mystery\u2014and even when he stumbles, as\r\nwas the case with 2009's \"Ricky\", a baffling fable about a baby born\r\nwith a pair of wings that allow him to fly, he still goes down swinging for the\r\nfences. \"The New Girlfriend\" is a film that finds him at the top of\r\nhis game, and the results will intrigue and arouse audiences in equal measure."}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Darfur Now", "Review": "We all know, having absorbed it from the mediasphere, that genocide is taking place in Darfur, but we do not all know where Darfur is. Africa, yes, vaguely, we realize. Something to do with Sudan. But where or what is Sudan? If it accomplishes nothing else, \"Darfur Now\" locates Sudan on the map (10th largest nation on Earth, just below Egypt -- boy, are we dumb) and tells us Darfur is its western region, almost the size of France. The region is landlocked in central Africa, bordered by Libya, Chad and the Central African Republic. More than that, the film provides faces for the people of Darfur. Advertisement One of them is Hejewa Adam, who wears an automatic rifle over her shoulder. She was a peaceful villager until government-backed \"Janjaweed\" (Arab fighters on horseback) killed her 3-month-old son. Now she is a fighter who sees no other option. Another person on the ground is Ahmed Mohammed Abakar, a farmer forced off his land, who has become a refugee leader. And we meet Pablo Recalde, in charge of distributing food from the world to Darfur, where much of it is stolen by the Janjaweed. It would appear that the function of the Janjaweed is to destroy the villages of Darfur, remove the people from their (subsistence level) agriculture and starve them. That is because they are not the same as other Sudanese. It is instructive that Darfur and Sudan were independent entities living in relative peace before they were arbitrarily cobbled together by the 19th century British-dominated Egyptian government, one of many African \"nations\" created by European colonial powers with no regard for local history, languages or tribal identity. Outside Darfur, a key player is Luis Moreno-Ocampo, a prosecutor for the International Criminal Court at The Hague, who seeks to prosecute Sudan for genocidal crimes, but finds opposition because many important nations, China included, value their oil trade with Sudan and care little about impoverished Darfur. Meanwhile, a quarter of a million have starved and perhaps 2 or 3 million have lost their homes or lands. Cut to California, where the admirable Don Cheadle, joined by George Clooney, leads a movement to inspire American and European intervention. He learned about genocide firsthand while making \"Hotel Rwanda.\" And we meet Adam Sterling, a student who begins a movement to divest California of its investments in Sudan. It is successful, and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger gladly signs such a bill into law, although its impact may be more symbolic than economic. Washington remains aloof from the issue, apart from the speeches of involved senators. All of this you will learn and see in \"Darfur Now.\" It is not a compelling documentary (too much exposition, not enough on-the-spot reality), but it is instructive and disturbing. Darfurians like Hejewa Adam await the arrival of \"the Americans\" to save her land. Perhaps she should announce she is building a nuclear program."}
{"Stars": 1.0, "Title": "The House", "Review": "In theory, any movie starring Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler\u2014with a supporting cast that includes Jason Mantzoukas, Nick Kroll, Michaela Watkins and Rob Huebel\u2014should be comedy gold. In theory, these actors should be able to just show up, be themselves, tap into their formidable improvisational abilities and let the laughs flow freely. In reality, though, movies require scripts. They require actual characters and dialogue and narratives that evolve in ways that are logical, or at least engaging. \u201cThe House\u201d has two credited screenwriters: first-time feature director Andrew Jay Cohen and his frequent collaborator, Brendan O\u2019Brien, who also teamed up to write the \u201cNeighbors\u201d movies and \u201cMike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.\u201d But the result is loose to the point of being sloppy, with allegedly wacky outtakes before the closing credits that provide a glimpse into the production process. Advertisement Ferrell and Poehler can only do so much with barely-there characters in half-baked situations. Because they hardly feel like people\u2014about halfway through, I realized I didn\u2019t even know their characters\u2019 names\u2014the extraordinary scheme they\u2019ve concocted for themselves makes no sense and has no momentum.\u00a0It also has no laughs, or at least precious few, which is why a movie with this caliber of star power is being sneaked into theaters without being shown to critics ahead of time.\u00a0 Also in theory, besides being a raunchy, R-rated comedy, \u201cThe House\u201d aims to be a movie that reflects our current economic reality, in which it\u2019s not necessarily guaranteed anymore that our kids will go to college, build careers and establish better lives for themselves than we have. But that\u2019s at odds with the way these characters actually live, one of the many glaring inconsistencies that plague \u201cThe House.\u201d Ferrell and Poehler star as Scott and Kate Johansen, nerdy suburbanites who live in a spacious home in a charming, leafy village called Fox Meadow. Their teenage daughter, Alex (Ryan Simpkins), has just been accepted to her dream school of Bucknell University. But for some reason, Scott and Kate never set aside any money for her college education; despite their well-off status, it\u2019s unclear what they do for a living, and in an unfunny running bit, Scott is terrible with numbers. So they rely on the annual scholarship the town awards\u2014only this year, soulless city councilman Bob (Kroll) plans to use that money for a lavish community pool. On an ill-advised trip to Las Vegas with their gambling-and-porn addicted pal, Frank (Mantzoukas), they hatch a scheme to create an underground casino in Frank\u2019s house. He\u2019s in the middle of an ugly divorce, and his angry, estranged wife (Watkins) has cleared out much of the furniture, so there\u2019s plenty of room for a craps table and a roulette wheel and such. Frank even sets up a bunch of safes for stashing the cash. Since they\u2019re the house\u2014and the house always wins\u2014they should make enough money to pay for Alex\u2019s college education in no time. Advertisement In and of itself, this is not a hilarious premise. Ostensibly, the sight of soccer moms and doughy dads showing up, letting loose and losing their money is intended to provide some knowing laughs: \u201cIt\u2019s true! We get old and we get lame.\u201d But \u201cThe House\u201d escalates into such debauchery and depravity so quickly, it\u2019s jarring, and it depletes the film of essential comic build-up. All of a sudden, the casino features a fight club between housewives in yoga pants and a spa that provides massages with happy endings. The clientele includes Wall Street blowhards doing blow on any surface they can find. And the real criminals in town, led by Jeremy Renner in an all-too-brief cameo as a mob boss, show up to shut them down. Cohen cuts so briskly from each scenario to the next that they never register. And the most significant shift of all\u2014the one that occurs within Scott and Kate\u2014is the most extreme and the least plausible. Out of nowhere, she\u2019s smoking pot non-stop and he\u2019s reinvented himself as an enforcer known as \u201cThe Butcher.\u201d They start wearing flashy, gangster-style clothing. And in case we couldn\u2019t detect for ourselves that they\u2019ve entered shady territory, the theme from \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d plays in the background at one point.\u00a0 This idea of a husband and wife tapping back into their former wild side worked much more successfully in the \u201cNeighbors\u201d movies\u2014especially the first one\u2014because they firmly established who Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne\u2019s characters were, as individuals and as a couple, before they allowed their primal urges to take hold.

{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Black Sea", "Review": "Peanut butter and chocolate. Fish and chips. The heist movie and the submarine picture.\u00a0These things go together so perfectly that it's a wonder they were ever apart.\u00a0 \"Black Sea\" combines its two genres with such enthusiasm that although the gears don't mesh perfectly and some of the story beats are predictable, the result is so altogether pleasurable that I can't imagine fans of either genre failing to enjoy it.\u00a0Directed by Kevin MacDonald (\"The Last King of Scotland\") from an original script by playwright Dennis Kelly, it's about a laid-off English submarine captain (Jude Law) who gets lured by a shady company into assembling a crack team of nautical misfits to board a refurbished Soviet sub, dive to the bottom of the Black Sea, and loot a wrecked U-boat full of Nazi gold. Advertisement Like most submarine films, this is a pressure-cooker story about what happens when already-tense men pile into a glorified tin can and spend a few weeks underwater. And like most heist pictures, it's about a group of people who are drawn together by a common cause (personal enrichment\u2014or if you prefer, greed), then splinter into factions during crises and start acting from insecurity, egotism, and fear. You could retitle the film \"Under the Ocean's 11\" if it weren't stocked with such misbegotten, miserable people.\u00a0 Law's character, Robinson, is not your typical iron-jawed Navy hunk. He's more of a working-class hero type, as bitterly angry about his lot in life as the protagonist of a 1950s kitchen sink drama. When the story begins, he's looking for redemption after losing his wife and child to, well, the sea; he spent the better part of 30 years in submarines, returning home only occasionally, and finally his spouse decided she'd had it. Now Robinson has nothing from his marriage but flashbacks to a beach vacation. Robinson's half-English, half-Russian crew are variations on his type: guys who don't fit into life on land, see themselves as martyrs to dog-eat-dog capitalism, and treat the mission as a Hail Mary pass at re-creation. They've all either been phased out of the new economy or never fit into it in the first place, due to personal flaws (alcoholism, socipathy, a tendency to take a wrench to the skull of anyone who crosses them, that kind of thing). And now they're all in the same boat, so to speak, risking everything for One Last Big Score.\u00a0The film wears its allegorical/political aspirations on its grimy sleeve, but these tend to enliven rather than deaden the action, because they remind you of what the mission means to everyone. This is especially helpful when things start going from challenging to hellish. Robinson's motivational rants against robber-barons might've been delivered on a soapbox in a town square in about 1926, but damned if they don't do the trick. Advertisement Robinson is a strong leader, but only if you define strength as a mix of scary intensity and a knack for pushing other people's buttons. His sailors are basically an assortment of giant, walking buttons, and as Robison hammers on them, they hammer on each other. The Russians (Grigory Dobrygin, Konstantin Khabensky, Sergey Seksler, Sergey Klesnikov, Sergey Puskepalis) are all stereotypically grim, taciturn Slavic types, many of whom have been outfitted with Perfect Storms of facial hair; the way MacDonald frames and lights them, etching their faces in desiccated shades of red, ochre and sea-foam green, they could be unnamed figures on the covers of 18th century fiction anthologies (Joseph Conrad, probably). The English are more talkative, demonstrative and needy. Like the Russians, they're all variations on familiar adventure-movie types, including the casually murderous psycho (Ben Mendelsohn's Fraser) and the teenaged newbie (Bobby Schofield's Tobin) whose innocence strikes fatherly chords in our otherwise cynical skipper. There's also a company man named Daniels (Scoot McNairy), who's so much like the glad-handing sleazeball yuppie Burke from James Cameron's \"Aliens\" that you're not surprised when he replicates some of Burke's more treacherous maneuvers, gesture-for-gesture. \"Black Sea\" looks so gorgeous and moves with such muscular grace that you might forget, or never imagine, that it's a relatively small action movie. It was shot with digital cameras the size of napkin dispensers, mainly inside a 1967-vintage Soviet \"Hunter-Killer\" sub owned by a private collector in the Medway River in the town of Rochester, in Kent. Once the characters batten down the hatches, about 90% of the story occurs within the confines of the submarine, with occasional cutaways that show a miniature version of the vessel diving, surfacing, taking on water, or navigating obstacles. MacDonald and his crew seem not only to have studied the classics of the submarine genre (notably \"Das Boot,\" \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" and \"Crimson Tide\") but to have borrowed specific camera moves and shots (including tilted angles that convey emotional as well as spatial imbalance). \u00a0 There are moments when the script leans too heavily on \"because I said so\" storytelling, pushing the plot to wherever it needs to go without coming up with a way to make it seem as though it's getting there organically. (The psycho Fraser is particularly irritating in this regard; he's at the center of so many sudden, horrendous crises that it makes you think less of Robinson for being reckless enough to hire him.)\u00a0 Nevertheless, \"Black Sea\" holds together, thanks mainly to its airtight rhetorical scheme (the crew members truly are little guys trying to grab a piece of the economic pie that's normally hoarded by one-percenters) and its keen sense of what's actually required to carry out this kind of mission, in terms of materials, training and temperament. Because the script does such a good job of explaining what needs to happen in order for the mission to succeed, your heart starts to race when things don't go as planned. These guys are, in every sense of the phrase, in over their heads, and under ungodly pressure. No wonder they start to crack. Advertisement The film is a technical triumph, filled with keenly judged performances. First among equals is Law, who's managed to pull off a Matthew McConaughey-esque resurgence in recent years, discovering a singular charisma in middle age that he mostly failed to put across in youth. Law will probably never not be handsome, but in this film, his handsomeness feels lived-in, and strangely tragic; with his receding hairline, pasty skin and near-permanent scowl, he seems less like a Hollywood matinee idol than one of those quietly seething fellows at the end of a bar that you know better than to try to cheer up. His coiled anger pulls the story together, and makes the hero comprehensible and sympathetic when he's behaving horribly. Even when Robinson spirals into \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\"-style mania, pushing the crew to its breaking point in pursuit of a fortune that seems increasingly elusive, you don't hate him, because you understand where he's coming from. \u00a0His parting closeup is magnificent: an image of an unappreciated man who's reached his full potential at last."}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Title": "The Invasion", "Review": "\"The Invasion\" is the fourth, and the least, of the movies made from Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel The Body Snatchers. Here is a great story born to be creepy, and the movie churns through it like a road company production. If the first three movies served as parables for their times, this one keeps shooting off parable rockets that fizzle out. How many references in the same movie can you have to the war in Iraq and not say anything about it? Don Siegel's classic \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1956) was about alien pods that arrived on Earth, sucked up the essence of human hosts and became duplicates of them -- exact copies, except for what made them human. It was widely decoded as an attack on McCarthyism. Phil Kaufman's \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978), inexplicably described by Pauline Kael as \"the American movie of the year,\" was said to have something to do with Watergate and keeping tabs on those who are not like you. Abel Ferrara's \"Body Snatchers\" (1993), by far the best of the films, might have been about the spread of AIDS. Advertisement And \"The Invasion\"? One of the alien beings argues persuasively that if everyone were like them, there'd be no war in Iraq, no genocide in Darfur -- no conflict in general, I guess, although they don't seem to have much of a position on global warming. I don't have a clue what the movie thinks, if anything, about Iraq, which is mentioned so frequently, but it may be a veiled attack on cults that require unswerving conformity from their members. Which cults? I dunno. In all four movies, alien spores arrive on Earth from space. In the early films, they take the form of pods, which look like very large, brown snow peas. Some viewers complained after Kaufman's movie that they couldn't believe aliens could truck those pods all over San Francisco, to which the obvious reply is: Do you expect a movie titled \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" to be plausible? In Oliver Hirschbiegel's new version, the spores piggyback on a returning space shuttle that crashes and scatters debris from Dallas to Washington. Anyone who touches the debris gets the infection, which is then spread by the exchange of vomit (in more ways than you might imagine). In Washington, a psychiatrist named Carol (Nicole Kidman) has a patient who complains, \"My husband just ... isn't my husband anymore.\" Versions of this line do duty in all four films. The pod people look like the people they occupy and have the same memories (\"Remember Colorado?\"), but they walk like mannequins with arthritis, except when they're running like zombies. Carol's estranged husband, Tucker (Jeremy Northam), is a disease control expert who becomes infected, and after four years, suddenly wants to start spending time with their child Oliver (Jackson Bond). Little Oliver texts his mom that his dad is ... different. Carol's current good friend is a doctor named Ben (Daniel Craig), who is one of many to notice a new \"flu virus\" that is spreading through the land. His colleague, a researcher named Dr. Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), gets a sample of the virus, and in a performance that would be the envy of every scientist since Galileo, gazes at it through a microscope and almost immediately explains what it is, how it reproduces, how it takes over when we fall asleep and (apparently only a day or two later) how to defeat it with an antibody that can seemingly be manufactured so quickly and in such quantities that it can be sprayed from crop-dusters. By this point, the movie has lost all coherence, not to mention flaunting a scene where a helicopter lands atop a towering skyscraper in Washington, where federal law decrees no building can be taller than the Capitol. Advertisement This may not be entirely Hirschbiegel's fault. Warner Bros., the movie's distributor, didn't approve of his original version, and brought in the Wachowski siblings to rewrite it and James McTeigue (\"V for Vendetta\") to direct their revisions. All three served time on the \"Matrix\" movies: just the team you'd want to add a little incomprehensible chaos. The genius of the Ferrara version was to make his very sympathetic heroine a young girl on an Army base, who can't get anyone to listen to her. You know how adults can be when kids claim they've seen aliens. The problem with this new version is that it caves in and goes for your basic car chase scenes (spinning tires, multiple crashes, car in flames, dozens of pod people hanging onto it, etc). If aliens are among us, we will not be saved by stunt driving. Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Jeremy Northam, little Jackson Bond, Jeffrey Wright and other cast members do what they can with dialogue that can hardly be spoken, and a plot that we concede must be implausible but does not necessarily have to upstage the Mad magazine version. And the aliens themselves are a flop. Just like zombies, they're pushovers: easy to spot, slow-moving, not too bright, can be shot dead or otherwise disposed of. OK. Now we've had \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" twice, \"Body Snatchers\" once and \"The Invasion\" once. Somebody should register the title \"Of The.\""}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Danish Girl", "Review": "Can a movie be impeccably made\u2014well-cast and strongly acted, flawlessly appointed and gorgeously shot\u2014yet still leave you cold?

Such is the conundrum with \u201cThe Danish Girl.\u201d Given that he\u2019s telling the story of real-life artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne)\u2014the first-known person to undergo sexual reassignment surgery nearly a century ago when he transformed himself into Lili Elbe\u2014director Tom Hooper plays it dismayingly safe. As was the case with his Oscar-winning \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cLes Miserables,\u201d Hooper\u2019s latest is tasteful and restrained to a fault. It is easier to admire than love. And maybe that\u2019s intentional to some extent. Maybe\u2014in adapting Lucinda Coxon\u2019s script, based on David Ebershoff\u2019s novel about the 1920s Danish landscape painter\u2014Hooper aims to reach the widest possible audience by presenting such potentially challenging material in the form of a lush prestige picture. Advertisement Maybe the thinking is that the vast majority of people would be more likely to see a movie about a transgender character if it were offered as awards bait, to use a phrase that\u2019s pejorative but apt, rather than a scrappy little indie like \u201cTangerine.\u201d Between both of these movies\u2014and the award-winning television series \u2018Transparent,\u201d and the well-documented saga of Caitlyn Jenner\u2014the struggles transgender people have endured have been part of the consciousness and dialogue this past year like never before. \u201cThe Danish Girl\u201d may seem zeitgeisty through sheer timing\u2014and that may seem cynical on the surface\u2014but it\u2019s clear that its heart is in the right place. But speaking of the heart, \u201cThe Danish Girl\u201d is more likely to appeal to the head. Admittedly, there\u2019s some striking imagery that will surely grab you: tutus hanging backstage at the ballet, illuminated from below like tulle jellyfish, or the crisp symmetry of immaculate, identical row houses, shot in widescreen. During a rare daring moment, Einar visits a peep show to mimic the stripper\u2019s moves, and the two end up in a spontaneous sort of dance through the glass. But there are also plenty of images that are rather obvious and simplistic in their symbolism: a sheer sheet hanging between Einar and his wife Gerda (Alicia Viklander) at bedtime, providing a physical separation, or a scarf blowing away in the wind as Alexandre Desplat\u2019s score soars with it. The excellent \u201cTangerine,\u201d by contrast, may seem like a daunting prospect: Sean Baker\u2019s film, about a pair of trash-talking transgender prostitutes tearing through the streets of Hollywood on Christmas Eve, stars first-time actresses and was shot entirely on an iPhone. But it actually ends up being the more accessible of the two films; it\u2019s got an immediacy and a vibrancy that \u201cThe Danish Girl\u201d sorely lacks, as well as a genuine sense of emotional connection. This is no fault of the film\u2019s stars, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, who both give deeply committed performances\u2014although one is stronger than the other. Redmayne has proven himself a technical master of transformation; his precise performance as Stephen Hawking in last year\u2019s \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d understandably earned him an Academy Award for best actor. Once again, he\u2019s playing a real-life figure who undergoes a physical change that puts a strain on his marriage and forces both partners to reexamine their fractured bond, even as it\u2019s clear that they still love each other. Advertisement Hooper, working with his usual cinematographer, Danny Cohen, luxuriates in Redmayne\u2019s androgyny as Einar steadily morphs into Lili. (Those cheekbones! Those lips! Those long, elegant limbs!) And Paco Delgado\u2019s Jazz Age costume design is just decadent\u2014not only for Redmayne but for the cast as a whole. But the film regards this complex figure in a way that\u2019s mostly superficial. We never truly understand what drives Einar to become Lili completely, despite the physical danger and the social stigma; the character becomes a collection of mannerisms and proclamations. Certainly she was brave, but grasping the source and depth of that bravery would have made her feel like a fully fleshed-out person worthy of more than just polite appreciation. The story that\u2019s truly intriguing is the one that belongs to Vikander as Einar\u2019s wife, Gerda\u2014a fellow painter who struggled to be taken seriously in her husband\u2019s shadow until she asks Einar to sit for a portrait of a ballerina and gets her first glimpse of his feminine side. Although Einar is the one who changes physically, Gerda is the one with the more compelling emotional arc. She\u2019s in the tricky spot of having to be the rock but also evolve with an ever-changing situation, and doing so gives her more opportunities for shading. At first, she\u2019s accepting of Einar wearing lingerie under his suits and even a little turned on by it; playing dress-up at home eventually inspires them to enjoy lavish evenings among their friends in Copenhagen, just a couple of girls out on the town. But as it becomes increasingly clear that \u201cLili\u201d isn\u2019t just a persona but rather an expression of Einar\u2019s true self, Gerda has to grapple with the fact that everything she\u2019s known to be safe and true is crumbling beneath her. At the same time, her career as a portrait artist is finally flourishing\u2014with the blossoming Lili as her muse. And as friends new (Ben Whishaw) and old (Matthias Schoenaerts) enter the equation to lend support in various forms, they muddle matters further. Advertisement Vikander, who\u2019s been on such a roll this year already in two extremely different films\u2014the exquisite \u201cEx Machina\u201d and the glossy romp \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d\u2014makes every moment of her character\u2019s journey believable with great nuance, from her strength and optimism to her confusion and loneliness. There\u2019s a lovely delicacy to her but also a directness that\u2019s equally appealing. The title refers to Redmayne\u2019s character and the transformation he underwent to make his outsides match his insides (to borrow a line from another recent beautiful but chilly domestic drama, Angelina Jolie Pitt\u2019s \u201cBy the Sea\u201d). But Vikander may actually be the film\u2019s true star."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Uncertain Terms", "Review": "While some\r\nfilmmakers desire to fill their authorship with resplendent narratives and\r\npainstaking characters, director Nathan Silver wants what\u2019s underneath,\r\nabove, and in-between all that.

Advertisement Based on a story\r\nco-written with Chloe Domont and cinematographer Cody Stokes, \u201cUncertain Terms\u201d is the low-fi\r\nobservance of a person looking for a type of home in an atypical domestic\r\nscenario, a set-up that has intrigued Silver in previous 70-minute features \u201cExit Elena\u201d (2012) and 2013\u2019s \u201cSoft in the Head.\u201d In this tale, the\r\nmisplaced focal character is Robbie (played by David Dahlbom, cinematographer\r\nof \u201cExit Elena\u201d), who ventures to\r\nthe house belonging to his aunt Carla (played by Cindy Silver, mother of\r\nNathan), which is a shelter for pregnant teens. While serving as low-key\r\nhandyman for the property, Robbie tries to clear his head of his recent marital\r\ntrauma. His wife, Mona, cheated on him. Haunting him through a barrage of texts\r\nand voicemails, she desperately wants him back.  While embroiled in\r\nthis angst, Robbie begins to particularly enjoy the warming company of Nina,\r\none of the shelter\u2019s guests who has\r\nrelationship issues of her own. Her boyfriend Chase (Casey Drogin) is a\r\ndirectionless dum-dum, who only confirms Nina\u2019s uncertain future as to how she\u2019ll take care of her\r\nnewborn, and with whose support. Robbie and Nina\u2019s brief interactions, friendly but\r\nintimate, incites jealousy in fellow teen Jean (Tallie Medel), who showed\r\ninitial interest in Robbie despite his polite deflections.  Though glacially paced, \u201cUncertain Terms\u201d benefits\r\nfrom its sense of stakes, in which it finds characters right before their lives\r\nare about to completely change\u2014maybe Robbie and Nina will be able to do so together. The\r\nshared emotional angst of a cheated husband doesn\u2019t\r\ncompute equally with the encompassing stress of an unwanted teen pregnancy, but\r\nthat\u2019s a hooking character flaw of self-righteousness within Dahlbom\u2019s\r\nRobbie that makes him most interesting. Though he\u2019s\r\ntrying to pull everything together, he\u2019s hit\r\na peak of recklessness, projecting upon a young woman who has plenty of her own\r\npersonal business to deal with. In \u201cUncertain\r\nTerms\"' unique brand of bizarre,\r\nthis is some finite poetry about that self-destructive period in the aftermath\r\nof a relationship\u2019s implosion.  Advertisement Silver\u2019s filmmaking has always been quite the haven for naturalistic\r\nperformances, this time expressing the promise of female leads Menuez and\r\nMedel. What\u2019s bothersome about \u201cUncertain\r\nTerms\u201d is how the other women\r\nin the shelter are treated, especially with the story\u2019s\r\nopenly economical sense about soaking in its environment. Aside from the\r\naforementioned two, the other young women in the shelter are walking\r\nback-stories more than they are characters, used for scenes of sharing their\r\nunintended pregnancies more than glimpses of who they are as flesh-and-blood\r\nbeings. The film\u2019s admirable intentions to provide a non-taboo presentation of\r\npregnant teens without the protective quirk of 2007\u2019s \u201cJuno\u201d or the tidy religiosity of 2014\u2019s \u201cGimme\r\nShelter\u201d are nearly undone by\r\nediting that takes away their personality. A lining issue in his authorship,\r\nSilver\u2019s interests in the reflexes within intimate interaction are\r\noften too stubborn to find truth beyond such reenactments of real life.  Still, this film has a narrative feat that can\u2019t go\r\noverlooked, one that\u2019s certainly better executed than the Bradley Cooper-Emma Stone\r\npairing in Cameron Crowe\u2019s recent \u201cAloha.\u201d Silver\u2019s \u201cUncertain\r\nTerms\u201d is able to fully bond\r\ntwo characters with a vivid, kind-of inappropriate relationship that\u2019s\r\nhard to wrap one\u2019s head around when first billowing, but becomes validated once\r\ndenouement proclamations show it to be of sincere desperation. The gut-feeling\r\npower within Robbie and Nina\u2019s unique connection can\r\nbe felt in a scene in which he confides in her his perspective on falling in\r\nlove young; how you\u2019ve got to grow together with someone and you grow yourself, and\r\nchange yourself to fit this other person. If that\u2019s\r\ntaken away, it\u2019s even harder to start over. It\u2019s a\r\nmoment that shows a distinct grasp of filmmaking mojo (even if concludes with\r\nSilver\u2019s emblematic shrugging cynicism). It also declares that Silver\u2019s\r\nperspective is not so much a definitive answer to truth in storytelling, but a\r\nmiss-miss-hit tactic in which desires of precision are voided for the breaths\r\nthat will undoubtedly have more matter than than others. Contrary to Silver\u2019s\r\nairy aspirations, it nudges towards the idea that film is more about what we\r\ncan take away from the atmospheres in which directors place us."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Hitman's Bodyguard", "Review": "The charismatic stars of \u201cThe Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard\u201d\u2014Ryan Reynolds shifting into lovable-loser gear as a down-graded protection agent for hire, Samuel L. Jackson in macho-and-mouthy mode as a profanely proficient deadly assassin and Salma Hayek as the sexy spitfire of a spouse who is devoted to him\u2014all combust with masterful comic chemistry as they play off their well-established cinematic personas. As for the high-speed vehicular stunts, they are breathless, relentless, endless\u2014and a bit too numbingly generic. Advertisement Still, the main concept of lethal frenemies who must put aside their grudges for a common goal is a tried-and-true trope, as writer Tom O\u2019Connor acknowledges with echoes of everything from \u201c48 HRS.\u201d and \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith\u201d to \u201cMidnight\u00a0Run\u201d and \u201cThe Gauntlet.\u201d But the real draw, much like Russell Crowe vs. Ryan Gosling in \u201cThe Nice Guys\u201d and Kevin Hart vs. Dwayne Johnson in \u201cCentral Intelligence,\u201d is the odd-couple matchup. Hearty laughter does ensue as Reynolds\u2019 cautious Michael Bryce is forced to keep Jackson\u2019s reckless Darius Kincaid safe while transporting him from London to the Hague so he can testify against a genocidal Belarusian tyrant. As the villain, Gary Oldman\u2014sadly, not exactly running on all thespian cylinders\u2014recycles his Russian accent from \u201cAir Force One\u201d while his disfigured face appears to be coated in crusty bread crumbs. Luckily, the main dudes are on the ball as they race against the clock during their hazard-prone road trip while turning the art of bickering into a non-stop aria of foul-mouthed mutual belligerence and, eventually, reluctant respect. When Bryce complains that Kincaid keeps putting him in harm\u2019s way, Jackson goes full bellow: \u201cI AM harm\u2019s way. My job is to harm.\u201d Of course, the bodyguard should know that since his passenger has attempted to take him down no less than 28 times over the years. There are in-jokes, such as when Bryce grouses that Kincaid \u201csingle-handedly ruined the word \u2018motherfucker.'\" There are also musical beats, as Kincaid insists on drunkenly singing a bluesy number to pass the time in the car, while Bryce counters by warbling a falsetto version of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cI Saw the Sign.\u201d And little did I think I would ever see Jackson gleefully harmonizing in a van filled with habit-wearing Italian nuns as if he were trying out for the Mother Superior in \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d That doesn\u2019t even cover the contributions of Hayek, whose Sonia is being kept in a Dutch jail in order to guarantee Kincaid will provide evidence against Oldman\u2019s baddie. It is a hoot to see the actress calmly strike yoga poses behind bars as she fiercely lashes out like a flame-thrower at any law official stupid enough to hassle her. Meanwhile, she intimidates her cellmate into standing in the corner. Maybe Hayek should book a guest appearance on \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d But one of the best scenes is a flashback showing how Kincaid met Sonia when she was a waitress at a Mexican bar, swooning over how she took care of hand-sy male customers by cutting them with broken beer bottles. The use of Lionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d in the background adds a nice romantic touch. Advertisement Less successful is Bryce\u2019s attempt to reunite with onetime squeeze Amelia (French import Elodie Yung), an Interpol agent whom he blames for getting a client of his shot. The flashback to their first lusty encounter at a funeral is cut short by the arrival of murderous thugs. But the actors can\u2019t summon the same kind of heat generated by Jackson and Hayek, who calls her hubby \u201cLa Cucaracha,\u201d since she says, \u201cHe\u2019s un-killable.\u201d\u00a0 While no one is going to mistake \u201cThe Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard\u201d for high art, it will please those in the mood for late-summer fun. But why did I feel so emotionally depleted by the cartoony chaos unleashed in the name of entertainment by director Patrick Hughes (\"The Expendables 3\"), when the body count among the mostly anonymous victims of violence\u2014often dispatched in the name of humor\u2014began to balloon to astronomical proportions? The nearly constant annihilation of no-good-niks increasingly gnawed at me considering how much of the vehicular mayhem takes place in cities where terror attacks earlier this year were conducted on major urban thoroughfares\u2014namely, London and Amsterdam. Nothing like real horrifying incidents to turn what was meant as a fantasy into a mirror\u2014and that includes the tragic death in Charlottesville. There is also a streak of nasty sadism when Oldman\u2019s meanest mercenary corners Bryce in a garage where he resorts to an ax, a hammer, and a metal chain used as a noose and, ultimately, a gun to vanquish his opponent. Cruel jokes too often become hollow jokes. Besides, I believe when it comes to action thrillers beyond the realm of comic-books that older audiences\u2014who lately are also the most loyal audiences in actual theaters\u2014hunger for more thoughtful stories and compelling characters in the vein of \u201cHell or High Water\u201d or \u201cWind River.\u201d Even something as pop-fizzy as \u201cBaby Driver\u201d has a beating heart and a sense of moral purpose in its engine. At one point, Kincaid does bring up an existential conundrum: Who is in the most righteous profession? He who kills evil doers or he who protects those who commit evil? That is about as deep as this carnage-a-thon gets."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Fighter", "Review": "Micky Ward has less personality than the hero of any other boxing movie I can remember. Maybe that's because he can't get a word in edgewise. He has a motormouth crackhead for a brother, a mom who acts as his manager and seven blond-headed sisters who seem to be on a break from a musical being filmed on the next soundstage. It's easy to imagine Micky growing up in this family and sitting ignored in the corner. David O. Russell's \u201cThe Fighter\u201d is based on Ward's true story, and perhaps Micky (Mark Wahlberg) is flat and withdrawn here because he is in life. His family is spectacularly dysfunctional. Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), his half-brother, is the failed version of what Micky hopes to become: a poor kid from Lowell, Mass., who wins because of his ability to outlast savage punishment and finally land a winning blow. Advertisement Micky grew up hero-worshipping Dicky, who lost a lot of fights but allegedly knocked over Sugar Ray Leonard once upon a time. Then Dicky got hooked on crack, and now we see him as a goofy, scrawny guy with a Skeezix haircut, a cigarette behind his ear and an arm around his brother's shoulders. They're being filmed for an HBO documentary, which Dicky thinks is about his own unlikely comeback and everybody else knows is about his decline and fall. Crackheads sometimes get the two confused. As the movie opens, Micky doggedly begins a series of defeats in bad matchups. Then his life changes when he meets a sweet-faced, tough-talking barmaid named Charlene (Amy Adams). She knows the neighborhood, knows the story and knows that Micky's problem is his family. His mother, Alice (Melissa Leo in a teeth-gratingly brilliant performance), sees both boys as performers in a long-running tribute to herself. She presides in a living room filled with her seven daughters, who smoke so much and use so much hairspray, they must be considered fire hazards. When Micky gets a chance to train seriously in Vegas, Charlene more or less forces him to take it. When Dicky and Alice follow him out there, it's showdown time, and Charlene threatens to leave. But the movie is imprecise about how this plays out, and they're all at ringside at the end. The weakness of the film is the weakness of the leading role. That's not a criticism of Mark Wahlberg, who has a quite capable range, but of how he and Russell see the character. Micky comes across as a proud, not very bright, very determined man who has apparently never given his family much constructive thought. To say of your family, \u201cthey're my family!\u201d is true enough, but may not be sufficiently analytical. His love for Charlene is real, but he never quite realizes he really must choose between her vision and his mother's. His character remains strangely unfocused. That's not the case with Dicky, Alice and Charlene, and those characters are where the life is. Christian Bale, who has played Batman and John Connor in \"Terminator,\" and for Werner Herzog played a man who survived in the jungles of Laos, so successfully transforms himself that you foresee a career as a cutup in the \u201cJackass\u201d movies. Melissa Leo (\u201cFrozen River\u201d) is merciless in her depiction of Alice; steering her son to failure is more rewarding than having him succeed on his own. She's one of those women, you know the type, who likes the way she looks posing with a freshly lit cigarette. And look at Amy Adams, our beloved \u201cJunebug\u201d and the nun in \u201cDoubt,\u201d who is clear-headed and has a strong will and tries to lend those qualities to the man she loves. There are a lot of fight scenes, not as visceral as those in \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d \u201cRocky\u201d or \u201cThe Wrestler,\u201d but designed more to represent the POV of a sportswriter or fan. Because we aren't deeply invested in Micky, we don't care as much as we should, and the film ends on a note that should be triumph but feels more like simple conclusion. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 3.0, "Title": "Back to Burgundy", "Review": "In \"Red Obsession,\" a documentary about the wine industry in France's Bourdeaux region, Francis Ford Coppola describes drinking a glass of wine that had been bottled four years after the French Revolution. \"Wine tells a story,\" says Coppola, who wonders if Thomas Jefferson or the Marquis de Lafayette had had a glass of the same wine. The story-telling power of wine is the context of C\u00e9dric Klapisch's \"Back to Burgundy,\" a film detailing a year in the life of a fictional wine-making family in Burgundy. The taste of the family wines propel the characters back into the past, wrinkling up time for the characters. \"Back to Burgundy\" has a gentle low-stakes mood (although the actual stakes are often quite high), and the script (also by Klapisch) is episodic in structure. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. When the film focuses on the wine-making process, in the progression from vine to bottle, it's a fascinating and detailed look at a very specific subculture. Advertisement When his father becomes ill, Jean (Pio Marma\u00ef) returns home to the family vineyard in France after 10 years abroad. There has been little to no contact between Jean and his two siblings, Juliette (Ana Girardot) and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie (Fran\u00e7ois Civil). When their father dies, the siblings must make some serious decisions about the family business. Unable to pay the huge inheritance tax, they consider their options. They could sell the vineyard to pay the tax. They could rent out part of it. J\u00e9r\u00e9mie has married into another wine-making family, and it's expected he will step up to be a partner in his father-in-law's business. Jean, with a girlfriend and son back in Australia, has no intention of staying in France. That leaves Juliette. It's now up to her to make the decisions for the upcoming harvest, and she doesn't have her father to consult. When Jean, Juliette and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie were children, their father would blindfold them and make them taste the family wines, quizzing them. \"Behind the lemon, is there another fruit?\" he asks. Juliette was always the best at this game. Their dead father (\u00c9ric Caravaca) haunts the film, in flashbacks but also sometimes literally. Jean converses and argues with the ghost of his dead father, similar to how the ghost of the father was used in HBO's \"Six Feet Under.\" Like Jean, Nate in \"Six Feet Under\" is the son who left, who refused the father's legacy. But unlike \"Six Feet Under,\" where the presence of the father's ghost was a constant, woven into the fabric of the show, \"Back to Burgundy\" uses the device indifferently and intermittently. There's no commitment to the trope, leading to a slightly cheesy result. The same is true for the moments when time folds in on itself, and the child versions of Jean, Juliette and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie surge into the frame where the adults are now standing. If the film had a more frankly poetic and symbolic structure, if it was less literal, these devices might have had more thematic reverb. Where the film is on firmest ground is in specifics of the culture of wine-making: the seasonal workers showing up, the rowdy parties at the end of the harvest, the taste-testing during the fermenting process, the worried glances at the sky, the obsessive checking of Weather Apps. In these sequences, the film really knows what it is doing, knows what it wants to say and convey. There's a whole section where Juliette has to throw around her weight as the boss for the first time, and publicly reprimands one of the seasonal workers for initiating a grape-fight in the fields. He pushes back against her authority. This altercation has an unexpected denouement later on, and unlike many of the other sequences, this one sparks with life, spontaneity, the unexpected. Advertisement Each sibling has a specific emotional arc. Jean stays on in France longer than he had planned, to help with the upcoming harvest, causing strife with his girlfriend and son back home. Juliette is thrust into the leadership position of the vineyard. J\u00e9r\u00e9mie is infantilized by his new in-laws, and needs to make a stand as his own man. Some of these plot-lines are interesting, some are drawn out into practically slow-motion lengths, almost the way sub-plots are elongated during a season of television. The language is often so on-the-nose it's shocking it wasn't excised at some point in the process. (Jean saying in Voiceover: \"Love is like wine. It takes time. It needs to ferment\" is just one example.) The episodic quality of the script shows its awkward skeleton in the sequences where one scene presents a problem or conflict which is then resolved or answered in the next scene. Jean, in a fit of frustration, exclaims he doesn't care about the family vineyard at all, the land can go to hell as far as he's concerned. In the very next scene, Jean catches a neighboring farmer spraying pesticides on an area overlapping with the family vines, and flies off the handle. His girlfriend (Mar\u00eda Valverde), visiting from Australia, comments, \"I guess you do care about the land after all.\" Along with the in-your-face music creating a mood so insistently that scenes barely have a chance to breathe, \"Back to Burgundy\" wants to make sure we get the connections. Proust's madeleine never worried so much. Still, \"Back to Burgundy\" has much in its favor. The three main actors create a believable sense of the kind of intimacy and silliness and intensity adult siblings often share. This is easier said than done. Juliette's journey into the light as the real wine-maker of the family, the natural inheritor of her father's legacy, is\u2014in its way\u2014the most satisfying arc in this film of many arcs. At every step of the way, she is forced to make decisions, decisions which had always been her father's call in the past. Are the grapes ready to be harvested? Is it time to stop the fermenting process? Sometimes she just doesn't know. In a family where tradition is everything, where things have been done the same way for generations, her decision to go with her own nose\u2014to decide what kind of wine she wants to make (as opposed to trying to replicate what she thinks her father would do) is a quietly feminist act. It's the only arc in \"Back to Burgundy\" not underlined obsessively by music and voiceover dialogue, but it's the arc that left the most pleasing aftertaste. Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "Birthmarked", "Review": "\u201cI think of a newborn baby\u2019s mind as a blank book.\u201d This famous Walt Disney quote is the first thing that appears on screen in Emanuel Hoss-Desmarais\u2019 eccentric, funny-ish comedy \u201cBirthmarked.\u201d Disney\u2019s words are immediately followed by the wintery image of a rural family of five, which comes into view like an awkward, DIY Christmas card, with parents and siblings standing on snowy grounds in front of a charming lake cottage. We detect a doze of comedic tension in the air right from the start and slowly recognize that the unease among family members is caused by something more than the daily pressures of parenthood and ordinary sibling-to-sibling enmity. Advertisement What the title of the film doesn\u2019t completely achieve, the Disney saying does: it subtly spells out the themes of Desmarais\u2019 film before its adequately amusing humor (through a script penned by Marc Tulin) introduces the viewer to the younger selves of the now-parents Catherine (Toni Collette) and Ben (Matthew Goode). Both coming from a long line of prestigious scientists, the two high-IQed scholars meet in graduate school and prove to make a perfect match in the lab as well as the bedroom. Allured by the idea of proving the ultimate power of \u201cnurture\u201d over \u201cnature,\u201d the pair decides to raise an unusual family, infusing their children with the necessary tools and knowledge to challenge their genetic predispositions. Can you really grow up to be something you\u2019re not born as? Catherine and Ben quit their jobs and jointly elect a life dedicated to proving that no one has to be obstructed or defined by their lineage. Enter the eccentric millionaire/scientist Gertz (Michael Smiley), who agrees to fund the research project for his own set of mysterious scientific goals. Soon enough, Catherine and Ben (expecting a baby) move to the countryside with their Russian research assistant Samsonov (Andreas Apergis), and adopt two kids, whom they\u2019d raise alongside their own biological son Luke (Jordan Poole) like lab rats. Luke gets put on a steady diet of highbrow art. When upset, he is asked to sing his feelings out. His science-leaning genes get completely disregarded. Maya (Megan O\u2019Kelly), despite not being the offspring of intellectuals, is asked to engage with everything from a brainy, rational lens and is fed foods with high iron value to enhance her cognitive development. Maurice (Anton Gillis-Adelman), on the other hand, is encouraged to channel his violent leanings (which he inherited from his biological parents) towards peaceful harmony. But would the 12-year-long experiment to nurture an accomplished artist, a brainy intellectual and a peace-loving pacifist ultimately work? Don\u2019t expect \u201cBirthmarked\u201d to resolve into an earth-shattering conclusion. It\u2019s not likely to challenge your balanced views on the topic of \u201cnurture\u201d vs. \u201cnature\u201d when the kids act up in benign ways and get into trouble for listening to Iron Maiden. But for what it\u2019s worth, Hoss-Desmarais\u2019 film does provide some quirky laughs along the way, accompanied by Fionnula Flanagan\u2019s fairy-tale-esque voiceover narration. It\u2019s a highly fanciful package that might fool you into thinking that you\u2019re in whimsical Wes Anderson territory where kids revolt and teach their elders a lesson they won\u2019t forget. Advertisement Unfortunately, the film\u2019s appeal doesn\u2019t extend that far beyond its shiny surface. Always a compelling screen presence, Toni Collette delivers upon her character\u2019s inner ethical dilemma. The increasingly mad-eyed Matthew Goode and Michael Smiley in the (overwrought) role of the power-hungry Gertz also offer some witty delights. But \u201cBirthmarked\u201d ultimately falls short of bringing the emotion home. As viewers, we always find ourselves on the outside, desperately trying to break into the minds of the kids. Somehow, the film doesn\u2019t allow us to get to know them, save for during a segment when their scholarly aunt comes for a visit to observe the young ones. It\u2019s no surprise that \u201cBirthmarked\u201d finds new life when we finally hang out with Luke, Maya and Maurice while they act like the sweet kids they are. To the film\u2019s defense, their parents don\u2019t quite interact with the kids\u2019 real selves either\u2014so as viewers, we are at least not alone. Our experience surely carries echoes of how the children are treated in a lab-like, appallingly strict environment where certain types of music are banned and books are burned; where they\u2019re conditioned to hide their urges under taught and prescribed behavior. \u201cBirthmarked\u201d eventually makes a vague point about conservative parenting and unravels a less-than-satisfying twist. But it never quite swells your heart like a film on familial love and bonding should."}
{"Stars": 0.0, "Title": "Nine Lives", "Review": "What brave strangers joined me at a morning showing of \u201cNine Lives,\u201d which was deemed not worthy enough to screen early for critics? A solo gray-haired woman, who seemed far more interested in consuming her large bag of popcorn than in what was displayed on the multiplex screen. A middle-aged lady, accompanied by a young girl age four or five, who spent the entire nearly 90-minute running time staring at her cell phone. And, me, someone who is at least being paid to give up part of her own life to see \u201cNine Lives,\u201d a supposed family comedy about a billionaire real-estate tycoon who becomes trapped in the body of a tomcat. Advertisement That is it. Just four people, in spite of a cast that boasts two Oscar winners\u2014Kevin Spacey and Christopher Walken, who must have some hefty overdue bills they need to pay off\u2014along with a director, Barry Sonnenfeld, who continues to shred his reputation as a sharp filmmaker, which was earned after the massive success of the decades-old \u201cMen in Black\u201d and \u201cAddams Family\u201d franchises. Like cats, audiences can sometimes sense when something is no good. Let\u2019s just say I have been to wakes that have elicited more laughs. Just which of the five screenwriters that scribbled this catastrophe (I am allowed at least one feline pun, aren\u2019t I?) thought it was a good idea to revive the body-switch gimmick from the \u201880s and mate it with the workaholic-dads-are-bad theme from the \u201890s? Clich\u00e9s remain clich\u00e9s if you don\u2019t make an effort to somehow re-invent them for a new generation. Not that there isn\u2019t an attempt at reflecting today\u2019s headlines, as Spacey\u2019s self-centered Manhattan mogul Tom Brand fusses over details concerning the size of a tower bearing his company name instead of attending his daughter\u2019s 11th\u00a0birthday party. He throws a snit fit when it appears that an edifice located in Chicago might prevent him from having the tallest phallic symbol in the Northern Hemisphere. Let\u2019s see. Rich, egotistical, self-centered, insulting, short-tempered and obsessed with the length of his manly skyscraper. Who does that sound like? To make amends, Brand ends up buying a cat at a rather strange pet emporium overseen by a rather strange proprietor played by Walken. On the way home with the gift, he decides to make a pit stop on the top floor of his tower and is struck by lightning. That means Spacey can pretty much dial in the rest of his part just by doing a voiceover since his character now takes the form of a cat known as Mister Fuzzypants (not funny) while his comatose body lies in a hospital bed. I am guessing that anyone tempted to see \u201cNine Lives\u201d would be anticipating plenty of four-pawed high jinx to chortle over. Isn\u2019t that why YouTube is littered with such clips (some of which actually start off the film)? But even this dog person knows that cats generally like to call their own shots, which explains why the puss here is primarily an obvious CG creation. Advertisement Too bad the human actors couldn\u2019t have CG stand-ins as well. No one, not even Jennifer Garner as Brand\u2019s hapless second wife and Cheryl Hines (\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d) as his bitter ex, is left unscathed. Not when probably the lone, close-to-humorous notion revolves around Walken\u2014the only person besides the audience who can hear Spacey\u2019s thoughts\u2014threatening to \u201cfix\u201d Mister Fuzzypants (still not funny) unless he changes his priorities in life.\u00a0 There are numerous topics that stretch the notion that the PG-rated \u201cNine Lives\u201d is fine for most ages, beyond the expected pee and poop gags. How lovely that the cat gets drunk on 50-year-old Scotch, and Hines, who takes some verbal hits as the shrewish first wife, guzzles martinis at a kiddie birthday party. Garner, forced to do most of her scenes with a camera-hog cat who probably has never even seen Garner's own fine body-switch work in \u201c13 Going on 30,\u201d is revealed to have been considering a divorce.\u00a0Pulling the plug on Spacey comes under discussion. Even worse, it appears that a suicide is in the offing during the movie\u2019s climax.\u00a0 And, oh, how the kindergarten crowd will chortle at the lame sight gag involving a \u201cHang in There, Baby\u201d poster that hails from the early \u201870s. Which leads me to this question: Just who is supposed to be the target audience for \u201cNine Lives\u201d? Certainly not feline fanciers, since we are told that, \u201cCats don\u2019t care if you live or die.\u201d Definitely not fans of Spacey, who did a much better coma on the most recent season of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d or Walken, whose trademark wild mass of hair seems more limp than usual. It all goes to prove one thing: That Walt Disney knew what he was doing when he made \u201cThe Shaggy Dog\u201d instead of \u201dThe Shaggy Cat.\u201d"}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Title": "The Incredible Hulk", "Review": "\"The Incredible Hulk\" is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's \"Hulk\" (2003) too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences. By the time the Incredible Hulk had completed his hulk-on-hulk showdown with the Incredible Blonsky, I had been using my Timex with the illuminated dial way too often. Consider the dilemma of creating a story about the Hulk, who is one of the lesser creatures in the Marvel Comics stable. You're dealing with two different characters: Mild-mannered scientist Dr. Bruce Banner, and the rampaging, destructive Hulk, who goes into frenzies of aggression whenever he's annoyed, which is frequently, because the Army is usually unloading automatic weapons into him. There is even the interesting question of whether Dr. Banner is really conscious inside the Hulk. In the Ang Lee version, he was, more or less, and confessed to Betty Ross: \"When it happens, when it comes over me, when I totally lose control ... I like it.\" In this version by Louis Leterrier, the best Banner (Edward Norton) can come up with is that being the Hulk is like a hyperthyroid acid trip, and all he can remember are fragments of moments. Advertisement It's obvious that the real story is the tragedy that Banner faces because of the Hulk-inducing substance in his blood. But if Banner never turned into the Hulk, nobody would ever make a movie about him. And if the Hulk were never Banner, he would be like Godzilla, who tears things up real good but is otherwise, dare I say, one-dimensional. The Ang Lee version was rather brilliant in the way it turned the Hulk story into matching sets of parent-child conflicts: Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) was appalled by her father, the general (Sam Elliott), and Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) suffered at the hands of his father, a scientist who originally created the Hulk genes and passed them along to his child. (Nick Nolte had nice scenes as the elder Dr. Banner.) In the new version, Betty (Liv Tyler) still has big problems with her father the general (William Hurt); she's appalled by his plans to harness the Hulk formula and create a race of super-soldiers. In both films, Banner and Ross are in love, but don't act on it because the Hulk business complicates things way too much, although I admit there's a clever moment in \"Hulk\" 2008 when Bruce interrupts his big chance to make love with Betty because when he gets too excited, he turns into the Hulk, and Betty is a brave girl but not that good of a sport. Consider for a moment Gen. Ross' idea of turning out Hulk soldiers. They would be a drill sergeant's worst nightmare. When they weren't Hulks, why bother to train them? You'd only be using them in the fullness of their Hulkdom, and then how would you train them? Would you just drop thousands of Ed Nortons into enemy territory and count on them getting so excited by free-fall that they became Hulks? (This transformation actually happens to Banner in \"Hulk\" 2008, by the way.) So, what's to like in \"The Incredible Hulk\"? We have a sound performance by Edward Norton as a man who desperately does not want to become the Hulk, and goes to Brazil to study under a master of breath control in order to curb his anger. And we have Liv Tyler in full trembling sympathy mode. Banner's Brazilian sojourn begins with an astonishing shot: From an aerial viewpoint, we fly higher and higher above one of the hills of Rio, seeing hundreds, thousands, of tiny houses built on top of one another, all clawing for air. Advertisement This is the \"City of God\" neighborhood, and as nearly as I could tell, we are looking at the real thing, not CGI. The director lets the shot run on longer than any reasonable requirement of the plot; my bet is, he was as astonished as I was, and let it run because it is so damned amazing. The scenes involving Banner in Brazil are well conceived, although when he accidentally contaminates a bottled soft drink with his blood, the movie doesn't really deal with the consequences when the drink is consumed in the United States. The contamination provides Gen. Ross with his clue to Banner's whereabouts, and Army troops blast the hell out of the City of God; all through the movie, the general deploys his firepower so recklessly that you wonder if he has a superior, and if he ever has to account for the dozens, hundreds, thousands, who die while his guys are blasting at the Hulk with absolutely no effect. Enter Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a Marine who Gen. Ross recruits because he's meaner and deadlier than anyone else. Blonsky leads the chase in Rio. Later, Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), Banner's research associate, is forced to inject Blonsky with a little Hulkie juice, setting up a titanic rooftop battle in Harlem between Hulk and Blonsky. And this battle, as I have suggested, pounds away relentlessly, taking as its first victim our patience. \"Iron Man,\" the much better spiritual partner of this film, also ends with a showdown between an original and a copycat, but it involves two opponents who know who they are and why they are fighting.  When you get down to it, as a fictional creature, the Incredible Hulk is as limited as a bad drunk. He may be fun to be around when he's sober, but when he drinks too much, you just feel sorry for the guy."}
